PXD021374	33639093	Snapshots of native pre-50S ribosomes reveal a biogenesis factor network and evolutionary specialization. 	Snapshots of native pre-50S ribosomes reveal a biogenesis factor network and evolutionary specialization	bacteria, ribosome, shotgun	Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental multi-step cellular process that culminates in the formation of ribosomal subunits, whose production and modification are regulated by numerous biogenesis factors. In this study, we analyze physiologic prokaryotic ribosome biogenesis by isolating bona fide pre-50S subunits from an Escherichia coli strain with the biogenesis factor ObgE, affinity tagged at its native gene locus. Our integrative structural approach reveals a network of interacting biogenesis factors consisting of YjgA, RluD, RsfS, and ObgE on the immature pre-50S subunit. In addition, our study provides mechanistic insight into how the GTPase ObgE, in concert with other biogenesis factors, facilitates the maturation of the 50S functional core and reveals both conserved and divergent evolutionary features of ribosome biogenesis between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
PXD011974	33640491	Proximity-dependent Mapping of the Androgen Receptor Identifies Kruppel-like Factor 4 as a Functional Partner. 	Proximity labeling proteomics of the androgen receptor reveals Kruppel-Like Factor 4 as a repressor of androgen-dependent genes	AR, KLF4, network, proximity	Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and the third cause of cancer mortality. PCa initiation and growth are driven by the androgen receptor (AR). The AR is activated by androgens such as testosterone and controls prostatic cell proliferation and survival. Here, we report an AR signaling network generated using BioID proximity labeling proteomics in androgen-dependent LAPC4 cells. We identified 31 AR-associated proteins in nonstimulated cells. Strikingly, the AR signaling network increased to 182 and 200 proteins, upon 24 h or 72 h of androgenic stimulation, respectively, for a total of 267 nonredundant AR-associated candidates. Among the latter group, we identified 213 proteins that were not previously reported in databases. Many of these new AR-associated proteins are involved in DNA metabolism, RNA processing, and RNA polymerase II transcription. Moreover, we identified 44 transcription factors, including the Kru ppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), which were found interacting in androgen-stimulated cells. Interestingly, KLF4 repressed the well-characterized AR-dependent transcription of the KLK3 (PSA) gene; AR and KLF4 also colocalized genome-wide. Taken together, our data report an expanded high-confidence proximity network for AR, which will be instrumental to further dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying androgen signaling in PCa cells.
PXD019945	33641263	Ex vivo glucocorticoid-induced secreted proteome approach for discovery of glucocorticoid-responsive proteins in human serum. 	Identification of candidate circulating glucocorticoid response biomarkers in humans using a proteomic approach	PBMC, biomarker, dexamethasone, glucocorticoid	PURPOSE: To identify glucocorticoid-responsive proteins measurable in human serum that may have clinical utility in therapeutic drug monitoring and the diagnosis of cortisol excess or deficiency. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A phased biomarker discovery strategy was conducted in two cohorts. Secretome from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from six volunteers after ex vivo incubation +/- dexamethasone (DEX) 100 ng/mL for 4 h and 24 h was used for candidate discovery and qualification using untargeted proteomics and a custom multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) assay, respectively. For validation, five candidates were measured by immunoassay in serum from an independent cohort (n = 20), sampled at 1200 h before and after 4 mg oral DEX. RESULTS: The discovery secretome proteomics data generated a shortlist of 45 candidates, with 43 measured in the final MRM-MS assay. Differential analysis revealed 16 proteins that were significant in at least one of two time points. In the validation cohort, 3/5 serum proteins were DEX-responsive, two significantly decreased: lysozyme C (p < 0.0001) and nucleophosmin-1 (p < 0.01), while high mobility group box 2 significantly increased (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Using an ex vivo proteomic approach in PBMC, we have identified circulating glucocorticoid-responsive proteins which may have potential as serum biomarkers of glucocorticoid activity.
PXD021837	33643238	Mechanisms of Manganese(II) Oxidation by Filamentous Ascomycete Fungi Vary With Species and Time as a Function of Secretome Composition. 	Mechanisms of Manganese(II) Oxidation by Filamentous Ascomycete Fungi Vary with Species and Time as a Function of Secretome Composition	biomineralization, filamentous fungi, geomicrobiology, manganese oxides, secretome	Manganese (Mn) oxides are among the strongest oxidants and sorbents in the environment, and Mn(II) oxidation to Mn(III/IV) (hydr)oxides includes both abiotic and microbially-mediated processes. While white-rot Basidiomycete fungi oxidize Mn(II) using laccases and manganese peroxidases in association with lignocellulose degradation, the mechanisms by which filamentous Ascomycete fungi oxidize Mn(II) and a physiological role for Mn(II) oxidation in these organisms remain poorly understood. Here we use a combination of chemical and in-gel assays and bulk mass spectrometry to demonstrate secretome-based Mn(II) oxidation in three phylogenetically diverse Ascomycetes that is mechanistically distinct from hyphal-associated Mn(II) oxidation on solid substrates. We show that Mn(II) oxidative capacity of these fungi is dictated by species-specific secreted enzymes and varies with secretome age, and we reveal the presence of both Cu-based and FAD-based Mn(II) oxidation mechanisms in all 3 species, demonstrating mechanistic redundancy. Specifically, we identify candidate Mn(II)-oxidizing enzymes as tyrosinase and glyoxal oxidase in Stagonospora sp. SRC1lsM3a, bilirubin oxidase in Stagonospora sp. and Paraconiothyrium sporulosum AP3s5-JAC2a, and GMC oxidoreductase in all 3 species, including Pyrenochaeta sp. DS3sAY3a. The diversity of the candidate Mn(II)-oxidizing enzymes identified in this study suggests that the ability of fungal secretomes to oxidize Mn(II) may be more widespread than previously thought.
PXD021926	33643546	Covalent conjugation of extracellular vesicles with peptides and nanobodies for targeted therapeutic delivery. 	A novel enzyme-mediated method for covalent surface modification of extracellular vesicles to achieve targeted drug delivery	RBCEVs, drug delivery, extracellular vesicles	Natural extracellular vesicles (EVs) are ideal drug carriers due to their remarkable biocompatibility. Their delivery specificity can be achieved by the conjugation of targeting ligands. However, existing methods to engineer target-specific EVs are tedious or inefficient, having to compromise between harsh chemical treatments and transient interactions. Here, we describe a novel method for the covalent conjugation of EVs with high copy numbers of targeting moieties using protein ligases. Conjugation of EVs with either an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting peptide or anti-EGFR nanobody facilitates their accumulation in EGFR-positive cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Systemic delivery of paclitaxel by EGFR-targeting EVs at a low dose significantly increases drug efficacy in a xenografted mouse model of EGFR-positive lung cancer. The method is also applicable to the conjugation of EVs with peptides and nanobodies targeting other receptors, such as HER2 and SIRP alpha, and the conjugated EVs can deliver RNA in addition to small molecules, supporting the versatile application of EVs in cancer therapies. This simple, yet efficient and versatile method for the stable surface modification of EVs bypasses the need for genetic and chemical modifications, thus facilitating safe and specific delivery of therapeutic payloads to target cells.
PXD018977	33643806	In Well-Treated Celiac Patients Low-Level Mucosal Inflammation Predicts Response to 14-day Gluten Challenge. 	Quantitative proteomics of coeliac gut during 14-day gluten challenge: low-level baseline inflammation despite clinical and histological normality predicts subsequent response	FFPE, coeliac disese, gluten challenge, human intestine, laser capture microdissection	In celiac disease (CeD), gluten activates adaptive immune cells that cause damage to the small intestinal mucosa. Histological evaluation of intestinal biopsies allows for grading of disease severity. CeD can effectively be treated with a life-long gluten-free diet. Gluten challenge of treated CeD patients is used to confirm diagnosis and to test drug efficacy in clinical trials, but patients respond with different magnitudes to the same gluten challenge. In this study of 19 well-treated CeD patients, proteome analysis of total tissue or isolated epithelial cell compartment from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded biopsies collected before and after 14-day gluten challenge demonstrates that patients with strong mucosal response to challenge have signs of ongoing tissue inflammation already before challenge. This low-level tissue inflammation at baseline is paralleled by increased gluten specific CD4+ T-cell frequencies in the gut and presence of a low-level blood inflammatory profile. Thus, apparently well-treated CeD is frequently not entirely quiescent, with presence of low-grade inflammation and antigluten immunity in the gut mucosa. Histology assessment alone appears insufficient to judge full recovery and gut mucosal healing of CeD patients. The findings raise a concern whether a seemingly proper gluten-free diet is able to curb gut inflammation in all CeD patients.
PXD017426	33647290	Molecular Characterisation of Titin N2A and Its Binding of CARP Reveals a Titin/Actin Cross-linking Mechanism. 	CARP/Ankrd1 Interacting Proteins in mouse heart	CoIP, MLP, dilated cardiomyopathy, heart	Striated muscle responds to mechanical overload by rapidly up-regulating the expression of the cardiac ankyrin repeat protein, CARP, which then targets the sarcomere by binding to titin N2A in the I-band region. To date, the role of this interaction in the stress response of muscle remains poorly understood. Here, we characterise the molecular structure of the CARP-receptor site in titin (UN2A) and its binding of CARP. We find that titin UN2A contains a central three-helix bundle fold (ca 45 residues in length) that is joined to N- and C-terminal flanking immunoglobulin domains by long, flexible linkers with partial helical content. CARP binds titin by engaging an alpha-hairpin in the three-helix fold of UN2A, the C-terminal linker sequence, and the BC loop in Ig81, which jointly form a broad binding interface. Mutagenesis showed that the CARP/N2A association withstands sequence variations in titin N2A and we use this information to evaluate 85 human single nucleotide variants. In addition, actin co-sedimentation, co-transfection in C2C12 cells, proteomics on heart lysates, and the mechanical response of CARP-soaked myofibrils imply that CARP induces the cross-linking of titin and actin myofilaments, thereby increasing myofibril stiffness. We conclude that CARP acts as a regulator of force output in the sarcomere that preserves muscle mechanical performance upon overload stress.
PXD023984	33647316	Identification of MKRN1 as a second E3 ligase for Eag1 potassium channels reveals regulation via differential degradation. 	ER-associated degradation of Eag1 potassium channels by the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase MKRN1: the presence of a dual ubiquitination system	MKRN1, RING E3	Mutations in the human gene encoding the neuron-specific Eag1 voltage-gated K(+) channel are associated with neurodevelopmental diseases, indicating an important role of Eag1 during brain development. A disease-causing Eag1 mutation is linked to decreased protein stability that involves enhanced protein degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase cullin 7 (CUL7). The general mechanisms governing protein homeostasis of plasma membrane- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Eag1 K(+) channels, however, remain unclear. By using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified another E3 ubiquitin ligase, makorin ring finger protein 1 (MKRN1), as a novel binding partner primarily interacting with the carboxyl-terminal region of Eag1. MKRN1 mainly interacts with ER-localized immature core-glycosylated, as well as nascent nonglycosylated, Eag1 proteins. MKRN1 promotes polyubiquitination and ER-associated proteasomal degradation of immature Eag1 proteins. Although both CUL7 and MKRN1 contribute to ER quality control of immature core-glycosylated Eag1 proteins, MKRN1, but not CUL7, associates with and promotes degradation of nascent, nonglycosylated Eag1 proteins at the ER. In direct contrast to the role of CUL7 in regulating both ER and peripheral quality controls of Eag1, MKRN1 is exclusively responsible for the early stage of Eag1 maturation at the ER. We further demonstrated that both CUL7 and MKRN1 contribute to protein quality control of additional disease-causing Eag1 mutants associated with defective protein homeostasis. Our data suggest that the presence of this dual ubiquitination system differentially maintains Eag1 protein homeostasis and may ensure efficient removal of disease-associated misfolded Eag1 mutant channels.
PXD012665	33647481	High VHL Expression Reverses Warburg Phenotype and Enhances Immunogenicity in Kidney Tumor Cells. 	Deciphering functions of VHL in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma	VHL, immunogenicity, proteostasis, renal cancer	Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a frequently occurring renal cancer. The Von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor VHL, a known tumor suppressor gene, is frequently mutated in about 50% of patients with ccRCC. However, it is unclear whether VHL influences the progression of ccRCC tumors expressing wild-type VHL. In the present study, we found that higher expression of VHL was correlated with the better disease-free survival (DFS) in ccRCC patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. We revealed that VHL overexpression in ccRCC cells inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-regulated triglyceride synthesis, and cell proliferation. Proteomic analysis provided us a global view that VHL regulated four biological processes, including metabolism, immune regulation, apoptosis, and cell movement. Importantly, we found that VHL overexpression led to up-regulated expression of proteins associated with antigen processing and interferon-responsive proteins, thus rendering ccRCC cells more sensitive to interferon treatment. We defined an interferon-responsive signature (IRS) composed of ten interferon-responsive proteins, whose mRNA expression levels were positively correlated with DFS in ccRCC patients. Taken together, our results propose that the subset of ccRCC patients with high VHL expression benefit from immunotherapy.
PXD013968	33648524	Splicing factors control triple-negative breast cancer cell mitosis through SUN2 interaction and sororin intron retention. 	Splicing factors control triple-negative breast cancer cell mitosis through SUN2 interaction and sororin intron retention	Triple-negative breast cancer, splicing	BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited therapeutic opportunities. Recently, splicing factors have gained attention as potential targets for cancer treatment. Here we systematically evaluated the role of RNA splicing factors in TNBC cell proliferation. METHODS: In this study, we performed an RNAi screen targeting 244 individual splicing factors to systematically evaluate their role in TNBC cell proliferation. For top candidates, mechanistic insight was gained using amongst others western blot, PCR, FACS, molecular imaging and cloning. Pulldown followed by mass spectrometry were used to determine protein-protein interactions and patient-derived RNA sequencing data was used relate splicing factor expression levels to proliferation markers. RESULTS: We identified nine splicing factors, including SNRPD2, SNRPD3 and NHP2L1, of which depletion inhibited proliferation in two TNBC cell lines by deregulation of sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) via increased sororin intron 1 retention and down-regulation of SMC1, MAU2 and ESPL1. Protein-protein interaction analysis of SNRPD2, SNRPD3 and NHP2L1 identified that seven out of the nine identified splicing factors belong to the same spliceosome complex including novel component SUN2 that was also critical for efficient sororin splicing. Finally, sororin transcript levels are highly correlated to various proliferation markers in BC patients. CONCLUSION: We systematically determined splicing factors that control proliferation of breast cancer cells through a mechanism that involves effective sororin splicing and thereby appropriate sister chromatid cohesion. Moreover, we identified SUN2 as an important new spliceosome complex interacting protein that is critical in this process. We anticipate that deregulating sororin levels through targeting of the relevant splicing factors might be a potential strategy to treat TNBC.
PXD022827	33649493	Surfactant-assisted one-pot sample preparation for label-free single-cell proteomics. 	Surfactant-assisted one-pot sample preparation for label-free single-cell proteomics	Surfactant-assisted one-pot sample preparation coupled with MS (SOP-MS), nonionic surfactant, patient CTC-derived xenograft (PCDX), single cells, single-cell proteomics	Large numbers of cells are generally required for quantitative global proteome profiling due to surface adsorption losses associated with sample processing. Such bulk measurement obscures important cell-to-cell variability (cell heterogeneity) and makes proteomic profiling impossible for rare cell populations (e.g., circulating tumor cells (CTCs)). Here we report a surfactant-assisted one-pot sample preparation coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) method termed SOP-MS for label-free global single-cell proteomics. SOP-MS capitalizes on the combination of a MS-compatible nonionic surfactant, n-Dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside, and hydrophobic surface-based low-bind tubes or multi-well plates for 'all-in-one' one-pot sample preparation. This 'all-in-one' method including elimination of all sample transfer steps maximally reduces surface adsorption losses for effective processing of single cells, thus improving detection sensitivity for single-cell proteomics. This method allows convenient label-free quantification of hundreds of proteins from single human cells and ~1200 proteins from small tissue sections (close to ~20 cells). When applied to a patient CTC-derived xenograft (PCDX) model at the single-cell resolution, SOP-MS can reveal distinct protein signatures between primary tumor cells and early metastatic lung cells, which are related to the selection pressure of anti-tumor immunity during breast cancer metastasis. The approach paves the way for routine, precise, quantitative single-cell proteomics.
PXD022182	33650432	Proteomics-Based Approach Reveals the Involvement of SERPINB9 in Recurrent and Relapsed Multiple Myeloma. 	Proteomics-based approach reveals the involvement of SERPINB9 in recurrent and relapsed multiple myeloma	SERPINB9, multiple myeloma, parallel reaction monitoring, recurrence and relapse	Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common hematological malignancy with poorly understood recurrence and relapse mechanisms. Notably, bortezomib resistance leading to relapse makes MM treatment significantly challenging. To clarify the drug resistance mechanism, we employed a quantitative proteomics approach to identify differentially expressed protein candidates implicated in bortezomib-resistant recurrent and relapsed MM (RRMM). Bone marrow aspirates from five patients newly diagnosed with MM (NDMM) were compared with those from five patients diagnosed with bortezomib-resistant RRMM using tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry (TMT-MS). Subcellular localization and functional classification of the differentially expressed proteins were determined by gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, and hierarchical clustering analyses. The top candidates identified were validated with parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis using tissue samples from 11 NDMM and 8 RRMM patients, followed by comparison with the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset of 10 MM patients and 10 healthy controls (accession no.: GSE80608). Thirty-four differentially expressed proteins in RRMM, including proteinase inhibitor 9 (SERPINB9), were identified by TMT-MS. Subsequent functional enrichment analyses of the identified protein candidates indicated their involvement in regulating cellular metabolism, apoptosis, programmed cell death, lymphocyte-mediated immunity, and defense response pathways in RRMM. The top protein candidate SERPINB9 was confirmed by PRM analysis and western blotting as well as by comparison with an NCBI GEO dataset. We elucidated the proteome landscape of bortezomib-resistant RRMM and identified SERPINB9 as a promising novel therapeutic target. Our results provide a resource for future studies on the mechanism of RRMM.
PXD017210	33650774	Integrative analysis of cell state changes in lung fibrosis with peripheral protein biomarkers. 	Predictive protein biomarker signatures and the corresponding transcriptional cell state changes in human lung fibrosis (Plasma)	biomarker, data integration, fibrosis, single cell RNA-seq, systems medicine	The correspondence of cell state changes in diseased organs to peripheral protein signatures is currently unknown. Here, we generated and integrated single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic data from multiple large pulmonary fibrosis patient cohorts. Integration of 233,638 single-cell transcriptomes (n = 61) across three independent cohorts enabled us to derive shifts in cell type proportions and a robust core set of genes altered in lung fibrosis for 45 cell types. Mass spectrometry analysis of lung lavage fluid (n = 124) and plasma (n = 141) proteomes identified distinct protein signatures correlated with diagnosis, lung function, and injury status. A novel SSTR2+ pericyte state correlated with disease severity and was reflected in lavage fluid by increased levels of the complement regulatory factor CFHR1. We further discovered CRTAC1 as a biomarker of alveolar type-2 epithelial cell health status in lavage fluid and plasma. Using cross-modal analysis and machine learning, we identified the cellular source of biomarkers and demonstrated that information transfer between modalities correctly predicts disease status, suggesting feasibility of clinical cell state monitoring through longitudinal sampling of body fluid proteomes.
PXD021889	33650845	Capillary Zone Electrophoresis-Tandem Mass Spectrometry As an Alternative to Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Top-down Proteomics of Histones. 	Capillary zone electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry as an alternative to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for top-down proteomics of histones with the identification of over 1000 histone proteoforms	intact histone proteoforms/mobility prediction/top-down proteomics/ histone postlational modifications/calf histone	Top-down proteomics (TDP) is an ideal approach for deciphering the histone code and it routinely employs reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Because of the extreme complexity of histones regarding the number of proteoforms, new analytical tools with high-capacity separation and highly sensitive detection of proteoforms are required for TDP of histones. Here we present capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)-MS/MS via the electro-kinetically pumped sheath-flow CE-MS interface for large-scale top-down delineation of histone proteoforms. CZE-MS/MS identified a comparable number of proteoforms to RPLC-MS/MS from a calf histone sample with more than 30-fold less sample consumption (75-ng vs. Three mug), indicating its substantially higher sensitivity. We identified about 400 histone proteoforms from the calf histone sample using two-dimensional size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)-CZE-MS/MS with less than 300-ng proteins consumed. We identified histone proteoforms carrying various tentative post-translational modifications (PTMs), for example, acetylation, methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-), phosphorylation, and succinylation. The electrophoretic mobility (muef) of unmodified histone proteoforms can be predicted accurately (R(2) = 0.98) with an optimized semiempirical model based on our recent work. The results render CZE-MS/MS as a useful tool for deciphering the histone code in a proteoform-specific manner and on a global scale.
PXD020036	33651877	Cigarette Smoke Triggers Loss of Corneal Endothelial Cells and Disruption of Descemet's Membrane Proteins in Mice. 	Cigarette smoke induces changes in the basement membrane proteins of the corneal endothelium	Cigarette smoke, Corneal Endothelium, Mass-spectrometry, basement membrane	Purpose: To investigate changes at a molecular level in the mouse corneal endothelium (CE) exposed to chronic cigarette smoke (CS). Methods: Pregnant mice (gestation days 18-20) were placed in a whole-body exposure smoking chamber, and a few days later pups were born. After 3.5 months of CS exposure, a ConfoScan4 scanning microscope was used to examine the corneal endothelial cells (CECs) of CS-exposed and control (Ct) mice. The CE was peeled under a microscope and maintained as four biological replicates (two male and two female) for CS-exposed and Ct mice; each replicate consisted of 16 CEs. The proteome of the CE was investigated through mass spectrometry. Results: The CE images of CS-exposed and Ct mice revealed a difference in the shape of CECs accompanied by a nearly 10% decrease in CEC density (P < 0.00003) following CS exposure. Proteome profiling identified a total of 524 proteins exhibiting statistically significant changes in CE from CS-exposed mice. Importantly, proteins associated with Descemet's membrane (DM), including COL4alpha1, COL4alpha2, COL4alpha3, COL4alpha4, COL4alpha5, COL4alpha6, COL8alpha1, COL8alpha2, and FN1, among others, exhibited diminished protein levels in the CE of CS-exposed mice. Conclusions: Our data confirm that exposure to CS results in reduced CEC density accompanied by diminished levels of multiple collagen and extracellular matrix proteins associated with DM.
PXD023277	33655243	The proximal proteome of 17 SARS-CoV-2 proteins links to disrupted antiviral signaling and host translation. 	The host  targets of SARS-CoV-2 protein NSP5	Covid-19, NSP5, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, Proximity labeling, SILAC, Sars-cov-2	Viral proteins localize within subcellular compartments to subvert host machinery and promote pathogenesis. To study SARS-CoV-2 biology, we generated an atlas of 2422 human proteins vicinal to 17 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins using proximity proteomics. This identified viral proteins at specific intracellular locations, such as association of accessary proteins with intracellular membranes, and projected SARS-CoV-2 impacts on innate immune signaling, ER-Golgi transport, and protein translation. It identified viral protein adjacency to specific host proteins whose regulatory variants are linked to COVID-19 severity, including the TRIM4 interferon signaling regulator which was found proximal to the SARS-CoV-2 M protein. Viral NSP1 protein adjacency to the EIF3 complex was associated with inhibited host protein translation whereas ORF6 localization with MAVS was associated with inhibited RIG-I 2CARD-mediated IFNB1 promoter activation. Quantitative proteomics identified candidate host targets for the NSP5 protease, with specific functional cleavage sequences in host proteins CWC22 and FANCD2. This data resource identifies host factors proximal to viral proteins in living human cells and nominates pathogenic mechanisms employed by SARS-CoV-2. AUTHOR SUMMARY: SARS-CoV-2 is the latest pathogenic coronavirus to emerge as a public health threat. We create a database of proximal host proteins to 17 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. We validate that NSP1 is proximal to the EIF3 translation initiation complex and is a potent inhibitor of translation. We also identify ORF6 antagonism of RNA-mediate innate immune signaling. We produce a database of potential host targets of the viral protease NSP5, and create a fluorescence-based assay to screen cleavage of peptide sequences. We believe that this data will be useful for identifying roles for many of the uncharacterized SARS-CoV-2 proteins and provide insights into the pathogenicity of new or emerging coronaviruses.
PXD012453	33656060	Integrated analysis of label-free quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics reveal insights into signaling pathways in male breast cancer. 	Integrated analysis of label-free quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics reveal insights into signaling pathways in male breast cancer	Male breast cancer, bioinformatics analysis, label-free mass spectrometry, signaling pathways	Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare malignancy that accounts for about 1.8% of all breast cancer cases. In contrast to the high number of the "omics" studies in breast cancer in women, only recently molecular approaches have been performed in MBC research. High-throughput proteomics based methodologies are promisor strategies to characterize the MBC proteomic signatures and their association with clinico-pathological parameters. In this study, the label-free quantification-mass spectrometry and bioinformatics approaches were applied to analyze the proteomic profiling of a MBC case using the primary breast tumor and the corresponding axillary metastatic lymph nodes and adjacent non-tumor breast tissues. The differentially expressed proteins were identified in the signaling pathways of granzyme B, sirtuins, eIF2, actin cytoskeleton, eNOS, acute phase response and calcium and were connected to the upstream regulators MYC, PI3K SMARCA4 and cancer-related chemical drugs. An additional proteomic comparative analysis was performed with a primary breast tumor of a female patient and revealed an interesting set of proteins, which were mainly involved in cancer biology. Together, our data provide a relevant data source for the MBC research that can help the therapeutic strategies for its management.
PXD022236	33656888	In Stallion Spermatozoa, Superoxide Dismutase (Cu-Zn) (SOD1) and the Aldo-Keto-Reductase Family 1 Member b (AKR1B1) Are the Proteins Most Significantly Reduced by Cryopreservation. 	STALLION SPERM PROTEINS AFTER CRYOPRESERVATION	cryopreservation, horse, spermatozoa	Although cryopreservation is widely used in animal breeding, the technique is still suboptimal. The population of spermatozoa surviving the procedure experiences changes attributed to alteration in their redox regulation. In order to expand our knowledge regarding this particular aspect, the proteome in fresh and frozen thawed aliquots of equine spermatozoa was studied to identify the proteins most severely affected by the procedure. If alteration of redox regulation is a major factor explaining cryodamage, proteins participating in redox regulation should be principally affected. Using a split sample design, 30 ejaculates from 10 different stallions were analyzed as fresh spermatozoa, and another aliquot from the same ejaculate was analyzed as a frozen thawed sample. The proteome was studied under both conditions using UHPLC-MS/MS and bioinformatic analysis conducted to identify discriminant variables between both conditions. Data are available through the ProteomeXchange Consortium with identifier PXD022236. The proteins most significantly reduced were Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B (p = 2.2 x 10(-17)) and Superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn) (p = 4.7 x 10(-14)). This is the first time that SOD1 has been identified as a discriminating variable using bioinformatic analysis, where it was one of the most highly significantly different proteins seen between fresh and frozen thawed semen. This finding strongly supports the theory that alteration in redox regulation and oxidative stress is a major factor involved in cryodamage and suggests that control of redox regulation should be a major target to improve current cryopreservation procedures.
PXD022267	33657400	Complex-dependent histone acetyltransferase activity of KAT8 determines its role in transcription and cellular homeostasis. 	Complex-dependent histone acetyltransferase activity of KAT8 determines its role in transcriptional regulation and cellular homeostasis [AP-MS]	KAT8, MSL, NSL, histone	Acetylation of lysine 16 on histone H4 (H4K16ac) is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferase KAT8 and can prevent chromatin compaction in vitro. Although extensively studied in Drosophila, the functions of H4K16ac and two KAT8-containing protein complexes (NSL and MSL) are not well understood in mammals. Here, we demonstrate a surprising complex-dependent activity of KAT8: it catalyzes H4K5ac and H4K8ac as part of the NSL complex, whereas it catalyzes the bulk of H4K16ac as part of the MSL complex. Furthermore, we show that MSL complex proteins and H4K16ac are not required for cell proliferation and chromatin accessibility, whereas the NSL complex is essential for cell survival, as it stimulates transcription initiation at the promoters of housekeeping genes. In summary, we show that KAT8 switches catalytic activity and function depending on its associated proteins and that, when in the NSL complex, it catalyzes H4K5ac and H4K8ac required for the expression of essential genes.

RawBeans: a simple, vendor independent, raw-data quality control tool	QC, Quality Control	Every laboratory performing mass-spectrometry-based proteomics strives to generate high-quality data. Among the many factors that impact the outcome of any experiment in proteomics is the LC-MS system performance, which should be monitored within each specific experiment and also long term. This process is termed quality control (QC). We present an easy-to-use tool that rapidly produces a visual, HTML-based report that includes the key parameters needed to monitor the LC-MS system performance, with a focus on monitoring the performance within an experiment.

PXD019291	33658224	An L-type lectin receptor-like kinase promotes starch accumulation during rice pollen maturation. 	ABNORMAL POLLEN 1 (AP1) encodes a legume-type lectin receptor-like kinase and is involved in starch accumulation during rice pollen maturation	AP1, Phosphorylation, Pollen, Protein interaction, Rice, Starch	Starch accumulation is key for the maturity of rice pollen grains; however, the regulatory mechanism underlying this process remains unknown. Here, we have isolated a male-sterile rice mutant, abnormal pollen 1 (ap1), which produces nonviable pollen grains with defective starch accumulation. Functional analysis revealed that AP1 encodes an active L-type lectin receptor-like kinase (L-LecRLK). AP1 is localized to the plasma membrane and its transcript is highly accumulated in pollen during the starch synthesis phase. RNA-seq and phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that the expression/phosphorylation levels of numerous genes/proteins involved in starch and sucrose metabolism pathway were significantly altered in the mutant pollen, including a known rice UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (OsUGP2). We further found that AP1 physically interacts with OsUGP2 to elevate its enzymatic activity, likely through targeted phosphorylation. These findings revealed a novel role of L-LecRLK in controlling pollen maturity via modulating sucrose and starch metabolism.
PXD022080	33659004	Novel Secreted Protein of Mycoplasma bovis MbovP280 Induces Macrophage Apoptosis Through CRYAB. 	The MbovP280 of mycoplasma bovis immunoprecipitates with the wole cell lysates of bovine macrophage (BoMac),and then LC-MS/MS was used to identify the MbovP280-binding ligands	BoMac, Bovine, IP, MbovP280, Mycoplasma bovis	Mycoplasma bovis causes important diseases and great losses on feedlots and dairy farms. However, there are only a few measures to control M. bovis-related diseases. As in other mycoplasma species, this is predominantly because the virulence related factors of this pathogen are largely unknown. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify novel virulence-related factors among the secreted proteins of M. bovis. Using bioinformatic tools to analyze its secreted proteins, we preliminarily predicted 39 secreted lipoproteins, and then selected 11 of them for confirmation based on SignalP scores >0.6 or SceP scores >0.8 and conserved domains. These 11 genes were cloned after gene modification based on the codon bias of Escherichia coli and expressed. Mouse antiserum to each recombinant protein was developed. A western blotting assay with these antisera confirmed that MbovP280 and MbovP475 are strongly expressed and secreted proteins, but only MbovP280 significantly reduced the viability of bovine macrophages (BoMac). In further experiments, MbovP280 induced the apoptosis of BoMac treated with both live M. bovis and MbovP280 protein. The conserved coiled-coil domain of MbovP280 at amino acids 210-269 is essential for its induction of apoptosis. Further, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and coimmunoprecipitation assays identified the anti-apoptosis regulator alphaB-crystallin (CRYAB) as an MbovP280-binding ligand. An alphabeta-crystallin knockout cell line BoMac-cryab(-), Mbov0280-knockout M. bovis strain T9.297, and its complemented M. bovis strain CT9.297 were constructed and the apoptosis of BoMac-cryab(-) induced by these strains was compared. The results confirmed that CRYAB is critical for MbovP280 function as an apoptosis inducer in BoMac. In conclusion, in this study, we identified MbovP280 as a novel secreted protein of M. bovis that induces the apoptosis of BoMac via its coiled-coil domain and cellular ligand CRYAB. These findings extend our understanding of the virulence mechanism of mycoplasmal species.
PXD015697	33659721	Allergenicity assessment of Delonix regia pollen grain and identification of allergens by immunoproteomic approach. 	MALDI TOF/TOF of Delonix regia pollen protein	Delonix, pollen, protein	BACKGROUND: Plantation of road-side avenue trees has become a major part of urbanization programme for megacity beautification and environmental management. Due to evergreen habit and vibrant flower colour, Delonix regia (Gulmohor/Flamboyant) is frequently selected as ornamental tree for plantation programme. However, D. regia pollen is related to IgE mediated allergic reactions and no allergen has been reported so far. OBJECTIVE: Measuring the prevalence of D. regia pollen sensitivity among the local atopic individuals and identifying the allergens using immunoproteomic tools. METHODS: Aerobiological study was conducted for a period of two years to record the D. regia pollen concentration in the outdoor ambient air. Clinico-immunological tests were performed on atopic individuals to check the prevalence of sensitivity against D. regia pollen. Allergens were detected in the pollen proteome, fractionated in 1D and 2D gel by IgE serology and finally identified by mass spectrometry. RESULT: In the study area D. regia pollen grains were present in ample amount in the air during May to July. About 38% of atopic individuals displayed positive Skin Prick Test (SPT) against D. regia pollen along with elevated level of specific IgE and histamine in the sera. Immunoproteomic analyses revealed the presence of 14 IgE reactive proteins in the 2D pollen proteome, of which 8 IgE reactive proteins were identified by MALDI TOF/TOF using homology driven proteomic approach. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated pollen related allergy symptoms by D. regia and gave significant message regarding the plantation programme to avoid the unnecessary load of allergic pollen. Also, a panel of 8 allergens were identified for the first time from D. regia pollen. Detailed study of these allergens would help to design immunotherapeutic strategies for pollinosis management.
PXD019428	33660780	Disruption of exon-bridging interactions between the minor and major spliceosomes results in alternative splicing around minor introns. 	Identification of interacting proteins of Pdcd7 (U11-59K)	Pdcd7	Vertebrate genomes contain major (>99.5%) and minor (<0.5%) introns that are spliced by the major and minor spliceosomes, respectively. Major intron splicing follows the exon-definition model, whereby major spliceosome components first assemble across exons. However, since most genes with minor introns predominately consist of major introns, formation of exon-definition complexes in these genes would require interaction between the major and minor spliceosomes. Here, we report that minor spliceosome protein U11-59K binds to the major spliceosome U2AF complex, thereby supporting a model in which the minor spliceosome interacts with the major spliceosome across an exon to regulate the splicing of minor introns. Inhibition of minor spliceosome snRNAs and U11-59K disrupted exon-bridging interactions, leading to exon skipping by the major spliceosome. The resulting aberrant isoforms contained a premature stop codon, yet were not subjected to nonsense-mediated decay, but rather bound to polysomes. Importantly, we detected elevated levels of these alternatively spliced transcripts in individuals with minor spliceosome-related diseases such as Roifman syndrome, Lowry-Wood syndrome and early-onset cerebellar ataxia. In all, we report that the minor spliceosome informs splicing by the major spliceosome through exon-definition interactions and show that minor spliceosome inhibition results in aberrant alternative splicing in disease.
PXD013286	33660784	Defining a novel domain that provides an essential contribution to site-specific interaction of Rep protein with DNA. 	A novel domain essential for interdomain cooperativity in binding of a Rep protein to DNA.	DNA binding domain, DNA replication initiation, Rep proteins, TrfA, Winged Helix Domain, plasmid RK2	An essential feature of replication initiation proteins is their ability to bind to DNA. In this work, we describe a new domain that contributes to a replication initiator sequence-specific interaction with DNA. Applying biochemical assays and structure prediction methods coupled with DNA-protein crosslinking, mass spectrometry, and construction and analysis of mutant proteins, we identified that the replication initiator of the broad host range plasmid RK2, in addition to two winged helix domains, contains a third DNA-binding domain. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the composition of this unique domain is typical within the described TrfA-like protein family. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments involving the constructed TrfA mutant proteins showed that the newly identified domain is essential for the formation of the protein complex with DNA, contributes to the avidity for interaction with DNA, and the replication activity of the initiator. The analysis of mutant proteins, each containing a single substitution, showed that each of the three domains composing TrfA is essential for the formation of the protein complex with DNA. Furthermore, the new domain, along with the winged helix domains, contributes to the sequence specificity of replication initiator interaction within the plasmid replication origin.
PXD022121	33660978	Tyrosine-Reactive Cross-Linker for Probing Protein Three-Dimensional Structures. 	A Tyrosine Reactive Cross-Linker for Probing Protein 3D Structures	Cross-linking mass spectrometry, Tyrosine	Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has made significant progress in understanding the structure of protein and elucidating architectures of larger protein complexes. Current XL-MS applications are limited to targeting lysine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and cysteine residues. There remains a need for the development of novel cross-linkers enabling selective targeting of other amino acid residues in proteins. Here, a novel simple cross-linker, namely, [4,4'-(disulfanediylbis(ethane-2,1-diyl)) bis(1,2,4-triazolidine-3,5-dione)] (DBB), has been designed, synthesized, and characterized. This cross-linker can react selectively with tyrosine residues in protein through the electrochemical click reaction. The DBB cross-links produced the characteristic peptides before and after electrochemical reduction, thus permitting the simplified data analysis and accurate identification for the cross-linked products. This is the first time a cross-linker is developed for targeting tyrosine residues on protein without using photoirradiation or a metal catalyst. This strategy might potentially be used as a complementary tool for XL-MS to probe protein 3D structures, protein complexes, and protein-protein interaction.
PXD021132	33661099	Disease-related mutations in PI3Kgamma disrupt regulatory C-terminal dynamics and reveal a path to selective inhibitors. 	Targeting of disease-linked mutations in PI3K gamma	HDX-MS, PI3K, PI3K gamma, inhibitor, kinase assay, molecular dynamics	Class I Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are master regulators of cellular functions, with the class IB PI3K catalytic subunit (p110gamma) playing key roles in immune signalling. p110gamma is a key factor in inflammatory diseases and has been identified as a therapeutic target for cancers due to its immunomodulatory role. Using a combined biochemical/biophysical approach, we have revealed insight into regulation of kinase activity, specifically defining how immunodeficiency and oncogenic mutations of R1021 in the C-terminus can inactivate or activate enzyme activity. Screening of inhibitors using HDX-MS revealed that activation loop-binding inhibitors induce allosteric conformational changes that mimic those in the R1021C mutant. Structural analysis of advanced PI3K inhibitors in clinical development revealed novel binding pockets that can be exploited for further therapeutic development. Overall, this work provides unique insights into regulatory mechanisms that control PI3Kgamma kinase activity and shows a framework for the design of PI3K isoform and mutant selective inhibitors.
PXD023988	33661579	Pannexin-1 channel regulates nuclear content packaging into apoptotic bodies and their size. 	PANNEXIN-1 CHANNEL REGULATES NUCLEAR CONTENT PACKAGING INTO APOPTOTIC BODIES AND THEIR SIZE	Apoptotic bodies, DNA, cargo sorting, extracellular vesicles, nuclear proteins, pannexin 1	Apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs), which are large extracellular vesicles exclusively released by apoptotic cells, possess therapeutically exploitable properties including biomolecule loadability and transferability. However, current limited understanding of ApoBD biology has hindered its exploration for clinical use. Particularly, as ApoBD-accompanying cargoes (e.g., nucleic acids and proteins) have major influence on their functionality, further insights into the mechanism of biomolecule sorting into ApoBDs are critical to unleash their therapeutic potential. Previous studies suggested pannexin 1 (PANX1) channel, a negative regulator of ApoBD biogenesis, can modify synaptic vesicle contents. We also reported that trovafloxacin (a PANX1 inhibitor) increases proportion of ApoBDs containing DNA. Therefore, we sought to define the role of PANX1 in regulating the sorting of nuclear content into ApoBDs. Here, using flow cytometry and label-free quantitative proteomic analyses, we showed that targeting PANX1 activity during apoptosis, via either pharmacological inhibition or genetic disruption, resulted in enrichment of both DNA and nuclear proteins in ApoBDs that were unexpectedly smaller in size. Our data suggest that PANX1, besides being a key regulator of ApoBD formation, also functions as a negative regulator of nuclear content packaging and modulator of ApoBD size. Together, our findings provide further insights into ApoBD biology and form a novel conceptual framework for ApoBD-based therapies through pharmacologically manipulating ApoBD contents.
PXD009493	33661639	Using Heavy Mass Isotopomers for Protein Turnover in Heavy Water Metabolic Labeling. 	D2Ome - rate constant estimation from heavy water metabolic labeling and LC-MS	Heavy water labeling, Protein turnover, Software	Metabolic labeling followed by LC-MS-based proteomics is a powerful tool to study proteome dynamics in high-throughput experiments both in vivo and in vitro. High mass resolution and accuracy allow differentiation in isotope profiles and the quantification of partially labeled peptide species. Metabolic labeling duration introduces a time domain in which the gradual incorporation of labeled isotopes is recorded. Different stable isotopes are used for labeling. Labeling with heavy water has advantages because it is cost-effective and easy to use. The protein degradation rate constant has been modeled using exponential decay models for the relative abundances of mass isotopomers. The recently developed closed-form equations were applied to study the analytic behavior of the heavy mass isotopomers in the time domain of metabolic labeling. The predictions from the closed-form equations are compared with the practices that have been used to extract degradation rate constants from the time-course profiles of heavy mass isotopomers. It is shown that all mass isotopomers, except for the monoisotope, require data transformations to obtain the exponential depletion, which serves as a basis for the rate constant model. Heavy mass isotopomers may be preferable choices for modeling high-mass peptides or peptides with a high number of labeling sites. The results are also applicable to stable isotope labeling with other atom-based labeling agents.
PXD018074	33661642	Peak Identification and Quantification by Proteomic Mass Spectrogram Decomposition. 	One-dimensional capillary liquid chromatographic separation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry unveils the Escherichia coli proteome on a microarray scale.	E. coli	Recent advances in the liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) technology have improved the sensitivity, resolution, and speed of proteome analysis, resulting in increasing demand for more sophisticated algorithms to interpret complex mass spectrograms. Here, we propose a novel statistical method, proteomic mass spectrogram decomposition (ProtMSD), for joint identification and quantification of peptides and proteins. Given the proteomic mass spectrogram and the reference mass spectra of all possible peptide ions associated with proteins as a dictionary, ProtMSD estimates the chromatograms of those peptide ions under a group sparsity constraint without using the conventional careful preprocessing (e.g., thresholding and peak picking). We show that the method was significantly improved using protein-peptide hierarchical relationships, isotopic distribution profiles, reference retention times of peptide ions, and prelearned mass spectra of noise. We examined the concept of database search, library search, and match-between-runs. Our ProtMSD showed excellent agreements of 3277 peptide ions (94.79%) and 493 proteins (98.21%) with Mascot/Skyline for an Escherichia coli proteome sample and of 4460 peptide ions (103%) and 588 proteins (101%) with match-between-runs by MaxQuant for a yeast proteome sample. This is the first attempt to use a matrix decomposition technique as a tool for LC/MS-based proteome identification and quantification.
PXD015527	33662623	Integrative Proteomic Analysis of Multiple Posttranslational Modifications in Inflammatory Response. 	Integrative proteomics of macrophage in response to LPS stimulation	acetylome, inflammation, phosphoproteome, ubiquitinome	Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, particularly acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, play critical roles in the host innate immune response. PTMs' dynamic changes and the crosstalk among them are complicated. To build a comprehensive dynamic network of inflammation-related proteins, we integrated data from the whole-cell proteome (WCP), acetylome, phosphoproteome, and ubiquitinome of human and mouse macrophages. Our datasets of acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination sites helped identify PTM crosstalk within and across proteins involved in the inflammatory response. Stimulation of macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in both degradative and non-degradative ubiquitination. Moreover, this study contributes to the interpretation of the roles of known inflammatory molecules and the discovery of novel inflammatory proteins.
PXD019538	33664260	The methyltransferase SETD2 couples transcription and splicing by engaging mRNA processing factors through its SHI domain. 	The histone methyltransferase SETD2 couples transcription and splicing by engaging pre-mRNA processing factors through its SHI domain	chromatin, complex, domain, hnRNP, mediator	Heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are RNA binding molecules that are involved in key processes such as RNA splicing and transcription. One such hnRNP protein, hnRNP L, regulates alternative splicing (AS) by binding to pre-mRNA transcripts. However, it is unclear what factors contribute to hnRNP L-regulated AS events. Using proteomic approaches, we identified several key factors that co-purify with hnRNP L. We demonstrate that one such factor, the histone methyltransferase SETD2, specifically interacts with hnRNP L in vitro and in vivo. This interaction occurs through a previously uncharacterized domain in SETD2, the SETD2-hnRNP Interaction (SHI) domain, the deletion of which, leads to a reduced H3K36me3 deposition. Functionally, SETD2 regulates a subset of hnRNP L-targeted AS events. Our findings demonstrate that SETD2, by interacting with Pol II as well as hnRNP L, can mediate the crosstalk between the transcription and the splicing machinery.
PXD023377	33664368	Integrative network analysis reveals USP7 haploinsufficiency inhibits E-protein activity in pediatric T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). 	Integrative Network Analysis Reveals USP7 Haploinsufficiency Inhibits E-protein Activity in Pediatric T-lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL)	T-ALL, TAL1, USP7	USP7, which encodes a deubiquitylating enzyme, is among the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric T-ALL, with somatic heterozygous loss-of-function mutations (haploinsufficiency) predominantly affecting the subgroup that has aberrant TAL1 oncogene activation. Network analysis of > 200 T-ALL transcriptomes linked USP7 haploinsufficiency with decreased activities of E-proteins. E-proteins are also negatively regulated by TAL1, leading to concerted down-regulation of E-protein target genes involved in T-cell development. In T-ALL cell lines, we showed the physical interaction of USP7 with E-proteins and TAL1 by mass spectrometry and ChIP-seq. Haploinsufficient but not complete CRISPR knock-out of USP7 showed accelerated cell growth and validated transcriptional down-regulation of E-protein targets. Our study unveiled the synergistic effect of USP7 haploinsufficiency with aberrant TAL1 activation on T-ALL, implicating USP7 as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in T-ALL. Our findings caution against a universal oncogene designation for USP7 while emphasizing the dosage-dependent consequences of USP7 inhibitors currently under development as potential cancer therapeutics.
PXD021097	33666082	Ubiquitin-Modified Proteome of SARS-CoV-2-Infected Host Cells Reveals Insights into Virus-Host Interaction and Pathogenesis. 	The Ubiquitin-modified Proteome of SARS-CoV-2-infected Host Cells Reveals Insights into Virus-Host Interaction and Pathogenesis	Covid-19, LC-MS, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, coronavirus disease 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, ubiquitome	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed a serious threat to global public health. The mechanism of pathogenesis and the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are largely unknown. In the present study, we applied a quantitative proteomic technology to identify and quantify the ubiquitination changes that occur in both the virus and the Vero E6 cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. By applying label-free, quantitative liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry proteomics, 8943 lysine ubiquitination sites on 3086 proteins were identified, of which 138 sites on 104 proteins were quantified as significantly upregulated, while 828 sites on 447 proteins were downregulated at 72 h post-infection. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection might modulate host immune responses through the ubiquitination of important proteins, including USP5, IQGAP1, TRIM28, and Hsp90. Ubiquitination modification was also observed on 11 SAR-CoV-2 proteins, including proteins involved in virus replication and inhibition of the host innate immune response. Our study provides new insights into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the host as well as potential targets for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
PXD023688	33667410	Regulation of the endocytosis and prion-chaperoning machineries by yeast E3 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 as revealed by orthogonal ubiquitin transfer. 	Regulation of the Endocytosis and Prion Chaperoning Machineries by Yeast E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Rsp5 as Revealed by Orthogonal Ubiquitin Transfer	Ubiquitin	Attachment of the ubiquitin (UB) peptide to proteins via the E1-E2-E3 enzymatic machinery regulates diverse biological pathways, yet identification of the substrates of E3 UB ligases remains a challenge. We overcame this challenge by constructing an "orthogonal UB transfer" (OUT) cascade with yeast E3 Rsp5 to enable the exclusive delivery of an engineered UB (xUB) to Rsp5 and its substrate proteins. The OUT screen uncovered new Rsp5 substrates in yeast, such as Pal1 and Pal2, which are partners of endocytic protein Ede1, and chaperones Hsp70-Ssb, Hsp82, and Hsp104 that counteract protein misfolding and control self-perpetuating amyloid aggregates (prions), resembling those involved in human amyloid diseases. We showed that prion formation and effect of Hsp104 on prion propagation are modulated by Rsp5. Overall, our work demonstrates the capacity of OUT to deconvolute the complex E3-substrate relationships in crucial biological processes such as endocytosis and protein assembly disorders through protein ubiquitination.
PXD023678	33668237	Major Determinants of Airway Epithelial Cell Sensitivity to S. aureus Alpha-Toxin: Disposal of Toxin Heptamers by Extracellular Vesicle Formation and Lysosomal Degradation. 	Major determinants of airway epithelial cell sensitivity to S. aureus alpha-toxin:  Disposition of toxin heptamers by extracellular vesicle formation and lysosomal degradation	Staphylococcus aureus, airway epithelial cells, alpha-toxin, cellular sensitivity, transmembrane pores, virulence factors	Alpha-toxin is a major virulence factor of Staphylococcus aureus. Monomer binding to host cell membranes results in the formation of heptameric transmembrane pores. Among human model airway epithelial cell lines, A549 cells were most sensitive toward the toxin followed by 16HBE14o(-) and S9 cells. In this study we investigated the processes of internalization of pore-containing plasma membrane areas as well as potential pathways for heptamer degradation (lysosomal, proteasomal) or disposal (formation of exosomes/micro-vesicles). The abundance of toxin heptamers upon applying an alpha-toxin pulse to the cells declined both in extracts of whole cells and of cellular membranes of S9 cells, but not in those of 16HBE14o(-) or A549 cells. Comparisons of heptamer degradation rates under inhibition of lysosomal or proteasomal degradation revealed that an important route of heptamer degradation, at least in S9 cells, seems to be the lysosomal pathway, while proteasomal degradation appears to be irrelevant. Exosomes prepared from culture supernatants of toxin-exposed S9 cells contained alpha-toxin as well as low amounts of exosome and micro-vesicle markers. These results indicate that lysosomal degradation of internalized toxin heptamers may be the most important determinant of toxin-resistance of some types of airway epithelial cells.
PXD022178	33668324	FOXC1 Downregulates Nanog Expression by Recruiting HDAC2 to Its Promoter in F9 Cells Treated by Retinoic Acid. 	Proteomic Analysis of Foxc1-interacting proteins in HEK293T cells	Foxc1	FOXC1, a transcription factor involved in cell differentiation and embryogenesis, is demonstrated to be a negative regulator of Nanog in this study. FOXC1 is up-regulated in retinoic acid-induced differentiation of F9 Embryonal Carcinoma (EC) cells; furthermore, FOXC1 specifically inhibits the core pluripotency factor Nanog by binding to the proximal promoter. Overexpression of FOXC1 in F9 or knockdown in 3T3 results in the down-regulation or up-regulation of Nanog mRNA and proteins, respectively. In order to explain the mechanism by which FOXC1 inhibits Nanog expression, we identified the co-repressor HDAC2 from the FOXC1 interactome. FOXC1 recruits HDAC2 to Nanog promoter to decrease H3K27ac enrichment, resulting in transcription inhibition of Nanog. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that FOXC1 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.
PXD020739	33668817	Cannabis Use Induces Distinctive Proteomic Alterations in Olfactory Neuroepithelial Cells of Schizophrenia Patients. 	Olfactory neuroepithelial proteome in Schizophrenia & cannabis	olfactory neuroepithelium	A close epidemiological link has been reported between cannabis use and schizophrenia (SCZ). However, biochemical markers in living humans related to the impact of cannabis in this disease are still missing. Olfactory neuroepithelium (ON) cells express neural features and offer a unique advantage to study biomarkers of psychiatric diseases. The aim of our study was to find exclusively deregulated proteins in ON cells of SCZ patients with and without a history of cannabis use. Thus, we compared the proteomic profiles of SCZ non-cannabis users (SCZ/nc) and SCZ cannabis users (SCZ/c) with control subjects non-cannabis users (C/nc) and control cannabis users (C/c). The results revealed that the main cascades affected in SCZ/nc were cell cycle, DNA replication, signal transduction and protein localization. Conversely, cannabis use in SCZ patients induced specific alterations in metabolism of RNA and metabolism of proteins. The levels of targeted proteins in each population were then correlated with cognitive performance and clinical scores. In SCZ/c, the expression levels of 2 proteins involved in the metabolism of RNA (MTREX and ZNF326) correlated with several cognitive markers and clinical signs. Moreover, use duration of cannabis negatively correlated with ZNF326 expression. These findings indicate that RNA-related proteins might be relevant to understand the influence of cannabis use on SCZ.
PXD020213	33670077	Glucose-Binding of Periplasmic Protein GltB Activates GtrS-GltR Two-Component System in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 	Identification of GltB-interacting proteins by CoIP-MS	GltB-interacting protein, pseudomonas aeruginosa	A two-component system GtrS-GltR is required for glucose transport activity in P. aeruginosa and plays a key role during P. aeruginosa-host interactions. However, the mechanism of action of GtrS-GltR has not been definitively established. Here, we show that gltB, which encodes a periplasmic glucose binding protein, is essential for the glucose-induced activation of GtrS-GltR in P. aeruginosa. We determined that GltB is capable of binding to membrane regulatory proteins including GtrS, the sensor kinase of the GtrS-GltR TCS. We observed that alanine substitution of glucose-binding residues abolishes the ability of GltB to promote the activation of GtrS-GltR. Importantly, like the gtrS deletion mutant, gltB deletion mutant showed attenuated virulence in both Drosophila melanogaster and mouse models of infection. In addition, using CHIP-seq experiments, we showed that the promoter of gltB is the major in vivo target of GltR. Collectively, these data suggest that periplasmic binding protein GltB and GtrS-GltR TCS form a complex regulatory circuit that regulates the virulence of P. aeruginosa in response to glucose.
PXD019813	33671144	Mycobacterium tuberculosis Small RNA MTS1338 Confers Pathogenic Properties to Non-Pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis. 	Micobacterium smegmatis LC-MS/MS	Micobacterium smegmatis	Small non-coding RNAs play a key role in bacterial adaptation to various stresses. Mycobacterium tuberculosis small RNA MTS1338 is upregulated during mycobacteria infection of macrophages, suggesting its involvement in the interaction of the pathogen with the host. In this study, we explored the functional effects of MTS1338 by expressing it in non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis that lacks the MTS1338 gene. The results indicated that MTS1338 slowed the growth of the recombinant mycobacteria in culture and increased their survival in RAW 264.7 macrophages, where the MTS1338-expressing strain significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the number of mature phagolysosomes and changed the production of cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-beta, and TNF-alpha compared to those of the control strain. Proteomic and secretomic profiling of recombinant and control strains revealed differential expression of proteins involved in the synthesis of main cell wall components and in the regulation of iron metabolism (ESX-3 secretion system) and response to hypoxia (furA, whiB4, phoP). These effects of MTS1338 expression are characteristic for M. tuberculosis during infection, suggesting that in pathogenic mycobacteria MTS1338 plays the role of a virulence factor supporting the residence of M. tuberculosis in the host.
PXD018903	33672268	IQGAP1 Is a Scaffold of the Core Proteins of the Hippo Pathway and Negatively Regulates the Pro-Apoptotic Signal Mediated by This Pathway. 	phospho-proteomic data on the LATS1 interactome from cells treated with two proapoptotic signals: FAS and etoposide	HeLa, LATS1	The Hippo pathway regulates a complex signalling network which mediates several biological functions including cell proliferation, organ size and apoptosis. Several scaffold proteins regulate the crosstalk of the members of the pathway with other signalling pathways and play an important role in the diverse output controlled by this pathway. In this study we have identified the scaffold protein IQGAP1 as a novel interactor of the core kinases of the Hippo pathway, MST2 and LATS1. Our results indicate that IQGAP1 scaffolds MST2 and LATS1 supresses their kinase activity and YAP1-dependent transcription. Additionally, we show that IQGAP1 is a negative regulator of the non-canonical pro-apoptotic pathway and may enable the crosstalk between this pathway and the ERK and AKT signalling modules. Our data also show that bile acids regulate the IQGAP1-MST2-LATS1 signalling module in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which could be necessary for the inhibition of MST2-dependent apoptosis and hepatocyte transformation.
PXD022733	33672863	Proteomic Analysis of Low-Grade, Early-Stage Endometrial Carcinoma Reveals New Dysregulated Pathways Associated with Cell Death and Cell Signaling. 	Proteomic Analysis Of Low-Grade, Early-Stage Endometrial Carcinoma	Endometrial cancer, TMT	Low-grade, early-stage endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most frequent malignant tumor of the uterine corpus. However, the molecular alterations that underlie these tumors are far from being fully understood. The purpose of this study is to describe dysregulated molecular pathways from EC patients. Sixteen samples of tumor tissue and paired healthy controls were collected and both were subjected to mass spectrometry (MS)/MS proteomic analysis. Gene ontology and pathway analysis was performed to discover dysregulated pathways and/or proteins using different databases and bioinformatic tools. Dysregulated pathways were cross-validated in an independent external cohort. Cell signaling, immune response, and cell death-associated pathways were robustly identified. The SLIT/ROBO signaling pathway demonstrated dysregulation at the proteomic and transcriptomic level. Necroptosis and ferroptosis were cell death-associated processes aberrantly regulated, in addition to apoptosis. Immune response-associated pathways showed a dominance of innate immune responses. Tumor immune infiltrates measured by immunofluorescence demonstrated diverse lymphoid and myeloid populations. Our results suggest a role of SLIT/ROBO, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, as well as a prominent role of innate immune response in low-grade, early-stage EC. These results could guide future research in this group of tumors.
PXD023249	33673118	Chitin Degradation Machinery and Secondary Metabolite Profiles in the Marine Bacterium Pseudoalteromonas rubra S4059. 	Chitin degradation machinery and secondary metabolite profiles in the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas rubra S4059	LC-MS, marine bacteria, secretome	Genome mining of pigmented Pseudoalteromonas has revealed a large potential for the production of bioactive compounds and hydrolytic enzymes. The purpose of the present study was to explore this bioactivity potential in a potent antibiotic and enzyme producer, Pseudoalteromonas rubra strain S4059. Proteomic analyses (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD023249) indicated that a highly efficient chitin degradation machinery was present in the red-pigmented P. rubra S4059 when grown on chitin. Four GH18 chitinases and two GH20 hexosaminidases were significantly upregulated under these conditions. GH19 chitinases, which are not common in bacteria, are consistently found in pigmented Pseudoalteromonas, and in S4059, GH19 was only detected when the bacterium was grown on chitin. To explore the possible role of GH19 in pigmented Pseudoalteromonas, we developed a protocol for genetic manipulation of S4059 and deleted the GH19 chitinase, and compared phenotypes of the mutant and wild type. However, none of the chitin degrading ability, secondary metabolite profile, or biofilm-forming capacity was affected by GH19 deletion. In conclusion, we developed a genetic manipulation protocol that can be used to unravel the bioactive potential of pigmented pseudoalteromonads. An efficient chitinolytic enzyme cocktail was identified in S4059, suggesting that this strain could be a candidate with industrial potential.
PXD018912	33673241	Changes of the Proteome and Acetylome during Transition into the Stationary Phase in the Organohalide-Respiring Dehalococcoides mccartyi Strain CBDB1. 	Growth Phase-Specific Variations of the Proteome and Acetylome of the Organohalide-Respiring Dehalococcoides mccartyi Strain CBDB1	Dehalococcoides mccartyi, Nepsilon-lysine acetylation, Tat transport, acetate metabolism, acetylome, anaerobic respiration, chlorobenzene, growth phase, low biomass, organohalide respiration, reductive dehalogenation, transcription analysis	The strictly anaerobic bactGIerium Dehalococcoides mccartyi obligatorily depends on organohalide respiration for energy conservation and growth. The bacterium also plays an important role in bioremediation. Since there is no guarantee of a continuous supply of halogenated substrates in its natural environment, the question arises of how D. mccartyi maintains the synthesis and activity of dehalogenating enzymes under these conditions. Acetylation is a means by which energy-restricted microorganisms can modulate and maintain protein levels and their functionality. Here, we analyzed the proteome and Nepsilon-lysine acetylome of D. mccartyi strain CBDB1 during growth with 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene as an electron acceptor. The high abundance of the membrane-localized organohalide respiration complex, consisting of the reductive dehalogenases CbrA and CbdbA80, the uptake hydrogenase HupLS, and the organohalide respiration-associated molybdoenzyme OmeA, was shown throughout growth. In addition, the number of acetylated proteins increased from 5% to 11% during the transition from the exponential to the stationary phase. Acetylation of the key proteins of central acetate metabolism and of CbrA, CbdbA80, and TatA, a component of the twin-arginine translocation machinery, suggests that acetylation might contribute to maintenance of the organohalide-respiring capacity of the bacterium during the stationary phase, thus providing a means of ensuring membrane protein integrity and a proton gradient.
PXD017115	33674575	Mutant Huntingtin stalls ribosomes and represses protein synthesis in a cellular model of Huntington disease. 	Mutant huntingtin stalls ribosomes and represses protein synthesis independent of fragile X mental retardation protein	fragile X, huntingtin, protein synthesis, ribosome	The polyglutamine expansion of huntingtin (mHTT) causes Huntington disease (HD) and neurodegeneration, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that mHtt promotes ribosome stalling and suppresses protein synthesis in mouse HD striatal neuronal cells. Depletion of mHtt enhances protein synthesis and increases the speed of ribosomal translocation, while mHtt directly inhibits protein synthesis in vitro. Fmrp, a known regulator of ribosome stalling, is upregulated in HD, but its depletion has no discernible effect on protein synthesis or ribosome stalling in HD cells. We found interactions of ribosomal proteins and translating ribosomes with mHtt. High-resolution global ribosome footprint profiling (Ribo-Seq) and mRNA-Seq indicates a widespread shift in ribosome occupancy toward the 5' and 3' end and unique single-codon pauses on selected mRNA targets in HD cells, compared to controls. Thus, mHtt impedes ribosomal translocation during translation elongation, a mechanistic defect that can be exploited for HD therapeutics.
PXD024041	33675080	Poplar acetylome profiling reveals lysine acetylation dynamics in seasonal bud dormancy release. 	Poplar acetylome profiling reveals lysine acetylation dynamics in seasonal dormancy release.	Perennial, dormancy release, lysine acetylome, poplar	For perennials in boreal and temperate ecosystems, bud dormancy is crucial for survival in harsh winter. Dormancy is released by prolonged exposure to low temperatures and is followed by reactive growth in the spring. Lysine acetylation (Kac) is one of the major post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are involved in plant response to environmental signals. However, little information is available on the effects of Kac modification on bud dormancy release. Here, we report the dynamics of lysine acetylome in hybrid poplar (Populus tremula x Populus alba) dormant buds. A total of 7,594 acetyl-sites from 3,281 acetyl-proteins were identified, representing a large dataset of lysine acetylome in plants. Of them, 229 proteins were differentially acetylated during bud dormancy release and were mainly involved in the primary metabolic pathways. Site-directed mutagenesis enzymatic assays showed that Kac strongly modified the activities of two key enzymes of primary metabolism, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). We thus propose that Kac of enzymes could be an important strategy for reconfiguration of metabolic processes during bud dormancy release. In all, our results reveal the importance of Kac in bud dormancy release and provide a new perspective to understand the molecular mechanisms of seasonal growth of trees.
PXD022601	33675748	A long isoform of GIV/Girdin contains a PDZ-binding module that regulates localization and G-protein binding. 	Evolution of Modularity, Interactome and Functions of GIV/Girdin (CCDC88A) from Invertebrates to Vertebrates	cancer	PDZ domains are one of the most abundant protein domains in eukaryotes and are frequently found on junction-localized scaffold proteins. Various signaling molecules bind to PDZ proteins via PDZ-binding motifs (PBM) and fine-tune cellular signaling. However, how such interaction affects protein function is difficult to predict and must be solved empirically. Here we describe a long isoform of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GIV/Girdin (CCDC88A) that we named GIV-L, which is conserved throughout evolution, from invertebrates to vertebrates, and contains a PBM. Unlike GIV, which lacks PBM and is cytosolic, GIV-L localizes onto cell junctions and has a PDZ interactome (as shown through annotating Human Cell Map and BioID-proximity labeling studies), which impacts GIV-L's ability to bind and activate trimeric G-protein, Galphai, through its guanine-nucleotide exchange modulator (GEM) module. This GEM module is found exclusively in vertebrates. We propose that the two functional modules in GIV may have evolved sequentially: the ability to bind PDZ proteins via the PBM evolved earlier in invertebrates, whereas G-protein binding and activation may have evolved later only among vertebrates. Phenotypic studies in Caco-2 cells revealed that GIV and GIV-L may have antagonistic effects on cell growth, proliferation (cell cycle), and survival. Immunohistochemical analysis in human colon tissues showed that GIV expression increases with a concomitant decrease in GIV-L during cancer initiation. Taken together, these findings reveal how regulation in GIV/CCDC88A transcript helps to achieve protein modularity, which allows the protein to play opposing roles either as a tumor suppressor (GIV-L) or as an oncogene (GIV).
PXD022405	33676000	Proteomic Profiling of Gastric Signet Ring Cell Carcinoma Tissues Reveals Characteristic Changes of the Complement Cascade Pathway. 	Protein profiling reveals the characteristic changes of complement cascade pathway in the tissues of gastric signet ring cell carcinoma	Complement System Proteins, Signet Ring Cell, Stomach Neoplasms	Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is a histological subtype of gastric cancer with distinct features in multiple aspects compared with adenocarcinomas (ACs). The lack of a systematic molecular overview of this disease has led to slow progress in its clinical practice. In the present proteomics study, gastric tissues were collected from tumors and adjacent tissues, including 14 SRCCs and 34 ACs, and laser capture microdissection (LCM) was employed to eradicate the cellular heterogeneity of the tissues. The proteomes of tissues were profiled by data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS). Based on the over 6000 proteins quantified, univariate analysis and pathway enrichment revealed that some proteins and pathways demonstrated differences between SRCC and ACs. Importantly, the upregulation of a majority of complement-related proteins was notable for SRCC but not for ACs. A hypothesis, based on the proteomics evidence, was proposed that the complement cascade was evoked in the SRCC microenvironment upon infiltration, and the SRCC cells survived the complement cytotoxicity by secreting endogenous negative regulators. Moreover, an attempt was made to establish appropriate cell models for gastric SRCC through proteomic comparison of the 15 gastric cell lines and gastric tumors. The predictions of a supervised classifier suggested that none of these gastric cell lines qualified to mimic SRCC. This study discovered that the complement cascade is activated at a higher level in gastric SRCC than in ACs.
PXD023957	33676893	The phosphorylation of the Smad2/3 linker region by nemo-like kinase regulates TGF-beta signaling. 	The phosphorylation of the Smad2/3 linker region by Nemo-like kinase regulates TGF-beta signaling	NLK, Smad2, Smad3, phosphorylation	Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) are structurally similar proteins that primarily mediate the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling responsible for driving cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The dynamics of the Smad2/3 phosphorylation provide the key mechanism for regulating the TGF-beta signaling pathway, but the details surrounding this phosphorylation remain unclear. Here, using in vitro kinase assay coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified for the first time that nemo-like kinase (NLK) regulates TGF-beta signaling via modulation of Smad2/3 phosphorylation in the linker region. TGF-beta-mediated transcriptional and cellular responses are suppressed by NLK overexpression, whereas NLK depletion exerts opposite effects. Specifically, we discovered that NLK associates with Smad3 and phosphorylates the designated serine residues located in the linker region of Smad2 and Smad3, which inhibits phosphorylation at the C terminus, thereby decreasing the duration of TGF-beta signaling. Overall, this work demonstrates that phosphorylation on the linker region of Smad2/3 by NLK counteracts the canonical phosphorylation in response to TGF-beta signals, thus providing new insight into the mechanisms governing TGF-beta signaling transduction.
PXD023088	33676896	Nucleolin acts as the receptor for C1QTNF4 and supports C1QTNF4-mediated innate immunity modulation. 	Nucleolin is a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4	C1QTNF4, CTRP4, autoimmune disease, cell surface receptor, inflammation, innate immunity, monocyte, nucleolin, systemic lupus erythematosus	The C1q and TNF related 4 (C1QTNF4) protein is a structurally unique member of the C1QTNF family, a family of secreted proteins that have structural homology with both complement C1q and the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. C1QTNF4 has been linked to the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus through genetic studies; however, its role in immunity and inflammation remains poorly defined and a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4 has yet to be identified. Here we report identification of nucleolin as a cell surface receptor of C1QTNF4 using mass spectrometric analysis. Additionally, we present evidence that the interaction between C1QTNF4 and nucleolin is mediated by the second C1q-like domain of C1QTNF4 and the C terminus of nucleolin. We show that monocytes and B cells are target cells of C1QTNF4 and observe extensive binding to dead cells. Imaging flow cytometry experiments in monocytes show that C1QTNF4 becomes actively internalized upon cell binding. Our results suggest that nucleolin may serve as a docking molecule for C1QTNF4 and act in a context-dependent manner through coreceptors. Taken together, these findings further our understanding of C1QTNF4's function in the healthy immune system and how dysfunction may contribute to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus.
PXD023144	33676898	Packed red blood cells inhibit T-cell activation via ROS-dependent signaling pathways. 	Packed red blood cells inhibit T-cell activation via ROS-dependent signaling pathways	Tâ€cell, erythrocyte, immunosuppressor, phosphoproteomics, reactive oxygen species (ROS), redox regulation	Numerous observations indicate that red blood cells (RBCs) affect T-cell activation and proliferation. We have studied effects of packed RBCs (PRBCs) on T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and the molecular mechanisms whereby (P)RBCs modulate T-cell activation. In line with previous reports, PRBCs attenuated the expression of T-cell activation markers CD25 and CD69 upon costimulation via CD3/CD28. In addition, T-cell proliferation and cytokine expression were markedly reduced when T-cells were stimulated in the presence of PRBCs. Inhibitory activity of PRBCs required direct cell-cell contact and intact PRBCs. The production of activation-induced cellular reactive oxygen species, which act as second messengers in T-cells, was completely abrogated to levels of unstimulated T-cells in the presence of PRBCs. Phosphorylation of the TCR-related zeta chain and thus proximal TCR signal transduction was unaffected by PRBCs, ruling out mechanisms based on secreted factors and steric interaction restrictions. In large part, downstream signaling events requiring reactive oxygen species for full functionality were affected, as confirmed by an untargeted MS-based phosphoproteomics approach. PRBCs inhibited T-cell activation more efficiently than treatment with 1 mM of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. Taken together, our data imply that inflammation-related radical reactions are modulated by PRBCs. These immunomodulating effects may be responsible for clinical observations associated with transfusion of PRBCs.
PXD020751	33677602	Host-interactor screens of Phytophthora infestans RXLR proteins reveal vesicle trafficking as a major effector-targeted process. 	Host-interactor screens of Phytophthora infestans RXLR proteins	Nicotiana Benthamiana, Phytophthora infestans, RXLR effector proteins	Pathogens modulate plant cell structure and function by secreting effectors into host tissues. Effectors typically function by associating with host molecules and modulating their activities. This study aimed to identify the host processes targeted by the RXLR class of host-translocated effectors of the potato blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans. To this end, we performed an in planta protein-protein interaction screen by transiently expressing P. infestans RXLR effectors in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves followed by coimmunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. This screen generated an effector-host protein interactome matrix of 59 P. infestans RXLR effectors x 586 N. benthamiana proteins. Classification of the host interactors into putative functional categories revealed over 35 biological processes possibly targeted by P. infestans. We further characterized the PexRD12/31 family of RXLR-WY effectors, which associate and colocalize with components of the vesicle trafficking machinery. One member of this family, PexRD31, increased the number of FYVE positive vesicles in N. benthamiana cells. FYVE positive vesicles also accumulated in leaf cells near P. infestans hyphae, indicating that the pathogen may enhance endosomal trafficking during infection. This interactome dataset will serve as a useful resource for functional studies of P. infestans effectors and of effector-targeted host processes.
PXD019693	33683123	Human Bone Proteomes before and after Decomposition: Investigating the Effects of Biological Variation and Taphonomic Alteration on Bone Protein Profiles and the Implications for Forensic Proteomics. 	The implications of taphonomic alteration of human bone protein profiles for the development of a bone proteomics PMI/AAD estimation method.	Forensic proteomics, bone proteomics, chronological ageing, post-mortem interval, taphonomy	Bone proteomic studies using animal proxies and skeletonized human remains have delivered encouraging results in the search for potential biomarkers for precise and accurate post-mortem interval (PMI) and the age-at-death (AAD) estimation in medico-legal investigations. The development of forensic proteomics for PMI and AAD estimation is in critical need of research on human remains throughout decomposition, as currently the effects of both inter-individual biological differences and taphonomic alteration on the survival of human bone protein profiles are unclear. This study investigated the human bone proteome in four human body donors studied throughout decomposition outdoors. The effects of ageing phenomena (in vivo and post-mortem) and intrinsic and extrinsic variables on the variety and abundancy of the bone proteome were assessed. Results indicate that taphonomic and biological variables play a significant role in the survival of proteins in bone. Our findings suggest that inter-individual and inter-skeletal differences in bone mineral density (BMD) are important variables affecting the survival of proteins. Specific proteins survive better within the mineral matrix due to their mineral-binding properties. The mineral matrix likely also protects these proteins by restricting the movement of decomposer microbes. New potential biomarkers for PMI estimation and AAD estimation were identified. Future development of forensic bone proteomics should include standard measurement of BMD and target a combination of different biomarkers.
PXD033091	33683140	Aggressiveness and Metastatic Potential of Breast Cancer Cells Co-Cultured with Preadipocytes and Exposed to an Environmental Pollutant Dioxin: An in Vitro and in Vivo Zebrafish Study. 	Proteomic analysis of human neuronal SH-SY5Y in neurological diseases exposed to phtalates and metaks	brain, exposome, high pH fractionation, neuron, pathway analysis	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a major public health concern, and its prognosis is very poor once metastasis occurs. The tumor microenvironment and chemical pollution have been suggested recently to contribute, independently, to the development of metastatic cells. The BC microenvironment consists, in part, of adipocytes and preadipocytes in which persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can be stored. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the hypothesis that these two factors (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), an extensively studied, toxic POP and the microenvironment) may interact to increase tumor aggressiveness. METHODS: We used a co-culture model using BC MCF-7 cells or MDA-MB-231 cells together with hMADS preadipocytes to investigate the contribution of the microenvironment and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin TCDD on BC cells. Global differences were characterized using a high-throughput proteomic assay. Subsequently we measured the BC stem cell-like activity, analyzed the cell morphology, and used a zebrafish larvae model to study the metastatic potential of the BC cells. RESULTS: We found that coexposure to TCDD and preadipocytes modified BC cell properties; moreover, it induced the expression of ALDH1A3, a cancer stem cell marker, and the appearance of giant cancer cells with cell-in-cell structures (CICs), which are associated with malignant metastatic progression, that we demonstrated in vivo. DISCUSSION: The results of our study using BC cell lines co-cultured with preadipocytes and a POP and an in vivo zebrafish model of metastasis suggest that the interactions between BC cells and their microenvironment could affect their invasive or metastatic potential. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7102.
PXD019456	33683571	Molecular alterations in oral cancer using high-throughput proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. 	Quantitative proteomic analysis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) based on pathological grading using FFPE blocks using high-resolution mass spectrometry	Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, Orbitrap, biomarkers, omics technology, proteomic profiling	Loss of cell differentiation is a hallmark for the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Archival Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues constitute a valuable resource for studying the differentiation of OSCC and can offer valuable insights into the process of tumor progression. In the current study, we performed LC-MS/MS-based quantitative proteomics of FFPE specimens from pathologically-confirmed well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated, and poorly-differentiated OSCC cases. The data were analyzed in four technical replicates, resulting in the identification of 2376 proteins. Of these, 141 and 109 were differentially expressed in moderately-differentiated and poorly differentiated OSCC cases, respectively, compared to well-differentiated OSCC. The data revealed significant metabolic reprogramming with respect to lipid metabolism and glycolysis with proteins belonging to both these processes downregulated in moderately-differentiated OSCC when compared to well-differentiated OSCC. Signaling pathway analysis indicated the alteration of extracellular matrix organization, muscle contraction, and glucose metabolism pathways across tumor grades. The extracellular matrix organization pathway was upregulated in moderately-differentiated OSCC and downregulated in poorly differentiated OSCC, compared to well-differentiated OSCC. PADI4, an epigenetic enzyme transcriptional regulator, and its transcriptional target HIST1H1B were both found to be upregulated in moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated OSCC, indicating epigenetic events underlying tumor differentiation. In conclusion, the findings support the advantage of using high-resolution mass spectrometry-based FFPE archival blocks for clinical and translational research. The candidate signaling pathways identified in the study could be used to develop potential therapeutic targets for OSCC.
PXD024914	33683887	Global Profiling of Lysine Accessibility to Evaluate Protein Structure Changes in Alzheimer's Disease. 	Global Profiling of Lysine Accessibility to Evaluate Protein Structure Changes in Alzheimer's Disease	Alzheimer's disease, and tau, structural mass spectrometry, structuromics, tandem mass tag	The linear sequence of amino acids in a protein folds into a 3D structure to execute protein activity and function, but it is still challenging to profile the 3D structure at the proteome scale. Here, we present a method of native protein tandem mass tag (TMT) profiling of Lys accessibility and its application to investigate structural alterations in human brain specimens of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this method, proteins are extracted under a native condition, labeled by TMT reagents, followed by trypsin digestion and peptide analysis using two-dimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS). The method quantifies Lys labeling efficiency to evaluate its accessibility on the protein surface, which may be affected by protein conformations, protein modifications, and/or other molecular interactions. We systematically optimized the amount of TMT reagents, reaction time, and temperature and then analyzed protein samples under multiple conditions, including different labeling time (5 and 30 min), heat treatment, AD and normal human cases. The experiment profiled 15370 TMT-labeled peptides in 4475 proteins. As expected, the heat treatment led to extensive changes in protein conformations, with 17% of the detected proteome displaying differential labeling. Compared to the normal controls, AD brain showed different Lys accessibility of tau and RNA splicing complexes, which are the hallmarks of AD pathology, as well as proteins involved in transcription, mitochondrial, and synaptic functions. To eliminate the possibility that the observed differential Lys labeling was caused by protein level change, the whole proteome was quantified with standard TMT-LC/LC-MS/MS for normalization. Thus, this native protein TMT method enables the proteome-wide measurement of Lys accessibility, representing a straightforward strategy to explore protein structure in any biological system.
PXD022604	33684213	Reactive astrocytes in ALS display diminished intron retention. 	Reactive astrocytes in ALS display dysregulated intron retention	Alternative splicing, RNA sequencing, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, astrocytes, human induced pluripotent stem cell, intron retention, motor neuron disease, neurodegeneration, reactive astrocytes, transcriptome profiling	Reactive astrocytes are implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although the mechanisms controlling reactive transformation are unknown. We show that decreased intron retention (IR) is common to human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes carrying ALS-causing mutations in VCP, SOD1 and C9orf72. Notably, transcripts with decreased IR and increased expression are overrepresented in reactivity processes including cell adhesion, stress response and immune activation. This was recapitulated in public-datasets for (i) hiPSC-derived astrocytes stimulated with cytokines to undergo reactive transformation and (ii) in vivo astrocytes following selective deletion of TDP-43. We also re-examined public translatome sequencing (TRAP-seq) of astrocytes from a SOD1 mouse model, which revealed that transcripts upregulated in translation significantly overlap with transcripts exhibiting decreased IR. Using nucleocytoplasmic fractionation of VCP mutant astrocytes coupled with mRNA sequencing and proteomics, we identify that decreased IR in nuclear transcripts is associated with enhanced nonsense mediated decay and increased cytoplasmic expression of transcripts and proteins regulating reactive transformation. These findings are consistent with a molecular model for reactive transformation in astrocytes whereby poised nuclear reactivity-related IR transcripts are spliced, undergo nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation and translation. Our study therefore provides new insights into the molecular regulation of reactive transformation in astrocytes.
PXD018914	33686291	Target protein deglycosylation in living cells by a nanobody-fused split O-GlcNAcase. 	Targeted deglycosylation with a nanobody-directed split OGA in living cells	Glycoproteomics (B/D-HPP), Human Proteome Project, O-GlcNAc, OGA, ProteomeXchange project tag: Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), c-Jun, nanobody	O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an essential and dynamic post-translational modification that is presented on thousands of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. Interrogating the role of O-GlcNAc on a single target protein is crucial, yet challenging to perform in cells. Herein, we developed a nanobody-fused split O-GlcNAcase (OGA) as an O-GlcNAc eraser for selective deglycosylation of a target protein in cells. After systematic cellular optimization, we identified a split OGA with reduced inherent deglycosidase activity that selectively removed O-GlcNAc from the desired target protein when directed by a nanobody. We demonstrate the generality of the nanobody-fused split OGA using four nanobodies against five target proteins and use the system to study the impact of O-GlcNAc on the transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos. The nanobody-directed O-GlcNAc eraser provides a new strategy for the functional evaluation and engineering of O-GlcNAc via the selective removal of O-GlcNAc from individual proteins directly in cells.
PXD017812	33687211	Ultra-High-Resolution IonStar Strategy Enhancing Accuracy and Precision of MS1-Based Proteomics and an Extensive Comparison with State-of-the-Art SWATH-MS in Large-Cohort Quantification. 	An ultra-high-resolution IonStar strategy enhancing accuracy and precision of MS1-based proteomics and an extensive comparison with state-of-the-art SWATH-MS in large-cohort quantification	120k technical replicates, SWATH-MS, ultrahigh resolution IonStar	Quantitative proteomics in large cohorts is highly valuable for clinical/pharmaceutical investigations but often suffers from severely compromised reliability, accuracy, and reproducibility. Here, we describe an ultra-high-resolution IonStar method achieving reproducible protein measurement in large cohorts while minimizing the ratio compression problem, by taking advantage of the exceptional selectivity of ultra-high-resolution (UHR)-MS1 detection (240k_FWHM@m/z = 200). Using mixed-proteome benchmark sets reflecting large-cohort analysis with technical or biological replicates (N = 56), we comprehensively compared the quantitative performances of UHR-IonStar vs a state-of-the-art SWATH-MS method, each with their own optimal analytical platforms. We confirmed a cutting-edge micro-liquid chromatography (LC)/Triple-TOF with Spectronaut outperforms nano-LC/Orbitrap for SWATH-MS, which was then meticulously developed/optimized to maximize sensitivity, reproducibility, and proteome coverage. While the two methods with distinct principles (i.e., MS1- vs MS2-based) showed similar depth-of-analysis (~6700-7000 missing-data-free proteins quantified, 1% protein-false discovery rate (FDR) for entire set, 2 unique peptides/protein) and good accuracy/precision in quantifying high-abundance proteins, UHR-IonStar achieved substantially superior quantitative accuracy, precision, and reproducibility for lower-abundance proteins (a category that includes most regulatory proteins), as well as much-improved sensitivity/selectivity for discovering significantly altered proteins. Furthermore, compared to SWATH-MS, UHR-IonStar showed markedly higher accuracy for a single analysis of each sample across a large set, which is an inadequately investigated albeit critical parameter for large-cohort analysis. Finally, we compared UHR-IonStar vs SWATH-MS in measuring the time courses of altered proteins in paclitaxel-treated cells (N = 36), where dysregulated biological pathways have been very well established. UHR-IonStar discovered substantially more well-recognized biological processes/pathways induced by paclitaxel. Additionally, UHR-IonStar showed markedly superior ability than SWATH-MS in accurately depicting the time courses of well known to be paclitaxel-induced biomarkers. In summary, UHR-IonStar represents a reliable, robust, and cost-effective solution for large-cohort proteomic quantification with excellent accuracy and precision.
PXD018168	33687715	Mass Spectrometry-Based Analysis of Mycobacterial Single-Colony Proteome. 	Mass spectrometry-based analysis of Mycobacterial single-colony proteome	Mycobacteria, Single-colony, bacterial proteome, protein extraction	Mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomic analysis has recently gained momentum and is now an emerging area with established protocols and promising results. Traditional proteomic studies, especially involving bacteria, have been limited to suspension cultures with large protein yields. Such studies, however, remain population centered with the uniqueness of individual responses to environmental challenges becoming diluted. To enable bacterial single-colony proteomics, we describe a quantitative mass spectrometry-based protocol to isolate and analyze the proteome of a single mycobacterial colony from 7H10 media, with growth supplements for optimal growth. Following protein purification and digestion, tryptic peptides are analyzed by UHPLC coupled to a hybrid Q Exactive mass spectrometer. Raw data were analyzed using the MaxQuant Suite, and downstream statistical analysis was performed using Perseus software. A total of 7805 unique peptides and 1387 proteins were identified. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD018168. In this chapter, we identify steps most prone to sample loss and describe measures of alleviation that allows the preservation of protein yield and boosts quantitative power while increasing reproducibility, of "very limiting samples."
PXD023052	33690076	Protein profile of commercial soybean milks analyzed by label-free quantitative proteomics. 	Protein profile of commercial soybean milks analyzed by label-free quantitative proteomics	Allergen, Functional drink/beverage, Plant-based milk, Soy drink, Soy milk	The consumption of soy milk is increasing worldwide for its nutritional value and health benefits, however, its protein composition after commercialization is not well known. Technological and thermal treatments to which soy milk is subjected could affect the protein composition of the commercial products. This study compared the protein profile of 15 different commercial soy milks using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach. Proteins related to nutrient reservoir activity, endopeptidase inhibitor activity, lipid binding, and seed maturation contribute the most in terms of percentage mass. Their associated Gene Ontology terms are also enriched. Samples clustered into three groups based on their protein composition, with glycinins and beta-conglycinins being the most influential for determining the clustering. Amino acid composition estimated from the proteomics data also reflects the clustering of samples. Twenty allergenic proteins varying in abundance were identified, with Gly m 5 and Gly m 6 being the predominantly abundant allergens.
PXD020089	33691097	Itaconate confers tolerance to late NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 	IRG1 Inflammasome Proteomics Experiments	BMDM, IRG1, LCMS, LPS, itaconylation	Itaconate is a unique regulatory metabolite that is induced upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation in myeloid cells. Here, we demonstrate major inflammatory tolerance and cell death phenotypes associated with itaconate production in activated macrophages. We show that endogenous itaconate is a key regulator of the signal 2 of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation after long lipopolysaccharide (LPS) priming, which establishes tolerance to late NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that itaconate acts synergistically with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and that the ability of various TLR ligands to establish NLRP3 inflammasome tolerance depends on the pattern of co-expression of IRG1 and iNOS. Mechanistically, itaconate accumulation upon prolonged inflammatory stimulation prevents full caspase-1 activation and processing of gasdermin D, which we demonstrate to be post-translationally modified by endogenous itaconate. Altogether, our data demonstrate that metabolic rewiring in inflammatory macrophages establishes tolerance to NLRP3 inflammasome activation that, if uncontrolled, can result in pyroptotic cell death and tissue damage.
PXD018659	33691121	Proteomics reveals distinct mechanisms regulating the release of cytokines and alarmins during pyroptosis. 	Cell-selective proteomics segregates pancreatic cancer subtypes by extracellular proteins in tumors and circulation	PDAC, azidonorleucine, cell-selective, extracellular matrix, pancreatic cancer, secretomics, serum, tumor	A major pathway for proinflammatory protein release by macrophages is inflammasome-mediated pyroptotic cell death. As conventional secretion, unconventional secretion, and cell death are executed simultaneously, however, the cellular mechanisms regulating this complex paracrine program remain incompletely understood. Here, we devise a quantitative proteomics strategy to define the cellular exit route for each protein by pharmacological and genetic dissection of cellular checkpoints regulating protein release. We report the release of hundreds of proteins during pyroptosis, predominantly due to cell lysis. They comprise constitutively expressed and transcriptionally induced proteins derived from the cytoplasm and specific intracellular organelles. Many low-molecular-weight proteins including the cytokine interleukin-1beta, alarmins, and lysosomal-cargo proteins exit cells in the absence of cell lysis. Cytokines and alarmins are released in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi-dependent manner as free proteins rather than by extracellular vesicles. Our work provides an experimental framework for the dissection of cellular exit pathways and a resource for pyroptotic protein release.
PXD023780	33691122	Multiple unbiased approaches identify oxidosqualene cyclase as the molecular target of a promising anti-leishmanial. 	Multiple unbiased approaches identify oxidosqualene cyclase as the molecular target of a promising anti-leishmanial	leishmania, oxidosqualene synthase, thermal proteome profiling	Phenotypic screening identified a benzothiophene compound with activity against Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. Using multiple orthogonal approaches, oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC), a key enzyme of sterol biosynthesis, was identified as the target of this racemic compound and its enantiomers. Whole genome sequencing and screening of a genome-wide overexpression library confirmed that OSC gene amplification is associated with resistance to compound 1. Introduction of an ectopic copy of the OSC gene into wild-type cells reduced susceptibility to these compounds confirming the role of this enzyme in resistance. Biochemical analyses demonstrated the accumulation of the substrate of OSC and depletion of its product in compound (S)-1-treated-promastigotes and cell-free membrane preparations, respectively. Thermal proteome profiling confirmed that compound (S)-1 binds directly to OSC. Finally, modeling and docking studies identified key interactions between compound (S)-1 and the LdOSC active site. Strategies to improve the potency for this promising anti-leishmanial are proposed.
PXD023533	33692360	Structural basis for VPS34 kinase activation by Rab1 and Rab5 on membranes. 	Rab5a-VPS34 unnatural amino acid mediated crosslinking	Rab5a, VPS34, crosslinking/mass spectrometry, unnatural amino acid mediated crosslinking	The lipid phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) is a regulator of two fundamental but distinct cellular processes, endocytosis and autophagy, so its generation needs to be under precise temporal and spatial control. PI3P is generated by two complexes that both contain the lipid kinase VPS34: complex II on endosomes (VPS34/VPS15/Beclin 1/UVRAG), and complex I on autophagosomes (VPS34/VPS15/Beclin 1/ATG14L). The endosomal GTPase Rab5 binds complex II, but the mechanism of VPS34 activation by Rab5 has remained elusive, and no GTPase is known to bind complex I. Here we show that Rab5a-GTP recruits endocytic complex II to membranes and activates it by binding between the VPS34 C2 and VPS15 WD40 domains. Electron cryotomography of complex II on Rab5a-decorated vesicles shows that the VPS34 kinase domain is released from inhibition by VPS15 and hovers over the lipid bilayer, poised for catalysis. We also show that the GTPase Rab1a, which is known to be involved in autophagy, recruits and activates the autophagy-specific complex I, but not complex II. Both Rabs bind to the same VPS34 interface but in a manner unique for each. These findings reveal how VPS34 complexes are activated on membranes by specific Rab GTPases and how they are recruited to unique cellular locations.
PXD013593	33692444	Post translational modifications of milk proteins in geographically diverse goat breeds. 	Identification and characterization of bioactive peptides in relation to different genotypes, production status and geographical region	Bioactive peptides, Capra hircus, goat milk	Goat milk is a source of nutrition in difficult areas and has lesser allerginicity than cow milk. It is leading in the area for nutraceutical formulation and drug development using goat mammary gland as a bioreactor. Post translational modifications of a protein regulate protein function, biological activity, stabilization and interactions. The protein variants of goat milk from 10 breeds were studied for the post translational modifications by combining highly sensitive 2DE and Q-Exactive LC-MS/MS. Here we observed high levels of post translational modifications in 201 peptides of 120 goat milk proteins. The phosphosites observed for CSN2, CSN1S1, CSN1S2, CSN3 were 11P, 13P, 17P and 6P, respectively in 105 casein phosphopeptides. Whey proteins BLG and LALBA showed 19 and 4 phosphosites respectively. Post translational modification was observed in 45 low abundant non-casein milk proteins mainly associated with signal transduction, immune system, developmental biology and metabolism pathways. Pasp is reported for the first time in 47 sites. The rare conserved peptide sequence of (SSSEE) was observed in alphaS1 and alphaS2 casein. The functional roles of identified phosphopeptides included anti-microbial, DPP-IV inhibitory, anti-inflammatory and ACE inhibitory. This is first report from tropics, investigating post translational modifications in casein and non-casein goat milk proteins and studies their interactions.
PXD012642	33692486	Non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals promote the transmission of multidrug resistance plasmids through intra- and intergenera conjugation. 	Proteomic analysis of E. coli K-12 LE392, P. putida KT2440 under exposure of six non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals	E. coli, P. putida, SWATH-MS, non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals	Antibiotic resistance is a global threat to public health. The use of antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations has been recognized as an important factor in disseminating antibiotic resistance via horizontal gene transfer. Although non-antibiotic, human-targeted pharmaceuticals are widely used by society (95% of the pharmaceuticals market), the potential contribution to the spread of antibiotic resistance is not clear. Here, we report that commonly consumed, non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), a lipid-lowering drug (gemfibrozil), and a beta-blocker (propranolol), at clinically and environmentally relevant concentrations, significantly accelerated the dissemination of antibiotic resistance via plasmid-borne bacterial conjugation. Various indicators were used to study the bacterial response to these drugs, including monitoring reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell membrane permeability by flow cytometry, cell arrangement, and whole-genome RNA and protein sequencing. Enhanced conjugation correlated well with increased production of ROS and cell membrane permeability. Additionally, these non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals induced responses similar to those detected when bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, such as inducing the SOS response and enhancing efflux pumps. The findings advance understanding of the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes, emphasizing the concern that non-antibiotic, human-targeted pharmaceuticals enhance the spread of antibiotic resistance among bacterial populations.
PXD021144	33693030	Circulating Exosomes Are Strongly Involved in SARS-CoV-2 Infection. 	Mapping the Host Circulating Exosome Response to SARS-CoV-2	SARS-CoV-2, biomarkers, host response, plasma exosomes	Knowledge of the host response to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 remains limited, hindering the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies. During the course of a viral infection, host cells release exosomes and other extracellular vesicles carrying viral and host components that can modulate the immune response. The present study used a shotgun proteomic approach to map the host circulating exosomes' response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated how SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates exosome content, exosomes' involvement in disease progression, and the potential use of plasma exosomes as biomarkers of disease severity. A proteomic analysis of patient-derived exosomes identified several molecules involved in the immune response, inflammation, and activation of the coagulation and complement pathways, which are the main mechanisms of COVID-19-associated tissue damage and multiple organ dysfunctions. In addition, several potential biomarkers-such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, complement C1r subcomponent and serum amyloid P-component-were shown to have a diagnostic feature presenting an area under the curve (AUC) of almost 1. Proteins correlating with disease severity were also detected. Moreover, for the first time, we identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the exosomal cargo, which suggests that the virus might use the endocytosis route to spread infection. Our findings indicate circulating exosomes' significant contribution to several processes-such as inflammation, coagulation, and immunomodulation-during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study's data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD021144.
PXD016055	33693809	Human METTL18 is a histidine-specific methyltransferase that targets RPL3 and affects ribosome biogenesis and function. 	Proteomics exploration of the human RPL3 interactome	Affinity proteomics, GFP-pulldown, Interactomics	Protein methylation occurs primarily on lysine and arginine, but also on some other residues, such as histidine. METTL18 is the last uncharacterized member of a group of human methyltransferases (MTases) that mainly exert lysine methylation, and here we set out to elucidate its function. We found METTL18 to be a nuclear protein that contains a functional nuclear localization signal and accumulates in nucleoli. Recombinant METTL18 methylated a single protein in nuclear extracts and in isolated ribosomes from METTL18 knockout (KO) cells, identified as 60S ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3). We also performed an RPL3 interactomics screen and identified METTL18 as the most significantly enriched MTase. We found that His-245 in RPL3 carries a 3-methylhistidine (3MH; tau-methylhistidine) modification, which was absent in METTL18 KO cells. In addition, both recombinant and endogenous METTL18 were found to be automethylated at His-154, thus further corroborating METTL18 as a histidine-specific MTase. Finally, METTL18 KO cells displayed altered pre-rRNA processing, decreased polysome formation and codon-specific changes in mRNA translation, indicating that METTL18-mediated methylation of RPL3 is important for optimal ribosome biogenesis and function. In conclusion, we have here established METTL18 as the second human histidine-specific protein MTase, and demonstrated its functional relevance.
PXD023162	33693821	An RNA tagging approach for system-wide RNA-binding proteome profiling and dynamics investigation upon transcription inhibition. 	Large-scale identification of RNA-binding proteins	RNA-binding proteins(RBPs), large-scale	RNA-protein interactions play key roles in epigenetic, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. To reveal the regulatory mechanisms of these interactions, global investigation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and monitor their changes under various physiological conditions are needed. Herein, we developed a psoralen probe (PP)-based method for RNA tagging and ribonucleic-protein complex (RNP) enrichment. Isolation of both coding and noncoding RNAs and mapping of 2986 RBPs including 782 unknown candidate RBPs from HeLa cells was achieved by PP enrichment, RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis. The dynamics study of RNPs by PP enrichment after the inhibition of RNA synthesis provides the first large-scale distribution profile of RBPs bound to RNAs with different decay rates. Furthermore, the remarkably greater decreases in the abundance of the RBPs obtained by PP-enrichment than by global proteome profiling suggest that PP enrichment after transcription inhibition offers a valuable way for large-scale evaluation of the candidate RBPs.
PXD023852	33694180	HDAC6 inhibition restores TDP-43 pathology and axonal transport defects in human motor neurons with TARDBP mutations. 	HDAC6 inhibition restores TDP-43 pathology and axonal transport defects in human motor neurons with TARDBP mutations	ALS, HDAC6, TARDPB mutation, TDP-43, axonal transport, induced pluripotent stem cells, interactome	TDP-43 is the major component of pathological inclusions in most ALS patients and in up to 50% of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Heterozygous missense mutations in TARDBP, the gene encoding TDP-43, are one of the common causes of familial ALS. In this study, we investigate TDP-43 protein behavior in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons from three ALS patients with different TARDBP mutations, three healthy controls and an isogenic control. TARDPB mutations induce several TDP-43 changes in spinal motor neurons, including cytoplasmic mislocalization and accumulation of insoluble TDP-43, C-terminal fragments, and phospho-TDP-43. By generating iPSC lines with allele-specific tagging of TDP-43, we find that mutant TDP-43 initiates the observed disease phenotypes and has an altered interactome as indicated by mass spectrometry. Our findings also indicate that TDP-43 proteinopathy results in a defect in mitochondrial transport. Lastly, we show that pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) restores the observed TDP-43 pathologies and the axonal mitochondrial motility, suggesting that HDAC6 inhibition may be an interesting therapeutic target for neurodegenerative disorders linked to TDP-43 pathology.
PXD023689	33704935	Proteomics reveals the function reverse of MPSSS-treated prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts to suppress PC-3 cell viability via the FoxO pathway. 	Proteomics reveals the function reverse of MPSSS treated prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts to suppress PC-3 cell viability via the FoxO pathway	prostate CAFs, prostate cancer cells, secretomics	Prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts (prostate CAFs) are essential components of the tumor microenvironment and can promote tumor progression through their immunosuppressive functions. MPSSS, a novel polysaccharide purified from Lentinus edodes, has been reported to have anti-tumor activity. MPSSS could also inhibit the immunosuppressive function of prostate CAFs, which has been demonstrated through that the secretome of MPSSS-treated prostate CAFs could inhibit the proliferation of T cells. However, how the secretome of MPSSS-treated prostate CAFs influence prostate cancer progression is still unclear. Interestingly, we found that the low molecular weight (3-100kD) secretome of prostate CAFs (lmwCAFS) could promote the growth of PC-3 cells, while that of MPSSS-treated prostate CAFs (MT-lmwCAFS) could inhibit their growth. We carried out comparative secretomic analysis of lmwCAFS and MT-lmwCAFS to identify functional molecules that inhibit the growth of PC-3 cells, and proteomic analysis of lmwCAFS-treated PC-3 cells and MT-lmwCAFS-treated PC-3 cells to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism. These analyses suggest that TGF-beta3 from MT-lmwCAFS may inhibit the growth of PC-3 cells. The validated experiments revealed that TGF-beta3 from MT-lmwCAFS activated p21 expression in PC-3 cells by regulating the FoxO pathway thereby inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of PC-3 cells. Overall, our data demonstrated that MPSSS reversed the ability of prostate CAFs to suppress the cell viability of PC-3 cells, which might provide a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent prostate cancer progression.
PXD022785	33705380	Molecular characterization of the conoid complex in Toxoplasma reveals its conservation in all apicomplexans, including Plasmodium species. 	Toxoplasma conoid proteome by BioID	Apicomplexa, BioID, IMC, Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, apical complex, conoid, pellicle	The apical complex is the instrument of invasion used by apicomplexan parasites, and the conoid is a conspicuous feature of this apparatus found throughout this phylum. The conoid, however, is believed to be heavily reduced or missing from Plasmodium species and other members of the class Aconoidasida. Relatively few conoid proteins have previously been identified, making it difficult to address how conserved this feature is throughout the phylum, and whether it is genuinely missing from some major groups. Moreover, parasites such as Plasmodium species cycle through 3 invasive forms, and there is the possibility of differential presence of the conoid between these stages. We have applied spatial proteomics and high-resolution microscopy to develop a more complete molecular inventory and understanding of the organisation of conoid-associated proteins in the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. These data revealed molecular conservation of all conoid substructures throughout Apicomplexa, including Plasmodium, and even in allied Myzozoa such as Chromera and dinoflagellates. We reporter-tagged and observed the expression and location of several conoid complex proteins in the malaria model P. berghei and revealed equivalent structures in all of its zoite forms, as well as evidence of molecular differentiation between blood-stage merozoites and the ookinetes and sporozoites of the mosquito vector. Collectively, we show that the conoid is a conserved apicomplexan element at the heart of the invasion mechanisms of these highly successful and often devastating parasites.
PXD023479	33706382	SIRT3 consolidates heterochromatin and counteracts senescence. 	Nuclear SIRT3 counteracts human stem cell senescence	LAD, SIRT3, aging, stem cell	Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase linked to a broad range of physiological and pathological processes, including aging and aging-related diseases. However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating human stem cell homeostasis remains unclear. Here we found that SIRT3 expression was downregulated in senescent human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion of SIRT3 led to compromised nuclear integrity, loss of heterochromatin and accelerated senescence in hMSCs. Further analysis indicated that SIRT3 interacted with nuclear envelope proteins and heterochromatin-associated proteins. SIRT3 deficiency resulted in the detachment of genomic lamina-associated domains (LADs) from the nuclear lamina, increased chromatin accessibility and aberrant repetitive sequence transcription. The re-introduction of SIRT3 rescued the disorganized heterochromatin and the senescence phenotypes. Taken together, our study reveals a novel role for SIRT3 in stabilizing heterochromatin and counteracting hMSC senescence, providing new potential therapeutic targets to ameliorate aging-related diseases.
PXD018090	33706811	SRSF3 and SRSF7 modulate 3'UTR length through suppression or activation of proximal polyadenylation sites and regulation of CFIm levels. 	SRSF7 and SRSF3 affectSRSF7 and SRSF3 affect 3'UTR length in opposite directions by controlling proximal poly(A)-site usage and CFIm levels  3'UTR length in opposite directions by controlling proximal poly(A)-site usage and CFIm levels	CFIm, CPSF5, CPSF6, DaPars, FIP1, MACE, SRSF3, SRSF7, alternative polyadenylation, iCLIP, poly(A) site	BACKGROUND: Alternative polyadenylation (APA) refers to the regulated selection of polyadenylation sites (PASs) in transcripts, which determines the length of their 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs). We have recently shown that SRSF3 and SRSF7, two closely related SR proteins, connect APA with mRNA export. The mechanism underlying APA regulation by SRSF3 and SRSF7 remained unknown. RESULTS: Here we combine iCLIP and 3'-end sequencing and find that SRSF3 and SRSF7 bind upstream of proximal PASs (pPASs), but they exert opposite effects on 3'UTR length. SRSF7 enhances pPAS usage in a concentration-dependent but splicing-independent manner by recruiting the cleavage factor FIP1, generating short 3'UTRs. Protein domains unique to SRSF7, which are absent from SRSF3, contribute to FIP1 recruitment. In contrast, SRSF3 promotes distal PAS (dPAS) usage and hence long 3'UTRs directly by counteracting SRSF7, but also indirectly by maintaining high levels of cleavage factor Im (CFIm) via alternative splicing. Upon SRSF3 depletion, CFIm levels decrease and 3'UTRs are shortened. The indirect SRSF3 targets are particularly sensitive to low CFIm levels, because here CFIm serves a dual function; it enhances dPAS and inhibits pPAS usage by binding immediately downstream and assembling unproductive cleavage complexes, which together promotes long 3'UTRs. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that SRSF3 and SRSF7 are direct modulators of pPAS usage and show how small differences in the domain architecture of SR proteins can confer opposite effects on pPAS regulation.
PXD023281	33708194	Long-Term Liver Expression of an Apolipoprotein A-I Mimetic Peptide Attenuates Interferon-Alpha-Induced Inflammation and Promotes Antiviral Activity. 	Long-term liver expression of an apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide attenuates IFNalpha-induced inflammation and promotes antiviral activity	Adeno-associated virus, antiviral, apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide, liver, type I IFN	Apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptides are amphipathic alpha-helix peptides that display similar functions to apolipoprotein A-I. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptides in multiple indications associated with inflammatory processes. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the long-term expression of L37pA in the liver by an adeno-associated virus (AAV-L37pA) on the expression of an adeno-associated virus encoding interferon-alpha (AAV-IFNalpha). Long-term IFNalpha expression in the liver leads to lethal hematological toxicity one month after AAV administration. Concomitant administration of AAV-L37pA prevented the lethal toxicity since the IFNalpha expression was reduced one month after AAV administration. To identify the mechanism of action of L37pA, a genomic and proteomic analysis was performed 15 days after AAV administration when a similar level of IFNalpha and interferon-stimulated genes were observed in mice treated with AAV-IFNalpha alone and in mice treated with AAV-IFNalpha and AAV-L37pA. The coexpression of the apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide L37pA with IFNalpha modulated the gene expression program of IFNalpha, inducing a significant reduction in inflammatory pathways affecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns receptor, dendritic cells, NK cells and Th1 immune response. The proteomic analysis confirmed the impact of the L37pA activity on several inflammatory pathways and indicated an activation of LXR/RXR and PPPARalpha/gamma nuclear receptors. Thus, long-term expression of L37pA induces an anti-inflammatory effect in the liver that allows silencing of IFNalpha expression mediated by an adeno-associated virus.
PXD012084	33711480	Quantifying Positional Isomers (QPI) by Top-Down Mass Spectrometry. 	Quantifying Positional Isomers (QPI) by top-down mass spectrometry	ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, Top-down mass spectrometry, phosphorylation, positional isomers, quantitation	Proteomics has exposed a plethora of posttranslational modifications, but demonstrating functional relevance requires new approaches. Top-down proteomics of intact proteins has the potential to fully characterize protein modifications in terms of amount, site(s), and the order in which they are deposited on the protein; information that so far has been elusive to extract by shotgun proteomics. Data acquisition and analysis of intact multimodified proteins have however been a major challenge, in particular for positional isomers that carry the same number of modifications at different sites. Solutions were previously proposed to extract this information from fragmentation spectra, but these have so far mainly been limited to peptides and have entailed a large degree of manual interpretation. Here, we apply high-resolution Orbitrap fusion top-down analyses in combination with bioinformatics approaches to attempt to characterize multiple modified proteins and quantify positional isomers. Automated covalent fragment ion type definition, detection of mass precision and accuracy, and extensive use of replicate spectra increase sequence coverage and drive down false fragment assignments from 10% to 1.5%. Such improved performance in fragment assignment is key to localize and quantify modifications from fragment spectra. The method is tested by investigating positional isomers of Ubiquitin mixed in known concentrations, which results in quantification of high ratios at very low standard errors of the mean (<5%), as well as with synthetic phosphorylated peptides. Application to multiphosphorylated Bora provides an estimation of the so far unknown stoichiometry of the known set of phosphosites and uncovers new sites from hyperphosphorylated Bora.
PXD016615	33713138	The Arabidopsis mediator complex subunit 8 regulates oxidative stress responses. 	The Arabidopsis Mediator complex subunit 8 regulates oxidative stress responses	MED8, Mediator complex, catalase, hydrogen peroxide, oxidative stress	Signaling events triggered by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) regulate plant growth and defense by orchestrating a genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming. However, the specific mechanisms that govern H2O2-dependent gene expression are still poorly understood. Here, we identify the Arabidopsis Mediator complex subunit MED8 as a regulator of H2O2 responses. The introduction of the med8 mutation in a constitutive oxidative stress genetic background (catalase-deficient, cat2) was associated with enhanced activation of the salicylic acid pathway and accelerated cell death. Interestingly, med8 seedlings were more tolerant to oxidative stress generated by the herbicide methyl viologen (MV) and exhibited transcriptional hyperactivation of defense signaling, in particular salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-related pathways. The med8-triggered tolerance to MV was manipulated by the introduction of secondary mutations in salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways. In addition, analysis of the Mediator interactome revealed interactions with components involved in mRNA processing and microRNA biogenesis, hence expanding the role of Mediator beyond transcription. Notably, MED8 interacted with the transcriptional regulator NEGATIVE ON TATA-LESS, NOT2, to control the expression of H2O2-inducible genes and stress responses. Our work establishes MED8 as a component regulating oxidative stress responses and demonstrates that it acts as a negative regulator of H2O2-driven activation of defense gene expression.
PXD022332	33713600	Y box binding protein 1 inhibition as a targeted therapy for ovarian cancer. 	Y Box Binding Protein 1 Inhibition as a Targeted Therapy for Ovarian Cancer	ovarian cancer, therapeutics	Y box binding protein 1 (YB-1) is a multifunctional protein associated with tumor progression and the emergence of treatment resistance (TR). Here, we report an azopodophyllotoxin small molecule, SU056, that potently inhibits tumor growth and progression via YB-1 inhibition. This YB-1 inhibitor inhibits cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis in ovarian cancer (OC) cells, and arrests in the G1 phase. Inhibitor treatment leads to enrichment of proteins associated with apoptosis and RNA degradation pathways while downregulating spliceosome pathway. In vivo, SU056 independently restrains OC progression and exerts a synergistic effect with paclitaxel to further reduce disease progression with no observable liver toxicity. Moreover, in vitro mechanistic studies showed delayed disease progression via inhibition of drug efflux and multidrug resistance 1, and significantly lower neurotoxicity as compared with etoposide. These data suggest that YB-1 inhibition may be an effective strategy to reduce OC progression, antagonize TR, and decrease patient mortality.
PXD019523	33717070	Peptidomes and Structures Illustrate Two Distinguishing Mechanisms of Alternating the Peptide Plasticity Caused by Swine MHC Class I Micropolymorphism. 	Peptidomes of MHC Class I Allotypes Illustrate the Peptide binding Plasticity Leading by Micropolymorphism	MHC class I,Random peptide library,LC-MS/MS,De Novo Sequencing	The micropolymorphism of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) can greatly alter the plasticity of peptide presentation, but elucidating the underlying mechanism remains a challenge. Here we investigated the impact of the micropolymorphism on peptide presentation of swine MHC-I (termed swine leukocyte antigen class I, SLA-I) molecules via immunopeptidomes that were determined by our newly developed random peptide library combined with the mass spectrometry (MS) de novo sequencing method (termed RPLD-MS) and the corresponding crystal structures. The immunopeptidomes of SLA-1*04:01, SLA-1*13:01, and their mutants showed that mutations of residues 156 and 99 could expand and narrow the ranges of peptides presented by SLA-I molecules, respectively. R156A mutation of SLA-1*04:01 altered the charge properties and enlarged the volume size of pocket D, which eliminated the harsh restriction to accommodate the third (P3) anchor residue of the peptide and expanded the peptide binding scope. Compared with 99(Tyr) of SLA-1*0401, 99(Phe) of SLA-1*13:01 could not form a conservative hydrogen bond with the backbone of the P3 residues, leading to fewer changes in the pocket properties but a significant decrease in quantitative of immunopeptidomes. This absent force could be compensated by the salt bridge formed by P1-E and 170(Arg). These data illustrate two distinguishing manners that show how micropolymorphism alters the peptide-binding plasticity of SLA-I alleles, verifying the sensitivity and accuracy of the RPLD-MS method for determining the peptide binding characteristics of MHC-I in vitro and helping to more accurately predict and identify MHC-I restricted epitopes.
PXD024109	33717175	ERAP2 Increases the Abundance of a Peptide Submotif Highly Selective for the Birdshot Uveitis-Associated HLA-A29. 	ERAP2 Increases the Abundance of a Peptide Submotif Highly Selective for the Birdshot Uveitis-Associated HLA-A29	Birdshot, ERAP2, HLA-A29, autoimmunity, immunopeptidome	Birdshot Uveitis (BU) is a blinding inflammatory eye condition that only affects HLA-A29-positive individuals. Genetic association studies linked ERAP2 with BU, an aminopeptidase which trims peptides before their presentation by HLA class I at the cell surface, which suggests that ERAP2-dependent peptide presentation by HLA-A29 drives the pathogenesis of BU. However, it remains poorly understood whether the effects of ERAP2 on the HLA-A29 peptidome are distinct from its effect on other HLA allotypes. To address this, we focused on the effects of ERAP2 on the immunopeptidome in patient-derived antigen presenting cells. Using complementary HLA-A29-based and pan-class I immunopurifications, isotope-labeled naturally processed and presented HLA-bound peptides were sequenced by mass spectrometry. We show that the effects of ERAP2 on the N-terminus of ligands of HLA-A29 are shared across endogenous HLA allotypes, but discover and replicate that one peptide motif generated in the presence of ERAP2 is specifically bound by HLA-A29. This motif can be found in the amino acid sequence of putative autoantigens. We further show evidence for internal sequence specificity for ERAP2 imprinted in the immunopeptidome. These results reveal that ERAP2 can generate an HLA-A29-specific antigen repertoire, which supports that antigen presentation is a key disease pathway in BU.
PXD021383	33717396	Proteomic profiling of commercial dust mite skin prick test solutions and allergy vaccines from India. 	Proteomic Profiling of Commercial Dust Mite Skin Prick Test Solutions and Allergy Vaccines from India	allergens, dust mites, skin prick	BACKGROUND: Skin prick test (SPT) solutions and allergy vaccines (AVs) are crucial tools for diagnosis and therapy of allergies. It was the aim of this study to corroborate the content of products for diagnosis and treatment of dust mite allergies that are produced and sold in India. METHODS: SDS-PAGE, immunoblots and high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis was performed with 16 house dust mite (HDM) SPT solutions and AVs from 3 Indian manufacturers. Authority-approved European SPT solutions and in-house extracts were used as references. RESULTS: From the 5 Indian Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus products, none contained proteins from this source. Instead, 1 sample contained Dermatophagoides farinae and human serum proteins, 4 products contained allergens from the storage mite Suidasia medanensis, allergens from the legume Cicer arietinum (chickpea), and proteins from baker's yeast. From 4 Indian D. farinae-labeled products, 2 contained human serum proteins and a limited number of D. farinae allergens. Two contained only Suidasia, Cicer, and yeast proteins. In contrast, the European authority-approved D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae SPT solutions that were used as reference in this study, contained exclusively proteins of the respective species and covered the expected allergen spectra. The Blomia tropicalis sample contained no Blomia allergens at all, but consisted exclusively of Suidasia, Cicer, and yeast proteins. All 6 HDM samples consisted of human serum proteins and limited amounts of D. farinae allergens. CONCLUSIONS: All commercial Indian SPT solutions and AVs analyzed in this study are not suitable for dust mite allergy diagnosis and therapy, as they contain either no, or only a limited number of, HDM allergens. In addition, their use could lead to misdiagnosis since some of them contain allergens from other sources, including the storage mite Suidasia, chickpea, as well as baker's yeast. Further, their application might be harmful to patients, as some products contain large amounts of proteins of human origin. Analysis of European SPT solutions, on the other hand, confirmed their suitability for dust mite allergy diagnosis.
PXD021260	33717691	iTRAQ-based comparative proteome analyses of different growth stages revealing the regulatory role of reactive oxygen species in the fruiting body development of Ophiocordyceps sinensis. 	Comparative proteome analyses of Ophiocordyceps sinensis at different stages	Ophiocordyceps sinensis, ROS, development, fruiting body	In this study, using an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ ) approach coupled with LC-MS / MS and bioinformatics, the proteomes were analyzed for the crucial three stages covering the fruiting body development of Ophiocordyceps sinensis, including sclerotium (ST), primordium (PR) and mature fruiting body (MF), with a focus on fruiting body development-related proteins and the potential mechanisms of the development. A total of 1,875 proteins were identified. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the protein patterns between PR and MF were more similar than ST. Differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) analysis showed that there were 510, 173 and 514 DAPs in the comparisons of ST vs. PR, PR vs. MF and ST vs. MF, respectively. A total of 62 shared DAPs were identified and primarily enriched in proteins related to 'carbon transport and mechanism', 'the response to oxidative stress', 'antioxidative activity' and 'translation'. KEGG and GO databases showed that the DAPs were enriched in terms of 'primary metabolisms (amino acid/fatty acid/energy metabolism)', 'the response to oxidative stress' and 'peroxidase'. Furthermore, 34 DAPs involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism were identified and clustered across the three stages using hierarchical clustering implemented in hCluster R package . It was suggested that their roles and the underlying mechanisms may be stage-specific. ROS may play a role in fungal pathogenicity in ST, the fruit-body initiation in PR, sexual reproduction and highland adaptation in MF. Crucial ROS-related proteins were identified, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD, T5A6F1), Nor-1 (T5AFX3), electron transport protein (T5AHD1), histidine phosphotransferase (HPt, T5A9Z5) and Glutathione peroxidase (T5A9V1). Besides, the accumulation of ROS at the three stages were assayed using 2,7-dichlorofuorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) stanning. A much stronger ROS accumulation was detected at the stage MF, compared to the stages of PR and ST. Sections of ST and fruit-body part of MF were stained by DCFH-DA and observed under the fluorescencemicroscope, showing ROS was distributed within the conidiospore and ascus. Besides, SOD activity increased across the three stages, while CAT activity has a strong increasement in MF compared to the stages of ST and PR. It was suggested that ROS may act in gradient-dependent manner to regulate the fruiting body development. The coding region sequences of six DAPs were analyzed at mRNA level by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results support the result of DAPs analysis and the proteome sequencing data. Our findings offer the perspective of proteome to understand the biology of fruiting body development and highland adaptation in O. sinensis, which would inform the big industry of this valuable fungus.
PXD020592	33718288	Species-Specific Immunological Reactivities Depend on the Cell-Wall Organization of the Two Aspergillus, Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus. 	Comparison of the rodlet layer proteins of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumiguatus	A. fumigatus, A.flavus, RodA, rodlet layer	Although belong to the same genus, Aspergillus fumigatus is primarily involved in invasive pulmonary infection, whereas Aspergillus flavus is a common cause of superficial infection. In this study, we compared conidia (the infective propagules) of these two Aspergillus species. In immunocompetent mice, intranasal inoculation with conidia of A. flavus resulted in significantly higher inflammatory responses in the lungs compared to mice inoculated with A. fumigatus conidia. In vitro assays revealed that the dormant conidia of A. flavus, unlike A. fumigatus dormant conidia, are immunostimulatory. The conidial surface of A. fumigatus was covered by a rodlet-layer, while that of A. flavus were presented with exposed polysaccharides. A. flavus harbored significantly higher number of proteins in its conidial cell wall compared to A. fumigatus conidia. Notably, beta-1,3-glucan in the A. flavus conidial cell-wall showed significantly higher percentage of branching compared to that of A. fumigatus. The polysaccharides ensemble of A. flavus conidial cell wall stimulated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and conidial cell wall associated proteins specifically stimulated IL-8 secretion from the host immune cells. Furthermore, the two species exhibited different sensitivities to antifungal drugs targeting cell wall polysaccharides, proposing the efficacy of species-specific treatment strategies. Overall, the species-specific organization of the conidial cell wall could be important in establishing infection by the two Aspergillus species.
PXD021098	33720532	Faecal proteomics as a novel method to study mammalian behaviour and physiology. 	Fecal proteomics as a novel method to study mammalian behavior and physiology	Breastfeeding, Diet, Feces, Japanese macaque, Weaning	Mammalian faeces can be collected noninvasively during field research and provide valuable information on the ecology and evolution of the source individuals. Undigested food remains, genome/metagenome, steroid hormones, and stable isotopes obtained from faecal samples provide evidence on diet, host/symbiont genetics, and physiological status of the individuals. However, proteins in mammalian faeces have hardly been studied, which hinders the molecular investigations into the behaviour and physiology of the source individuals. Here, we apply mass spectrometry-based proteomics to faecal samples (n = 10), collected from infant, juvenile, and adult captive Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), to describe the proteomes of the source individual, of the food it consumed, and its intestinal microbes. The results show that faecal proteomics is a useful method to: (i) investigate dietary changes along with breastfeeding and weaning, (ii) reveal the taxonomic and histological origin of the food items consumed, and (iii) estimate physiological status inside intestinal tracts. These types of insights are difficult or impossible to obtain through other molecular approaches. Most mammalian species are facing extinction risk and there is an urgent need to obtain knowledge on their ecology and evolution for better conservation strategy. The faecal proteomics framework we present here is easily applicable to wild settings and other mammalian species, and provides direct evidence of their behaviour and physiology.
PXD023977	33720732	Boosting MS1-only Proteomics with Machine Learning Allows 2000 Protein Identifications in Single-Shot Human Proteome Analysis Using 5 min HPLC Gradient. 	Boosting MS1-only proteomics with machine learning allows 2000 protein identifications in single-shot human proteome analyses using 5-minute HPLC gradients	FAIMS, Fusion Lumos, HeLa, MS1-only, Protein Identification	Proteome-wide analyses rely on tandem mass spectrometry and the extensive separation of proteolytic mixtures. This imposes considerable instrumental time consumption, which is one of the main obstacles in the broader acceptance of proteomics in biomedical and clinical research. Recently, we presented a fast proteomic method termed DirectMS1 based on ultrashort LC gradients as well as MS1-only mass spectra acquisition and data processing. The method allows significant reduction of the proteome-wide analysis time to a few minutes at the depth of quantitative proteome coverage of 1000 proteins at 1% false discovery rate (FDR). In this work, to further increase the capabilities of the DirectMS1 method, we explored the opportunities presented by the recent progress in the machine-learning area and applied the LightGBM decision tree boosting algorithm to the scoring of peptide feature matches when processing MS1 spectra. Furthermore, we integrated the peptide feature identification algorithm of DirectMS1 with the recently introduced peptide retention time prediction utility, DeepLC. Additional approaches to improve the performance of the DirectMS1 method are discussed and demonstrated, such as using FAIMS for gas-phase ion separation. As a result of all improvements to DirectMS1, we succeeded in identifying more than 2000 proteins at 1% FDR from the HeLa cell line in a 5 min gradient LC-FAIMS/MS1 analysis. The data sets generated and analyzed during the current study have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD023977.
PXD012458	33722159	Atg9-centered multi-omics integration reveals new autophagy regulators in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 	Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis reveals a core Atg9 interactome in the regulation of yeast macroautophagy	Atg protein, Atg9, autophagy, interactome, transcriptomics	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Atg9 is an important autophagy-related (Atg) protein, and interacts with hundreds of other proteins. How many Atg9-interacting proteins are involved in macroautophagy/autophagy is unclear. Here, we conducted a multi-omic profiling of Atg9-dependent molecular landscapes during nitrogen starvation-induced autophagy, and identified 290 and 256 genes to be markedly regulated by ATG9 in transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. Unexpectedly, we found most of known Atg proteins and autophagy regulators that interact with Atg9 were not significantly changed in the mRNA or protein level during autophagy. Based on a hypothesis that proteins with similar molecular characteristics might have similar functions, we developed a new method named inference of functional interacting partners (iFIP) to integrate the transcriptomic, proteomic and interactomic data, and predicted 42 Atg9-interacting proteins to be potentially involved in autophagy, including 15 known Atg proteins or autophagy regulators. We validated 2 Atg9-interacting partners, Glo3 and Scs7, to be functional in both bulk and selective autophagy. The mRNA and protein expressions but not subcellular localizations of Glo3 and Scs7 were affected with or without ATG9 during autophagy, whereas the colocalizations of the 2 proteins and Atg9 were markedly enhanced at early stages of the autophagic process. Further analyses demonstrated that Glo3 but not Scs7 regulates the retrograde transport of Atg9 during autophagy. A working model was illustrated to highlight the importance of the Atg9 interactome. Taken together, our study not only provided a powerful method for analyzing the multi-omics data, but also revealed 2 new players that regulate autophagy.Abbreviations: ALP: alkaline phosphatase; Arf1: ADP-ribosylation factor 1; Atg: autophagy-related; Co-IP: co-immunoprecipitation; Cvt: cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting; DEM: differentially expressed mRNA; DEP: differentially expressed protein; DIC: differential interference contrast; E-ratio: enrichment ratio; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ES: enrichment score; FC: fold change; FPKM: fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped; GAP: GTPase-activating protein; GFP: green fluorescent protein; GO: gene ontology; GSEA: gene set enrichment analysis; GST: glutathione S-transferase; HA: hemagglutinin; iFIP: inference of functional interacting partners; KO: knockout; LR: logistic regression; OE: over-expression; PAS: phagophore assembly site; PPI: protein-protein interaction; RFP: red fluorescence protein; RNA-seq: RNA sequencing; RT-PCR: real-time polymerase chain reaction; SCC: Spearman's correlation coefficient; SD-N: synthetic minimal medium lacking nitrogen; THANATOS: The Autophagy, Necrosis, ApopTosis OrchestratorS; Vsn: variance stabilization normalization; WT: wild-type.
PXD016548	33722259	PDX models reflect the proteome landscape of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia but divert in select pathways. 	Global protein analysis of pediatric acute leukemia patients and matched xenografts	N terminome, leukemia, phosphorylation, xenograft	BACKGROUND: Murine xenografts of pediatric leukemia accurately recapitulate genomic aberrations. How this translates to the functional capacity of cells remains unclear. Here, we studied global protein abundance, phosphorylation, and protein maturation by proteolytic processing in 11 pediatric B- and T- cell ALL patients and 19 corresponding xenografts. METHODS: Xenograft models were generated for each pediatric patient leukemia. Mass spectrometry-based methods were used to investigate global protein abundance, protein phosphorylation, and limited proteolysis in paired patient and xenografted pediatric acute B- and T- cell lymphocytic leukemia, as well as in pediatric leukemia cell lines. Targeted next-generation sequencing was utilized to examine genetic abnormalities in patients and in corresponding xenografts. Bioinformatic and statistical analysis were performed to identify functional mechanisms associated with proteins and protein post-translational modifications. RESULTS: Overall, we found xenograft proteomes to be most equivalent with their patient of origin. Protein level differences that stratified disease subtypes at diagnostic and relapse stages were largely recapitulated in xenografts. As expected, PDXs lacked multiple human leukocyte antigens and complement proteins. We found increased expression of cell cycle proteins indicating a high proliferative capacity of xenografted cells. Structural genomic changes and mutations were reflected at the protein level in patients. In contrast, the post-translational modification landscape was shaped by leukemia type and host and only to a limited degree by the patient of origin. Of 201 known pediatric oncogenic drivers and drug-targetable proteins, the KMT2 protein family showed consistently high variability between patient and corresponding xenografts. Comprehensive N terminomics revealed deregulated proteolytic processing in leukemic cells, in particular from caspase-driven cleavages found in patient cells. CONCLUSION: Genomic and host factors shape protein and post-translational modification landscapes differently. This study highlights select areas of diverging biology while confirming murine patient-derived xenografts as a generally accurate model system.
PXD022696	33722654	The distinct N-terminomes of Bothrops jararaca newborn and adult venoms. 	The distinct N-terminomes of Bothrops jararaca newborn and adult venoms.	Bothrops jararaca, N-terminome, TAILS., proteolytic processing, snake venom	Using approaches of transcriptomics and proteomics we have shown that the phenotype of Bothrops jararaca venom undergoes a significant rearrangement upon neonate to adult transition. Most regulatory processes in biology are intrinsically related to modifications of protein structure, function, and abundance. However, it is unclear to which extent intrinsic proteolysis affects toxins and snake venom phenotypes upon ontogenesis. Here we assessed the natural N-terminome of Bothrops jararaca newborn and adult venoms and explored the degree of N-terminal protein truncation in ontogenetic-based proteome variation. To this end we applied the Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) technology to characterize venom collected in the presence of proteinase inhibitors. We identified natural N-terminal sequences in the newborn (71) and adult (84) venoms, from which only 37 were common to both. However, truncated toxins were found in higher number in the newborn (212) than in the adult (140) venom. Moreover, sequences N-terminally blocked by pyroglutamic acid were identified in the newborn (55) and adult (49) venoms. Most toxin classes identified by their natural N-terminal sequences showed a similar number of unique peptides in the newborn and adult venoms, however, those of serine proteinases and C-type lectins were more abundant in the adult venom. Truncated sequences from at least ten toxin classes were detected, however the catalytic and cysteine-rich domains of metalloproteinases were the most prone to proteolysis, mainly in the newborn venom. Our results underscore the pervasiveness of truncations in most toxin classes and highlight variable post-translational events in newborn and adult venoms.
PXD023882	33723432	Peroxisomal-derived ether phospholipids link nucleotides to respirasome assembly. 	Proteomic analysis of U2OS cells treated with the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor Brequinar	Diabetes (B/D-HPP), Human Proteome Project, Nucleotides, ProteomeXchange project tag: Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, mitochondria, pyrimidines, respirasome, supercomplexes	The protein complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain exist in isolation and in higher order assemblies termed supercomplexes (SCs) or respirasomes (SC I+III2+IV). The association of complexes I, III and IV into the respirasome is regulated by unknown mechanisms. Here, we designed a nanoluciferase complementation reporter for complex III and IV proximity to determine in vivo respirasome levels. In a chemical screen, we found that inhibitors of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) potently increased respirasome assembly and activity. By-passing DHODH inhibition via uridine supplementation decreases SC assembly by altering mitochondrial phospholipid composition, specifically elevated peroxisomal-derived ether phospholipids. Cell growth rates upon DHODH inhibition depend on ether lipid synthesis and SC assembly. These data reveal that nucleotide pools signal to peroxisomes to modulate synthesis and transport of ether phospholipids to mitochondria for SC assembly, which are necessary for optimal cell growth in conditions of nucleotide limitation.
PXD024239	33725478	Pleiotropic consequences of metabolic stress for the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule antigen processing and presentation machinery. 	Label-free comparative data dependent (DDA) nanoLC-MS/MS analysis of redox mediated posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in the proteomes from mouse primary dendritic cells (DC) isolated from control B6 and obese (Ob/Ob) mice	bottom-up proteomics on QEHF and Velos Orbitrap, control B6 and Ob/Ob mice dendritic cells	Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are often observed in individuals with type II diabetes (T2D) and related mouse models. One dysmetabolic biochemical consequence is the non-enzymatic reaction between sugars, lipids, and proteins, favoring protein glycation, glycoxidation, and lipoxidation. Here, we identified oxidative alterations in key components of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule antigen processing and presentation machinery in vivo under conditions of hyperglycemia-induced metabolic stress. These modifications were linked to epitope-specific changes in endosomal processing efficiency, MHC class II-peptide binding, and DM editing activity. Moreover, we observed some quantitative and qualitative changes in the MHC class II immunopeptidome of Ob/Ob mice on a high-fat diet compared with controls, including changes in the presentation of an apolipoprotein B100 peptide associated previously with T2D and metabolic syndrome-related clinical complications. These findings highlight a link between glycation reactions and altered MHC class II antigen presentation that may contribute to T2D complications.
PXD023537	33725486	Caspase cleavage releases a nuclear protein fragment that stimulates phospholipid scrambling at the plasma membrane. 	PRM quantification of XRCC4 and Xkr4 peptides that were immunoprecipitated with SPOT-Xkr4-Flag	PRM, SPOT-Trap	Phospholipid scrambling in dying cells promotes phosphatidylserine exposure, a critical process for efferocytosis. We previously identified the Xkr family protein Xkr4 as a phospholipid-scrambling protein, but its activation mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show that Xkr4 is activated in two steps: dimer formation by caspase-mediated cleavage and structural change caused by activating factors. To identify the factors, we developed a new screening system, "revival screening," using a CRISPR sgRNA library. Applying this system, we identified the nuclear protein XRCC4 as the single candidate for the Xkr4 activator. Upon apoptotic stimuli, XRCC4, contained in the DNA repair complex, is cleaved by caspases, and its C-terminal fragment with an intrinsically disordered region is released into the cytoplasm. Protein interaction screening showed that the fragment interacts directly with the Xkr4 dimer to activate it. This study demonstrates that caspase-mediated cleavage releases a nuclear protein fragment for direct regulation of lipid dynamics on the plasma membrane.
PXD016800	33727310	Surface Proteomics Reveals CD72 as a Target for In Vitro-Evolved Nanobody-Based CAR-T Cells in KMT2A/MLL1-Rearranged B-ALL. 	Surface proteomics reveals CD72 as a target for in vitro-evolved nanobody-based CAR-T cells in refractory B-cell malignancies	B-ALL, CD72, cell surface	Alternative strategies are needed for patients with B-cell malignancy relapsing after CD19-targeted immunotherapy. Here, cell surface proteomics revealed CD72 as an optimal target for poor-prognosis KMT2A/MLL1-rearranged (MLLr) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which we further found to be expressed in other B-cell malignancies. Using a recently described, fully in vitro system, we selected synthetic CD72-specific nanobodies, incorporated them into chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), and demonstrated robust activity against B-cell malignancy models, including CD19 loss. Taking advantage of the role of CD72 in inhibiting B-cell receptor signaling, we found that SHIP1 inhibition increased CD72 surface density. We establish that CD72-nanobody CAR-T cells are a promising therapy for MLLr B-ALL. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with MLLr B-ALL have poor prognoses despite recent immunotherapy advances. Here, surface proteomics identifies CD72 as being enriched on MLLr B-ALL but also widely expressed across B-cell cancers. We show that a recently described, fully in vitro nanobody platform generates binders highly active in CAR-T cells and demonstrate its broad applicability for immunotherapy development.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1861.
PXD022327	33727367	Dysregulation of Principal Cell miRNAs Facilitates Epigenetic Regulation of AQP2 and Results in Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus. 	Protein quantification of mouse inner medulla (IM) sections using MS based proteomics -  WT vs. Dicer(AQP2Cre+) mice	AQP2, Dicer, Endoribonuclease, IM	BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), formed by cleavage of pre-microRNA by the endoribonuclease Dicer, are critical modulators of cell function by post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression. METHODS: Selective ablation of Dicer in AQP2-expressing cells (Dicer(AQP2Cre+) mice) was used to investigate the role of miRNAs in the kidney collecting duct of mice. RESULTS: The mice had severe polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, potentially due to greatly reduced AQP2 and AQP4 levels. Although epithelial sodium channel levels were decreased in cortex and increased in inner medulla, amiloride-sensitive sodium reabsorption was equivalent in Dicer(AQP2Cre+) mice and controls. Small-RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis revealed 31 and 178 significantly regulated miRNAs and proteins, respectively. Integrated bioinformatic analysis of the miRNAome and proteome suggested alterations in the epigenetic machinery and various transcription factors regulating AQP2 expression in Dicer(AQP2Cre+) mice. The expression profile and function of three miRNAs (miR-7688-5p, miR-8114, and miR-409-3p) whose predicted targets were involved in epigenetic control (Phf2, Kdm5c, and Kdm4a) or transcriptional regulation (GATA3, GATA2, and ELF3) of AQP2 were validated. Luciferase assays could not demonstrate direct interaction of AQP2 or the three potential transcription factors with miR-7688-5p, miR-8114, and miR-409-3p. However, transfection of respective miRNA mimics reduced AQP2 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated decreased Phf2 and significantly increased Kdm5c interactions at the Aqp2 gene promoter in Dicer(AQP2Cre+) mice, resulting in decreased RNA Pol II association. CONCLUSIONS: Novel evidence indicates miRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation of AQP2 expression.
PXD020320	33727531	Mapping specificity, cleavage entropy, allosteric changes and substrates of blood proteases in a high-throughput screen. 	Target quantification of octapeptide for Thrombin and FX	allostery, blood coagulation proteases, entropy, high-throughput protease screen, specificity, substrates	Proteases are among the largest protein families and critical regulators of biochemical processes like apoptosis and blood coagulation. Knowledge of proteases has been expanded by the development of proteomic approaches, however, technology for multiplexed screening of proteases within native environments is currently lacking behind. Here we introduce a simple method to profile protease activity based on isolation of protease products from native lysates using a 96FASP filter, their analysis in a mass spectrometer and a custom data analysis pipeline. The method is significantly faster, cheaper, technically less demanding, easy to multiplex and produces accurate protease fingerprints. Using the blood cascade proteases as a case study, we obtain protease substrate profiles that can be used to map specificity, cleavage entropy and allosteric effects and to design protease probes. The data further show that protease substrate predictions enable the selection of potential physiological substrates for targeted validation in biochemical assays.
PXD014163	33729478	ALS/FTD-causing mutation in cyclin F causes the dysregulation of SFPQ. 	ALS/FTD-causing mutation in cyclin F causes the dysregulation of SFPQ	BioID, RBM14, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cyclin F, frontotemporal dementia, homeostasis, paraspeckles, ubiquitylation	Previously, we identified missense mutations in CCNF that are causative of familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Hallmark features of these diseases include the build-up of insoluble protein aggregates as well as the mislocalization of proteins such as transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43). In recent years, the dysregulation of SFPQ (splicing factor proline and glutamine rich) has also emerged as a pathological hallmark of ALS/FTD. CCNF encodes for the protein cyclin F, a substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We have previously shown that ALS/FTD-linked mutations in CCNF cause disruptions to overall protein homeostasis that leads to a build-up of K48-linked ubiquitylated proteins as well as defects in autophagic machinery. To investigate further processes that may be affected by cyclin F, we used a protein-proximity ligation method, known as Biotin Identification (BioID), standard immunoprecipitations and mass spectrometry to identify novel interaction partners of cyclin F and infer further process that may be affected by the ALS/FTD-causing mutation. Results demonstrate that cyclin F closely associates with proteins involved with RNA metabolism as well as a number of RNA-binding proteins previously linked to ALS/FTD, including SFPQ. Notably, the overexpression of cyclin F(S621G) led to the aggregation and altered subcellular distribution of SFPQ in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, while leading to altered degradation in primary neurons. Overall, our data links ALS/FTD-causing mutations in CCNF to converging pathological features of ALS/FTD and provides a link between defective protein degradation systems and the pathological accumulation of a protein involved in RNA processing and metabolism.
PXD020176	33731109	Comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identify intracellular targets for myriocin to induce Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum cell death. 	Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum induced by myriocin produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LZN01	myriocin	BACKGROUND: Myriocin is a natural product with antifungal activity and is derived from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LZN01. Our previous work demonstrated that myriocin can inhibit the growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fon) by inducing membrane damage. In this study, the antifungal actions of myriocin against Fon were investigated with a focus on the effects of myriocin on intracellular molecules. RESULTS: Analysis of DNA binding and fluorescence spectra demonstrated that myriocin can interact with dsDNA from Fon cells. The intracellular-targeted mechanism of action was also supported by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses; a total of 2238 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The DEGs were further verified by RT-qPCR. Most of the DEGs were assigned metabolism and genetic information processing functions and were enriched in ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes pathway. The expression of some genes and proteins in ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes pathway was affected by myriocin, primarily the genes controlled by the C6 zinc cluster transcription factor family and the NFYA transcription factor. Myriocin influenced the posttranscriptional processing of gene products by triggering the main RI (retained intron) events of novel alternative splicing; myriocin targeted key genes (FOXG_09470) or proteins (RIOK2) in ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes pathway, resulting in disordered translation. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, myriocin was determined to exhibit activity against Fon by targeting intracellular molecules. The results of our study may help to elucidate the antifungal actions of myriocin against Fon.
PXD023711	33731717	alpha-Catenin levels determine direction of YAP/TAZ response to autophagy perturbation. 	alpha-Catenin Levels Determine Direction of YAP/TAZ Response to Autophagy Perturbation	YAP/TAZ, autophagy, alpha-Catenin	The factors regulating cellular identity are critical for understanding the transition from health to disease and responses to therapies. Recent literature suggests that autophagy compromise may cause opposite effects in different contexts by either activating or inhibiting YAP/TAZ co-transcriptional regulators of the Hippo pathway via unrelated mechanisms. Here, we confirm that autophagy perturbation in different cell types can cause opposite responses in growth-promoting oncogenic YAP/TAZ transcriptional signalling. These apparently contradictory responses can be resolved by a feedback loop where autophagy negatively regulates the levels of alpha-catenins, LC3-interacting proteins that inhibit YAP/TAZ, which, in turn, positively regulate autophagy. High basal levels of alpha-catenins enable autophagy induction to positively regulate YAP/TAZ, while low alpha-catenins cause YAP/TAZ activation upon autophagy inhibition. These data reveal how feedback loops enable post-transcriptional determination of cell identity and how levels of a single intermediary protein can dictate the direction of response to external or internal perturbations.
PXD020018	33731850	Pediatric MDS and bone marrow failure-associated germline mutations in SAMD9 and SAMD9L impair multiple pathways in primary hematopoietic cells. 	Identification of SAMD9 and SAMD9L interactome in HEK293T cells	SAMD9, SAMD9L, pediatric MDS	Pediatric myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous disease group associated with impaired hematopoiesis, bone marrow hypocellularity, and frequently have deletions involving chromosome 7 (monosomy 7). We and others recently identified heterozygous germline mutations in SAMD9 and SAMD9L in children with monosomy 7 and MDS. We previously demonstrated an antiproliferative effect of these gene products in non-hematopoietic cells, which was exacerbated by their patient-associated mutations. Here, we used a lentiviral overexpression approach to assess the functional impact and underlying cellular processes of wild-type and mutant SAMD9 or SAMD9L in primary mouse or human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). Using a combination of protein interactome analyses, transcriptional profiling, and functional validation, we show that SAMD9 and SAMD9L are multifunctional proteins that cause profound alterations in cell cycle, cell proliferation, and protein translation in HSPCs. Importantly, our molecular and functional studies also demonstrated that expression of these genes and their mutations leads to a cellular environment that promotes DNA damage repair defects and ultimately apoptosis in hematopoietic cells. This study provides novel functional insights into SAMD9 and SAMD9L and how their mutations can potentially alter hematopoietic function and lead to bone marrow hypocellularity, a hallmark of pediatric MDS.
PXD022150	33731925	Identification of bacteria-derived HLA-bound peptides in melanoma. 	Identification of microbial-derived HLA-bound peptides in melanoma	HLA peptidomics, immunopeptidomics, microbiome	A variety of species of bacteria are known to colonize human tumours(1-11), proliferate within them and modulate immune function, which ultimately affects the survival of patients with cancer and their responses to treatment(12-14). However, it is not known whether antigens derived from intracellular bacteria are presented by the human leukocyte antigen class I and II (HLA-I and HLA-II, respectively) molecules of tumour cells, or whether such antigens elicit a tumour-infiltrating T cell immune response. Here we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing and HLA peptidomics to identify a peptide repertoire derived from intracellular bacteria that was presented on HLA-I and HLA-II molecules in melanoma tumours. Our analysis of 17 melanoma metastases (derived from 9 patients) revealed 248 and 35 unique HLA-I and HLA-II peptides, respectively, that were derived from 41 species of bacteria. We identified recurrent bacterial peptides in tumours from different patients, as well as in different tumours from the same patient. Our study reveals that peptides derived from intracellular bacteria can be presented by tumour cells and elicit immune reactivity, and thus provides insight into a mechanism by which bacteria influence activation of the immune system and responses to therapy.
PXD022244	33733554	Genetic determinants of seed protein plasticity in response to the environment in Medicago truncatula. 	Medicago truncatula Seed Protein Plasticity in Response to the Environment	Medicago truncatula, climate change, seed development	As the frequency of extreme environmental events is expected to increase with climate change, identifying candidate genes for stabilizing the protein composition of legume seeds or optimizing this in a given environment is increasingly important. To elucidate the genetic determinants of seed protein plasticity, major seed proteins from 200 ecotypes of Medicago truncatula grown in four contrasting environments were quantified after one-dimensional electrophoresis. The plasticity index of these proteins was recorded for each genotype as the slope of Finlay and Wilkinson's regression and then used for genome-wide association studies (GWASs), enabling the identification of candidate genes for determining this plasticity. This list was enriched in genes related to transcription, DNA repair and signal transduction, with many of them being stress responsive. Other over-represented genes were related to sulfur and aspartate family pathways leading to the synthesis of the nutritionally essential amino acids methionine and lysine. By placing these genes in metabolic pathways, and using a M. truncatula mutant impaired in regenerating methionine from S-methylmethionine, we discovered that methionine recycling pathways are major contributors to globulin composition establishment and plasticity. These data provide a unique resource of genes that can be targeted to mitigate negative impacts of environmental stresses on seed protein composition.
PXD020084	33734450	Cryo-EM reveals the complex architecture of dynactin's shoulder region and pointed end. 	Cryo-EM structures of dynactin's shoulder and pointed end show their complex architecture and reveal conserved cargo adaptor binding sites	Dynactin, crosslinking MS	Dynactin is a 1.1 MDa complex that activates the molecular motor dynein for ultra-processive transport along microtubules. In order to do this, it forms a tripartite complex with dynein and a coiled-coil adaptor. Dynactin consists of an actin-related filament whose length is defined by its flexible shoulder domain. Despite previous cryo-EM structures, the molecular architecture of the shoulder and pointed end of the filament is still poorly understood due to the lack of high-resolution information in these regions. Here we combine multiple cryo-EM datasets and define precise masking strategies for particle signal subtraction and 3D classification. This overcomes domain flexibility and results in high-resolution maps into which we can build the shoulder and pointed end. The unique architecture of the shoulder securely houses the p150 subunit and positions the four identical p50 subunits in different conformations to bind dynactin's filament. The pointed end map allows us to build the first structure of p62 and reveals the molecular basis for cargo adaptor binding to different sites at the pointed end.
PXD021984	33735443	Diagnostic biomarkers from proteomic characterization of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with brain malignancies. 	Proteomic characterization of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with brain malignancies	Biomarker, Brain Tumor, Glioblastoma	Recent technological advances in molecular diagnostics through liquid biopsies hold the promise to repetitively monitor tumor evolution and treatment response of brain malignancies without the need of invasive surgical tissue accrual. Here, we implemented a mass spectrometry-based protein analysis pipeline which identified hundreds of proteins in 251 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with four types of brain malignancies (glioblastoma, lymphoma, brain metastasis, and leptomeningeal disease [LMD]) and from healthy individuals with a focus on glioblastoma in a retrospective and confirmatory prospective observational study. CSF proteome deregulation via disruption of the blood brain barrier appeared to be largely conserved across brain tumor entities. CSF analysis of glioblastoma patients identified two proteomic clusters that correlated with tumor size and patient survival. By integrating CSF data with proteomic analyses of matching glioblastoma tumor tissue and primary glioblastoma cells, we identified potential CSF biomarkers for glioblastoma, in particular chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Key findings were validated in a prospective cohort consisting of 35 glioma patients. Finally, in LMD patients who frequently undergo repeated CSF work-up, we explored our proteomic pipeline as a mean to profile consecutive CSF samples. Therefore, proteomic analysis of CSF in brain malignancies has the potential to reveal biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy monitoring.
PXD023203	33735571	Strain-Specific Peptide (SSP) Interference Reference Sample: A Genetically Encoded Quality Control for Isobaric Tagging Strategies. 	Strain-specific peptide (SSP) standard: A genetically encoded quality control standard for isobaric tagging strategies	Eclipse, FAIMS, Founder Strains, RTS-MS3, SPS-MS3, TMTpro16	Isobaric tag-based sample multiplexing strategies are extensively used for global protein abundance profiling. However, such analyses are often confounded by ratio compression resulting from the co-isolation, co-fragmentation, and co-quantification of co-eluting peptides, termed "interference." Recent analytical strategies incorporating ion mobility and real-time database searching have helped to alleviate interference, yet further assessment is needed. Here, we present the strain-specific peptide (SSP) interference reference sample, a tandem mass tag (TMT)pro-labeled quality control that leverages the genetic variation in the proteomes of eight phylogenetically divergent mouse strains. Typically, a peptide with a missense mutation has a different mass and retention time than the reference or native peptide. TMT reporter ion signal for the native peptide in strains that encode the mutant peptide suggests interference which can be quantified and assessed using the interference-free index (IFI). We introduce the SSP by investigating interference in three common data acquisition methods and by showcasing improvements in the IFI when using ion mobility-based gas-phase fractionation. In addition, we provide a user-friendly, online viewer to visualize the data and streamline the calculation of the IFI. The SSP will aid in developing and optimizing isobaric tag-based experiments.
PXD016421	33735912	MARCKS affects cell motility and response to BTK inhibitors in CLL. 	Integrated proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis reveal novel targets and suggest rationale for ibrutinib efficacy in UM-CLL	CLL, phosphoproteomics	Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors are highly active drugs for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To understand the response to BTK inhibitors on a molecular level, we performed (phospho)proteomic analyses under ibrutinib treatment. We identified 3466 proteins and 9184 phosphopeptides (representing 2854 proteins) in CLL cells exhibiting a physiological ratio of phosphorylated serines (pS), threonines (pT), and tyrosines (pY) (pS:pT:pY). Expression of 83 proteins differed between unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) CLL (UM-CLL) and mutated IGHV CLL (M-CLL). Strikingly, UM-CLL cells showed higher basal phosphorylation levels than M-CLL samples. Effects of ibrutinib on protein phosphorylation levels were stronger in UM-CLL, especially on phosphorylated tyrosines. The differentially regulated phosphopeptides and proteins clustered in pathways regulating cell migration, motility, cytoskeleton composition, and survival. One protein, myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS), showed striking differences in expression and phosphorylation level in UM-CLL vs M-CLL. MARCKS sequesters phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, thereby affecting central signaling pathways and clustering of the B-cell receptor (BCR). Genetically induced loss of MARCKS significantly increased AKT signaling and migratory capacity. CD40L stimulation increased expression of MARCKS. BCR stimulation induced phosphorylation of MARCKS, which was reduced by BTK inhibitors. In line with our in vitro findings, low MARCKS expression is associated with significantly higher treatment-induced leukocytosis and more pronounced decrease of nodal disease in patients with CLL treated with acalabrutinib.
PXD018416	33737539	Global miRNA/proteomic analyses identify miRNAs at 14q32 and 3p21, which contribute to features of chronic iron-exposed fallopian tube epithelial cells. 	Global Proteomic Profiling in Chronic Iron-Exposed Fallopian Tube Secretory Epithelial Cells	fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells, ferric ammonium citrate, initiation events, ovarian cancer, proteomic profiling	Malignant transformation of fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FTSECs) is a key contributing event to the development of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Our recent findings implicate oncogenic transformative events in chronic iron-exposed FTSECs, including increased expression of oncogenic mediators, increased telomerase transcripts, and increased growth/migratory potential. Herein, we extend these studies by implementing an integrated transcriptomic and mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify global miRNA and protein alterations, for which we also investigate a subset of these targets to iron-induced functional alterations. Proteomic analysis identified > 4500 proteins, of which 243 targets were differentially expressed. Sixty-five differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 35 were associated with the "top" proteomic molecules (> fourfold change) identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Twenty of these 35 miRNAs are at the 14q32 locus (encoding a cluster of 54 miRNAs) with potential to be regulated by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. At 14q32, miR-432-5p and miR-127-3p were ~ 100-fold downregulated whereas miR-138-5p was 16-fold downregulated at 3p21 in chronic iron-exposed FTSECs. Combinatorial treatment with methyltransferase and deacetylation inhibitors reversed expression of these miRNAs, suggesting chronic iron exposure alters miRNA expression via epigenetic alterations. In addition, PAX8, an important target in HGSOC and a potential miRNA target (from IPA) was epigenetically deregulated in iron-exposed FTSECs. However, both PAX8 and ALDH1A2 (another IPA-predicted target) were experimentally identified to be independently regulated by these miRNAs although TERT RNA was partially regulated by miR-138-5p. Interestingly, overexpression of miR-432-5p diminished cell numbers induced by long-term iron exposure in FTSECs. Collectively, our global profiling approaches uncovered patterns of miRNA and proteomic alterations that may be regulated by genome-wide epigenetic alterations and contribute to functional alterations induced by chronic iron exposure in FTSECs. This study may provide a platform to identify future biomarkers for early ovarian cancer detection and new targets for therapy.
PXD020819	33737719	Global analysis of lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation in wheat root. 	Global analysis of lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation in wheat root	2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, carbohydrate, energy metabolism, post-translational modification, protein metabolism, wheat root	Lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (Khib) is a novel naturally occurring post-translational modification. The system Khib identification at proteomics level has been performed in various species and tissues to characterize the role of Khib in biological activities. However, the study of Khib in plant species is relatively less. In the present study, the first plant root tissues lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylome analysis was performed in wheat with antibody immunoprecipitation affinity, high resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. In total, 6328 Khib sites in 2186 proteins were repeatedly identified in three replicates. These Khib proteins showed a wide subcellular location distribution. Function and pathways characterization of these Khib proteins indicated that many cellular functions and metabolism pathways were potentially affected by this modification. Protein and amino acid metabolism related process may be regulated by Khib, especially ribosome activities and proteins biosynthesis process. Carbohydrate metabolism and energy production related processes including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were also affected by Khib modification. Besides, root sulfur assimilation and transformation related enzymes exhibited Khib modification. Our work illustrated the potential regulation role of Khib in wheat root physiology and biology, which could be used as a useful reference for Khib study in plant root.
PXD022715	33737865	Analysis of Chronic Mild Stress-Induced Hypothalamic Proteome: Identification of Protein Dysregulations Associated With Vulnerability and Resiliency to Depression or Anxiety. 	Hypothalamic proteomics of CMS-treated rats	Hypothalamic, chronic mild stress (CMS), rat	Chronic stress as a known risk factor leads to hyperactivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in both depression and anxiety. However, the stress-induced dysfunction of the HPA axis in these disorders especially the common and unique molecular dysregulations have not been well-explored. Previously, we utilized a chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm to segregate and gain depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups. In this study, we continue to examine the possible protein expression alterations of the hypothalamus as the center of the HPA axis in these three groups by using a proteomic approach. Though isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative analysis, a total of 593 dysregulated proteins were identified. These were potentially associated with vulnerability and adaptability of CMS-caused depression or anxiety and therefore might become novel investigative protein targets. Further independent analysis using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) indicated that 5, 7, and 21 dysregulated proteins were specifically associated with depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and insusceptible groups, respectively, suggesting that the same CMS differently affected the regulation system of the rat hypothalamic proteome. In summary, the current proteomic research on the hypothalamus provided insights into the specific and common molecular basis for the HPA dysfunction mechanisms that underlie resiliency and vulnerability to stress-induced depression or anxiety.
PXD015804	33738458	Targeting immunosuppressive macrophages overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA1-associated triple-negative breast cancer. 	Targeting immunosuppressive macrophages overcomes PARP-inhibitor resistance in BRCA1-associated triple-negative breast cancer	Lumos, PARP, TAM (tumor associated macrophage), TMT	Despite objective responses to PARP inhibition and improvements in progression-free survival compared to standard chemotherapy in patients with BRCA-associated triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), benefits are transitory. Using high dimensional single-cell profiling of human TNBC, here we demonstrate that macrophages are the predominant infiltrating immune cell type in BRCA-associated TNBC. Through multi-omics profiling we show that PARP inhibitors enhance both anti- and pro-tumor features of macrophages through glucose and lipid metabolic reprogramming driven by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) pathway. Combined PARP inhibitor therapy with CSF-1R blocking antibodies significantly enhanced innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity and extends survival in BRCA-deficient tumors in vivo and is mediated by CD8(+) T-cells. Collectively, our results uncover macrophage-mediated immune suppression as a liability of PARP inhibitor treatment and demonstrate combined PARP inhibition and macrophage targeting therapy induces a durable reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment, thus constituting a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC.
PXD024172	33739466	Histone chaperone CAF-1 promotes HIV-1 latency by leading the formation of phase-separated suppressive nuclear bodies. 	CAF-1 promotes HIV-1 latency by leading the formation of phase-separated suppressive nuclear bodies	CAF-1	HIV-1 latency is a major obstacle to achieving a functional cure for AIDS. Reactivation of HIV-1-infected cells followed by their elimination via immune surveillance is one proposed strategy for eradicating the viral reservoir. However, current latency-reversing agents (LRAs) show high toxicity and low efficiency, and new targets are needed to develop more promising LRAs. Here, we found that the histone chaperone CAF-1 (chromatin assembly factor 1) is enriched on the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and forms nuclear bodies with liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) properties. CAF-1 recruits epigenetic modifiers and histone chaperones to the nuclear bodies to establish and maintain HIV-1 latency in different latency models and primary CD4(+) T cells. Three disordered regions of the CHAF1A subunit are important for phase-separated CAF-1 nuclear body formation and play a key role in maintaining HIV-1 latency. Disruption of phase-separated CAF-1 bodies could be a potential strategy to reactivate latent HIV-1.
PXD014131	33739838	Influence of Proteome Profiles and Intracellular Drug Exposure on Differences in CYP Activity in Donor-Matched Human Liver Microsomes and Hepatocytes. 	Human liver homogenate, liver microsomes, low-speed centrifugation pellet  and hepatocytes LC-MS/MS from 15 matched donors	Hepatocytes, Liver, Liver microsomes, Low-speed centrifugation pellet	Human liver microsomes (HLM) and human hepatocytes (HH) are important in vitro systems for studies of intrinsic drug clearance (CLint) in the liver. However, the CLint values are often in disagreement for these two systems. Here, we investigated these differences in a side-by-side comparison of drug metabolism in HLM and HH prepared from 15 matched donors. Protein expression and intracellular unbound drug concentration (Kpuu) effects on the CLint were investigated for five prototypical probe substrates (bupropion-CYP2B6, diclofenac-CYP2C9, omeprazole-CYP2C19, bufuralol-CYP2D6, and midazolam-CYP3A4). The samples were donor-matched to compensate for inter-individual variability but still showed systematic differences in CLint. Global proteomics analysis outlined differences in HLM from HH and homogenates of human liver (HL), indicating variable enrichment of ER-localized cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in the HLM preparation. This suggests that the HLM may not equally and accurately capture metabolic capacity for all CYPs. Scaling CLint with CYP amounts and Kpuu could only partly explain the discordance in absolute values of CLint for the five substrates. Nevertheless, scaling with CYP amounts improved the agreement in rank order for the majority of the substrates. Other factors, such as contribution of additional enzymes and variability in the proportions of active and inactive CYP enzymes in HLM and HH, may have to be considered to avoid the use of empirical scaling factors for prediction of drug metabolism.
PXD018543	33740418	Atypical acute myeloid leukemia-specific transcripts generate shared and immunogenic MHC class-I-associated epitopes. 	LC-MSMS of primary AML class I immunopeptidome (differential k-mer expression approach)	AML, MHC class I, immunopeptidome	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not benefited from innovative immunotherapies, mainly because of the lack of actionable immune targets. Using an original proteogenomic approach, we analyzed the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I)-associated immunopeptidome of 19 primary AML samples and identified 58 tumor-specific antigens (TSAs). These TSAs bore no mutations and derived mainly (86%) from supposedly non-coding genomic regions. Two AML-specific aberrations were instrumental in the biogenesis of TSAs, intron retention, and epigenetic changes. Indeed, 48% of TSAs resulted from intron retention and translation, and their RNA expression correlated with mutations of epigenetic modifiers (e.g., DNMT3A). AML TSA-coding transcripts were highly shared among patients and were expressed in both blasts and leukemic stem cells. In AML patients, the predicted number of TSAs correlated with spontaneous expansion of cognate T cell receptor clonotypes, accumulation of activated cytotoxic T cells, immunoediting, and improved survival. These TSAs represent attractive targets for AML immunotherapy.
PXD024022	33741926	Red blood cell mannoses as phagocytic ligands mediating both sickle cell anaemia and malaria resistance. 	High mannose N-glycans on red blood cells as phagocytic ligands, mediating both sickle cell anaemia and resistance to malaria	Malaria, Sickle cells, red blood cells	In both sickle cell disease and malaria, red blood cells (RBCs) are phagocytosed in the spleen, but receptor-ligand pairs mediating uptake have not been identified. Here, we report that patches of high mannose N-glycans (Man5-9GlcNAc2), expressed on diseased or oxidized RBC surfaces, bind the mannose receptor (CD206) on phagocytes to mediate clearance. We find that extravascular hemolysis in sickle cell disease correlates with high mannose glycan levels on RBCs. Furthermore, Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs expose surface mannose N-glycans, which occur at significantly higher levels on infected RBCs from sickle cell trait subjects compared to those lacking hemoglobin S. The glycans are associated with high molecular weight complexes and protease-resistant, lower molecular weight fragments containing spectrin. Recognition of surface N-linked high mannose glycans as a response to cellular stress is a molecular mechanism common to both the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease and resistance to severe malaria in sickle cell trait.
PXD022888	33741971	Dietary restriction transforms the mammalian protein persulfidome in a tissue-specific and cystathionine gamma-lyase-dependent manner. 	Dietary restriction transforms the mammalian protein sulfhydrome in a tissue-specific and cystathionine gamma-lyase-dependent manner	CSE, CTH), biotin thiol assay (BTA), cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL, cysteine, dietary restriction (DR), every other day (EOD) fasting, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), longevity, persulfidation, redox metabolism, sulfhydration, sulfhydrome	Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a cytoprotective redox-active metabolite that signals through protein persulfidation (R-SSnH). Despite the known importance of persulfidation, tissue-specific persulfidome profiles and their associated functions are not well characterized, specifically under conditions and interventions known to modulate H2S production. We hypothesize that dietary restriction (DR), which increases lifespan and can boost H2S production, expands tissue-specific persulfidomes. Here, we find protein persulfidation enriched in liver, kidney, muscle, and brain but decreased in heart of young and aged male mice under two forms of DR, with DR promoting persulfidation in numerous metabolic and aging-related pathways. Mice lacking cystathionine gamma-lyase (CGL) have overall decreased tissue protein persulfidation numbers and fail to functionally augment persulfidomes in response to DR, predominantly in kidney, muscle, and brain. Here, we define tissue- and CGL-dependent persulfidomes and how diet transforms their makeup, underscoring the breadth for DR and H2S to impact biological processes and organismal health.
PXD022247	33742350	Sca1(+) Progenitor Cells (Ex vivo) Exhibits Differential Proteomic Signatures From the Culture Adapted Sca1(+) Cells (In vitro), Both Isolated From Murine Skeletal Muscle Tissue. 	Proteomic profiling of FAC-sorted ex vivo and in vitro expanded Sca-1+cells derived from murine skeletal muscle	Stem Cell Antigen-1 (Sca-1), cell therapy, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, regenerative stem cells, stem cells proteomics	Stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein that is expressed in a sub-population of muscle stem and progenitor cell types. Reportedly, Sca-1 regulates the myogenic property of myoblasts and Sca-1(-/-) mice exhibited defective muscle regeneration. Although the role of Sca-1 in muscle development and maintenance is well-acknowledged, molecular composition of muscle derived Sca-1(+) cells is not characterized. Here, we applied a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based workflow to characterize the proteomic landscape of mouse hindlimb skeletal muscle derived Sca-1(+) cells. Furthermore, we characterized the impact of the cellular microenvironments on the proteomes of Sca-1(+) cells. The proteome component of freshly isolated Sca-1(+) cells (ex vivo) was compared with that of Sca-1(+) cells expanded in cell culture (in vitro). The analysis revealed significant differences in the protein abundances in the two conditions reflective of their functional variations. The identified proteins were enriched in various biological pathways. Notably, we identified proteins related to myotube differentiation, myotube cell development and myoblast fusion. We also identified a panel of cell surface marker proteins that can be leveraged in future to enrich Sca-1(+) cells using combinatorial strategies. Comparative analysis implicated the activation of various pathways leading to increased protein synthesis under in vitro condition. We report here the most comprehensive proteome map of Sca-1(+) cells that provides insights into the molecular networks operative in Sca-1(+) cells. Importantly, through our work we generated the proteomic blueprint of protein abundances significantly altered in Sca-1(+) cells under ex vivo and in vitro conditions. The curated data can also be visualized at https://yenepoya.res.in/database/Sca-1-Proteomics .
PXD021109	33743194	Global phosphoproteomics pinpoints uncharted Gcn2-mediated mechanisms of translational control. 	Global Phosphoproteomics Pinpoints Uncharted Gcn2-Mediated Modes of Translational Control	phosphoproteomics, rapamycin, translation	The conserved Gcn2 protein kinase mediates cellular adaptations to amino acid limitation through translational control of gene expression that is exclusively executed by phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). Using quantitative phosphoproteomics, however, we discovered that Gcn2 targets auxiliary effectors to modulate translation. Accordingly, Gcn2 also phosphorylates the beta-subunit of the trimeric eIF2 G protein complex to promote its association with eIF5, which prevents spontaneous nucleotide exchange on eIF2 and thereby restricts the recycling of the initiator methionyl-tRNA-bound eIF2-GDP ternary complex in amino-acid-starved cells. This mechanism contributes to the inhibition of translation initiation in parallel to the sequestration of the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B by phosphorylated eIF2alpha. Gcn2 further phosphorylates Gcn20 to antagonize, in an inhibitory feedback loop, the formation of the Gcn2-stimulatory Gcn1-Gcn20 complex. Thus, Gcn2 plays a substantially more intricate role in controlling translation initiation than hitherto appreciated.
PXD021562	33743824	Cooperative treatment effectiveness of ATR and HSP90 inhibition in Ewing's sarcoma cells. 	Cooperative treatment effectiveness of VE821 and AUY922 in Ewing's sarcoma cells	Ewings sarcoma	INTRODUCTION: Ewing's sarcoma is an aggressive childhood malignancy whose outcome has not substantially improved over the last two decades. In this study, combination treatments of the HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 with either the ATR inhibitor VE821 or the ATM inhibitor KU55933 were investigated for their effectiveness in Ewing's sarcoma cells. METHODS: Effects were determined in p53 wild-type and p53 null Ewing's sarcoma cell lines by flow cytometric analyses of cell death, mitochondrial depolarization and cell-cycle distribution as well as fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. They were molecularly characterized by gene and protein expression profiling, and by quantitative whole proteome analysis. RESULTS: AUY922 alone induced DNA damage, apoptosis and ER stress, while reducing the abundance of DNA repair proteins. The combination of AUY922 with VE821 led to strong apoptosis induction independent of the cellular p53 status, yet based on different molecular mechanisms. p53 wild-type cells activated pro-apoptotic gene transcription and underwent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, while p53 null cells accumulated higher levels of DNA damage, ER stress and autophagy, eventually leading to apoptosis. Impaired PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling further contributed to the antineoplastic combination effects of AUY922 and VE821. In contrast, the combination of AUY922 with KU55933 did not produce a cooperative effect. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that HSP90 and ATR inhibitor combination treatment may be an effective therapeutic approach for Ewing's sarcoma irrespective of the p53 status.
PXD022364	33744286	Glucocorticoid receptor Thr524 phosphorylation by MINK1 induces interactions with 14-3-3 protein regulators. 	In vitro phosphorylated GR LBD LC-MSMS	Glucocorticoid Receptor, In vitro phosphorylation, Ligand Binding Domain, MAP4K4, MINK1, MST1, MST2, ROCK1	The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that plays a central role in inflammation. The GR activity is also modulated via protein-protein interactions, including binding of 14-3-3 proteins induced by GR phosphorylation. However, the specific phosphorylation sites on the GR that trigger these interactions and their functional consequences are less clear. Hence, we sought to examine this system in more detail. We used phosphorylated GR peptides, biophysical studies, and X-ray crystallography to identify key residues within the ligand-binding domain of the GR, T524 and S617, whose phosphorylation results in binding of the representative 14-3-3 protein 14-3-3zeta. A kinase screen identified misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1) as responsible for phosphorylating T524 and Rho-associated protein kinase 1 for phosphorylating S617; cell-based approaches confirmed the importance of both GR phosphosites and MINK1 but not Rho-associated protein kinase 1 alone in inducing GR-14-3-3 binding. Together our results provide molecular-level insight into 14-3-3-mediated regulation of the GR and highlight both MINK1 and the GR-14-3-3 axis as potential targets for future therapeutic intervention.
PXD022786	33746922	Comparative Analysis of Outer Membrane Vesicle Isolation Methods With an Escherichia coli tolA Mutant Reveals a Hypervesiculating Phenotype With Outer-Inner Membrane Vesicle Content. 	Proteomic analysis of outer membrane vesicle isolation methods with an Escherichia coli tolA mutant using LC MSMS	Escherichia coli, OMV, TolA	Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by Gram-negative bacteria are mediators of cell survival and pathogenesis by facilitating virulence factor dissemination and resistance to antimicrobials. Studies of OMV properties often focus on hypervesiculating Escherichia coli mutants that have increased OMV production when compared to their corresponding wild-type (WT) strains. Currently, two conventional techniques, ultracentrifugation (UC) and ultradiafiltration (UF), are used interchangeably to isolate OMVs, however, there is concern that each technique may inadvertently alter the properties of isolated OMVs during study. To address this concern, we compared two OMV isolation methods, UC and UF, with respect to final OMV quantities, size distributions, and morphologies using a hypervesiculating Escherichia coli K-12 DeltatolA mutant. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) indicated that UC techniques result in lower vesicle yields compared to UF. However, UF permitted isolation of OMVs with smaller average sizes than UC, highlighting a potential OMV isolation size bias by each technique. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) visualization of isolated OMVs revealed distinct morphological differences between WT and DeltatolA OMVs, where DeltatolA OMVs isolated by either UC or UF method possessed a greater proportion of OMVs with two or more membranes. Proteomic OMV analysis of WT and DeltatolA OMVs confirmed that DeltatolA enhances inner plasma membrane carryover in multi-lamellar OMVs. This study demonstrates that UC and UF are useful techniques for OMV isolation, where UF may be preferable due to faster isolation, higher OMV yields and enrichment of smaller sized vesicles.
PXD019713	33747727	Avidity-Based Selection of Tissue-Specific CAR-T Cells from a Combinatorial Cellular Library of CARs. 	DSSO,Xlink,LC-MSMS - DSSO as linker, study of protein-protein interaction by LC-MSMS	DSSO as linker, study of protein-protein interaction by LC-MSMS	Using T-cell chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-T) to activate and redirect T cells to tumors expressing the cognate antigen represents a powerful approach in cancer therapy. However, normal tissues with low expression of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can be mistargeted, resulting in severe side effects. An approach using a collection of T cells expressing a diverse, 10(6)-member combinatorial cellular library of CARs, in which members can be specifically enriched based on avidity for cell membrane antigens, is reported. Using CD38 as the target antigen, an efficient and effective selection of CARs specifically recognizing CD38(+) tumor cells is demonstrated. These selected CAR-T's produce cytokines known to be associated with T cell activation in a CD38 expression-dependent manner. This avidity-based selection endows the engineered T cells with minimal off-tumor effects, while retaining robust antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. The described method may facilitate the application of CAR-T therapy to TAAs previously considered undruggable.
PXD023344	33748143	Multi-Omics Analysis of Anlotinib in Pancreatic Cancer and Development of an Anlotinib-Related Prognostic Signature. 	Pancreatic cancer cells treated with anlotinib	Pancreatic cancer, anlotinib	Aberrant regulation of angiogenesis involves in the growth and metastasis of tumors, but angiogenesis inhibitors fail to improve overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients in previous phase III clinical trials. A comprehensive knowledge of the mechanism of angiogenesis inhibitors against pancreatic cancer is helpful for clinical purpose and for the selection of patients who might benefit from the inhibitors. In this work, multi-omics analyses (transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics profiling) were carried out to delineate the mechanism of anlotinib, a novel angiogenesis inhibitor, against pancreatic cancer cells. The results showed that anlotinib exerted noteworthy cytotoxicity on pancreatic cancer cells. Multi-omics analyses revealed that anlotinib had a profound inhibitory effect on ribosome, and regulated cell cycle, RNA metabolism and lysosome. Based on the multi-omics results and available data deposited in public databases, an anlotinib-related gene signature was further constructed to identify a subgroup of pancreatic cancer patients who had a dismal prognosis and might be responsive to anlotinib.
PXD022716	33748626	Mapping Novel Biomarkers of Liver Injury by Tissue Proteomic Analysis. 	Mapping novel biomarkers of liver injury by tissue proteomic analysis	ABCC6, G3BP, biomarker, liver injury	Liver damage is a dynamic process, and evaluation of liver injury degree is the key step in disease diagnosis. However, few common markers among different types of liver injury have been reported. Herein, we generated three liver injury mouse models, including Con A-induced, CCl4-injected, and subjected bile duct ligation mouse models, to simulate different types of liver damage in humans and then performed a label-free mass spectrometry to identify differentially expressed proteins in liver tissues. Interestingly, two proteins, G3BP and ABCC6, were conserved regulated in different liver injury models and are proposed to be biomarkers in liver injury, with G3BP upregulated and ABCC6 downregulated. Overall, our study identified two novel biomarkers of liver injury, and they might be used as potential drug targets of liver damage research studies.
PXD020656	33748705	Trans-omic analysis reveals obesity-associated dysregulation of inter-organ metabolic cycles between the liver and skeletal muscle. 	Proteome analysis of mouse liver and skeletal muscle	liver, skeletal muscle	Systemic metabolic homeostasis is regulated by inter-organ metabolic cycles involving multiple organs. Obesity impairs inter-organ metabolic cycles, resulting in metabolic diseases. The systemic landscape of dysregulated inter-organ metabolic cycles in obesity has yet to be explored. Here, we measured the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome in the liver and skeletal muscle and the metabolome in blood of fasted wild-type and leptin-deficient obese (ob/ob) mice, identifying components with differential abundance and differential regulation in ob/ob mice. By constructing and evaluating the trans-omic network controlling the differences in metabolic reactions between fasted wild-type and ob/ob mice, we provided potential mechanisms of the obesity-associated dysfunctions of metabolic cycles between liver and skeletal muscle involving glucose-alanine, glucose-lactate, and ketone bodies. Our study revealed obesity-associated systemic pathological mechanisms of dysfunction of inter-organ metabolic cycles.
PXD019827	33749263	Discovery of Protein Modifications Using Differential Tandem Mass Spectrometry Proteomics. 	Synthetic fluoro peptides in neat solvent and complex proteome background	LC-MSMS fluorination modifications PTM Orbitrap Fusion	Recent studies have revealed diverse amino acid, post-translational, and noncanonical modifications of proteins in diverse organisms and tissues. However, their unbiased detection and analysis remain hindered by technical limitations. Here, we present a spectral alignment method for the identification of protein modifications using high-resolution mass spectrometry proteomics. Termed SAMPEI for spectral alignment-based modified peptide identification, this open-source algorithm is designed for the discovery of functional protein and peptide signaling modifications, without prior knowledge of their identities. Using synthetic standards and controlled chemical labeling experiments, we demonstrate its high specificity and sensitivity for the discovery of substoichiometric protein modifications in complex cellular extracts. SAMPEI mapping of mouse macrophage differentiation revealed diverse post-translational protein modifications, including distinct forms of cysteine itaconatylation. SAMPEI's robust parametrization and versatility are expected to facilitate the discovery of biological modifications of diverse macromolecules.

Capillary Zone Electrophoresis-Electron-Capture Collision-Induced Dissociation on a Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer for Top-Down Characterization of Intact Proteins	Capillary Zone Electrophoresis, Electron-Capture Collision-Induced Dissociation, Top-down	Mass spectrometry (MS)-based denaturing top-down proteomics (dTDP) requires high-capacity separation and extensive gas-phase fragmentation of proteoforms. Herein, we coupled capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) to electron-capture collision-induced dissociation (ECciD) on an Agilent 6545 XT quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer for dTDP for the first time. During ECciD, the protein ions were first fragmented using ECD, followed by further activation and fragmentation by applying a CID potential. In this pilot study, we optimized the CZE-ECciD method for small proteins (lower than 20 kDa) regarding the charge state of protein parent ions for fragmentation and the CID potential applied to maximize the protein backbone cleavage coverage and the number of sequence-informative fragment ions. The CZE-ECciD Q-TOF platform provided extensive backbone cleavage coverage for three standard proteins lower than 20 kDa from only single charge states in a single CZE-MS/MS run in the targeted MS/MS mode, including ubiquitin (97%, +7, 8.6 kDa), superoxide dismutase (SOD, 87%, +17, 16 kDa), and myoglobin (90%, +16, 17 kDa). The CZE-ECciD method produced comparable cleavage coverage of small proteins (i.e., myoglobin) with direct-infusion MS studies using electron transfer dissociation (ETD), activated ion-ETD, and combinations of ETD and collision-based fragmentation on high-end orbitrap mass spectrometers. The results render CZE-ECciD a new tool for dTDP to enhance both separation and gas-phase fragmentation of proteoforms.
PXD019342	33749590	Genetic disruption of WASHC4 drives endo-lysosomal dysfunction and cognitive-movement impairments in mice and humans. 	BioID2-Synapsin proteome Soderling	BioID Synapsin	Mutation of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homology (WASH) complex subunit, SWIP, is implicated in human intellectual disability, but the cellular etiology of this association is unknown. We identify the neuronal WASH complex proteome, revealing a network of endosomal proteins. To uncover how dysfunction of endosomal SWIP leads to disease, we generate a mouse model of the human WASHC4(c.3056C>G) mutation. Quantitative spatial proteomics analysis of SWIP(P1019R) mouse brain reveals that this mutation destabilizes the WASH complex and uncovers significant perturbations in both endosomal and lysosomal pathways. Cellular and histological analyses confirm that SWIP(P1019R) results in endo-lysosomal disruption and uncover indicators of neurodegeneration. We find that SWIP(P1019R) not only impacts cognition, but also causes significant progressive motor deficits in mice. A retrospective analysis of SWIP(P1019R) patients reveals similar movement deficits in humans. Combined, these findings support the model that WASH complex destabilization, resulting from SWIP(P1019R), drives cognitive and motor impairments via endo-lysosomal dysfunction in the brain.
PXD018806	33749723	Multi-OMICS study of a CHCHD10 variant causing ALS demonstrates metabolic rewiring and activation of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial unfolded protein responses. 	Tandem Mass Tag proteomics in CHCHD10 patient cells	Fibroblasts, galactose, mitochondria	Mutations in CHCHD10, coding for a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, are a rare cause of autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mutation-specific toxic gain of function or haploinsufficiency models have been proposed to explain pathogenicity. To decipher the metabolic dysfunction associated with the haploinsufficient p.R15L variant, we integrated transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic data sets in patient cells subjected to an energetic stress that forces the cells to rely on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production. Patient cells had a complex I deficiency that resulted in an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio, diminished TCA cycle activity, a reorganization of one carbon metabolism and an increased AMP/ATP ratio leading to phosphorylation of AMPK and inhibition of mTORC1. These metabolic changes activated the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the ER through the IRE1/XBP1 pathway, upregulating downstream targets including ATF3, ATF4, CHOP and EGLN3, and two cytokine markers of mitochondrial disease, GDF15 and FGF21. Activation of the mitochondrial UPR was mediated through an upregulation of the transcription factors ATF4 and ATF5, leading to increased expression of mitochondrial proteases and heat shock proteins. There was a striking transcriptional up regulation of at least seven dual specific phosphatases, associated with an almost complete dephosphorylation of JNK isoforms, suggesting a concerted deactivation of MAP kinase pathways. This study demonstrates that loss of CHCHD10 function elicits an energy deficit that activates unique responses to nutrient stress in both the mitochondria and ER, which may contribute to the selective vulnerability of motor neurons.
PXD024548	33750427	Focal adhesion kinase inhibition synergizes with nab-paclitaxel to target pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. 	Focal adhesion kinase inhibition synergizes with nab-paclitaxel to target pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	EPHA2, FAK, MET, Pancreatic cancer, phosphoproteomics, single-shot, therapy	BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a very lethal disease, with minimal therapeutic options. Aberrant tyrosine kinase activity influences tumor growth and is regulated by phosphorylation. We investigated phosphorylated kinases as target in PDAC. METHODS: Mass spectrometry-based phosphotyrosine proteomic analysis on PDAC cell lines was used to evaluate active kinases. Pathway analysis and inferred kinase activity analysis was performed to identify novel targets. Subsequently, we investigated targeting of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in vitro with drug perturbations in combination with chemotherapeutics used against PDAC. Tyrosine phosphoproteomics upon treatment was performed to evaluate signaling. An orthotopic model of PDAC was used to evaluate the combination of defactinib with nab-paclitaxel. RESULTS: PDAC cell lines portrayed high activity of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases to various degree. The non-receptor kinase, FAK, was identified in all cell lines by our phosphotyrosine proteomic screen and pathway analysis. Targeting of this kinase with defactinib validated reduced phosphorylation profiles. Additionally, FAK inhibition had anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects. Combination with (nab-)paclitaxel had a synergistic effect on cell proliferation in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows high phosphorylation of several oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases in PDAC cells and validated FAK inhibition as potential synergistic target with Nab-paclitaxel against this devastating disease.
PXD021323	33751108	miR-15a/16-1 deletion in activated B cells promotes plasma cell and mature B-cell neoplasms. 	Deletion of miR-15a/16-1 in murine germinal center B-cells.	B-cell, germinal center	Chromosome 13q deletion [del(13q)], harboring the miR-15a/16-1 cluster, is one of the most common genetic alterations in mature B-cell malignancies, which originate from germinal center (GC) and post-GC B cells. Moreover, miR-15a/16 expression is frequently reduced in lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM) cells without del(13q), suggesting important tumor-suppressor activity. However, the role of miR-15a/16-1 in B-cell activation and initiation of mature B-cell neoplasms remains to be determined. We show that conditional deletion of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster in murine GC B cells induces moderate but widespread molecular and functional changes including an increased number of GC B cells, percentage of dark zone B cells, and maturation into plasma cells. With time, this leads to development of mature B-cell neoplasms resembling human extramedullary plasmacytoma (EP) as well as follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. The indolent nature and lack of bone marrow involvement of EP in our murine model resembles human primary EP rather than MM that has progressed to extramedullary disease. We corroborate human primary EP having low levels of miR-15a/16 expression, with del(13q) being the most common genetic loss. Additionally, we show that, although the mutational profile of human EP is similar to MM, there are some exceptions such as the low frequency of hyperdiploidy in EP, which could account for different disease presentation. Taken together, our studies highlight the significant role of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster in the regulation of the GC reaction and its fundamental context-dependent tumor-suppression function in plasma cell and B-cell malignancies.
PXD022361	33752330	Use of a Recombinant Biomarker Protein DDA Library Increases DIA Coverage of Low Abundance Plasma Proteins. 	Recombinant SWATH library for identification of low abundant human plasma proteins	Plasma Proteome, Recombinant Protein, SWATH	Credible detection and quantification of low abundance proteins from human blood plasma is a major challenge in precision medicine biomarker discovery when using mass spectrometry (MS). In this proof-of-concept study, we employed a mixture of selected recombinant proteins in DDA libraries to subsequently identify (not quantify) cancer-associated low abundance plasma proteins using SWATH/DIA. The exemplar DDA recombinant protein spectral library (rPSL) was derived from tryptic digestion of 36 recombinant human proteins that had been previously implicated as possible cancer biomarkers from both our own and other studies. The rPSL was then used to identify proteins from nondepleted colorectal cancer (CRC) EDTA plasmas by SWATH-MS. Most (32/36) of the proteins used in the rPSL were reliably identified from CRC plasma samples, including 8 proteins (i.e., BTC, CXCL10, IL1B, IL6, ITGB6, TGFalpha, TNF, TP53) not previously detected using high-stringency protein inference MS according to PeptideAtlas. The rPSL SWATH-MS protocol was compared to DDA-MS using MARS-depleted and postdigestion peptide fractionated plasmas (here referred to as a human plasma DDA library). Of the 32 proteins identified using rPSL SWATH, only 12 could be identified using DDA-MS. The 20 additional proteins exclusively identified using the rPSL SWATH approach were almost exclusively lower abundance (i.e., <10 ng/mL) proteins. To mitigate justified FDR concerns, and to replicate a more typical library creation approach, the DDA rPSL library was merged with a human plasma DDA library and SWATH identification repeated using such a merged library. The majority (33/36) of the low abundance plasma proteins added from the rPSL were still able to be identified using such a merged library when high-stringency HPP Guidelines v3.0 protein inference criteria were applied to our data set. The MS data set has been deposited to ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (PXD022361).
PXD019707	33752740	Revealing taxon-specific heavy metal-resistance mechanisms in denitrifying phosphorus removal sludge using genome-centric metaproteomics. 	Denitrifying phosphorus removal sludge with heavy metals	heavy metal, sludge	BACKGROUND: Denitrifying phosphorus removal sludge (DPRS) is widely adopted for nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment but faces threats from heavy metals. However, a lack of understanding of the taxon-specific heavy metal-resistance mechanisms hinders the targeted optimization of DPRS's robustness in nutrient removal. RESULTS: We obtained 403 high- or medium-quality metagenome-assembled genomes from DPRS treated by elevating cadmium, nickel, and chromium pressure. Then, the proteomic responses of individual taxa under heavy metal pressures were characterized, with an emphasis on functions involving heavy metal resistance and maintenance of nutrient metabolism. When oxygen availability was constrained by high-concentration heavy metals, comammox Nitrospira overproduced highly oxygen-affinitive hemoglobin and electron-transporting cytochrome c-like proteins, underpinning its ability to enhance oxygen acquisition and utilization. In contrast, Nitrosomonas overexpressed ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite reductase to facilitate the partial nitrification and denitrification process for maintaining nitrogen removal. Comparisons between phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) demonstrated different heavy metal-resistance mechanisms adopted by Dechloromonas and Candidatus Accumulibacter, despite their high genomic similarities. In particular, Dechloromonas outcompeted the canonical PAO Candidatus Accumulibacter in synthesizing polyphosphate, a potential public good for heavy metal detoxification. The superiority of Dechloromonas in energy utilization, radical elimination, and damaged cell component repair also contributed to its dominance under heavy metal pressures. Moreover, the enrichment analysis revealed that functions involved in extracellular polymeric substance formation, siderophore activity, and heavy metal efflux were significantly overexpressed due to the related activities of specific taxa. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that heavy metal-resistance mechanisms within a multipartite community are highly heterogeneous between different taxa. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how the heterogeneity of individual microorganisms contributes to the metabolic versatility and robustness of microbiomes inhabiting dynamic environments, which is vital for manipulating the adaptation of microbial assemblages under adverse environmental stimuli.

PXD020170	33753485	Assembly of a dsRNA synthesizing complex: RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 contacts the largest subunit of NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE IV. 	Pol IV-RDR2 protein interaction study	RNA directed DNA methylation, RNA polymerase, dsRNA, siRNA	In plants, transcription of selfish genetic elements such as transposons and DNA viruses is suppressed by RNA-directed DNA methylation. This process is guided by 24-nt short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) whose double-stranded precursors are synthesized by DNA-dependent NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol IV) and RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2). Pol IV and RDR2 coimmunoprecipitate, and their activities are tightly coupled, yet the basis for their association is unknown. Here, we show that an interval near the RDR2 active site contacts the Pol IV catalytic subunit, NRPD1, the largest of Pol IV's 12 subunits. Contacts between the catalytic regions of the two enzymes suggests that RDR2 is positioned to rapidly engage the free 3' ends of Pol IV transcripts and convert these single-stranded transcripts into double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs).
PXD031323	33754354	Proteomic Profiling of Hepatocellular Adenomas Paves the Way to Diagnostic and Prognostic Approaches. 	Characterization of tumor heterogeneity in beta-catenin mutated hepatocellular adenomas	hepatocellular adenomas, laser microdissection, tumor heterogeneity	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Through an exploratory proteomic approach based on typical hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs), we previously identified a diagnostic biomarker for a distinctive subtype of HCA with high risk of bleeding, already validated on a multicenter cohort. We hypothesized that the whole protein expression deregulation profile could deliver much more informative data for tumor characterization. Therefore, we pursued our analysis with the characterization of HCA proteomic profiles, evaluating their correspondence with the established genotype/phenotype classification and assessing whether they could provide added diagnosis and prognosis values. APPROACH AND RESULTS: From a collection of 260 cases, we selected 52 typical cases of all different subgroups on which we built a reference HCA proteomics database. Combining laser microdissection and mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we compared the relative protein abundances between tumoral (T) and nontumoral (NT) liver tissues from each patient and we defined a specific proteomic profile of each of the HCA subgroups. Next, we built a matching algorithm comparing the proteomic profile extracted from a patient with our reference HCA database. Proteomic profiles allowed HCA classification and made diagnosis possible, even for complex cases with immunohistological or genomic analysis that did not lead to a formal conclusion. Despite a well-established pathomolecular classification, clinical practices have not substantially changed and the HCA management link to the assessment of the malignant transformation risk remains delicate for many surgeons. That is why we also identified and validated a proteomic profile that would directly evaluate malignant transformation risk regardless of HCA subtype. CONCLUSIONS: This work proposes a proteomic-based machine learning tool, operational on fixed biopsies, that can improve diagnosis and prognosis and therefore patient management for HCAs.
PXD022941	33754701	Mesh Fragmentation Improves Dissociation Efficiency in Top-down Proteomics. 	Stradard protein and yeast top-down data	Mesh, instrument control, real-time, stepped HCD, top-down	Top-down proteomics is a key mass spectrometry-based technology for comprehensive analysis of proteoforms. Proteoforms exhibit multiple high charge states and isotopic forms in full MS scans. The dissociation behavior of proteoforms in different charge states and subjected to different collision energies is highly variable. The current widely employed data-dependent acquisition (DDA) method selects a narrow m/z range (corresponding to a single proteoform charge state) for dissociation from the most abundant precursors. We describe here Mesh, a novel dissociation strategy, to dissociate multiple charge states of one proteoform with multiple collision energies. We show that the Mesh strategy has the potential to generate fragment ions with improved sequence coverage and improve identification ratios in top-down proteomic analyses of complex samples. The strategy is implemented within an open-source instrument control software program named MetaDrive to perform real time deconvolution and precursor selection.
PXD015188	33755436	Chemical Phosphoproteomics Sheds New Light on the Targets and Modes of Action of AKT Inhibitors. 	Chemical and phosphoproteomics illuminate the cellular mode of action of AKT inhibitors	AKT inhibitor, phosphorylation	Due to its important roles in oncogenic signaling, AKT has been subjected to extensive drug discovery efforts leading to small molecule inhibitors investigated in advanced clinical trials. To better understand how these drugs exert their therapeutic effects at the molecular level, we combined chemoproteomic target affinity profiling using kinobeads and phosphoproteomics to analyze the five clinical AKT inhibitors AZD5363 (Capivasertib), GSK2110183 (Afuresertib), GSK690693, Ipatasertib, and MK-2206 in BT-474 breast cancer cells. Kinobead profiling identified between four and 29 nM targets for these compounds and showed that AKT1 and AKT2 were the only common targets. Similarly, measuring the response of the phosphoproteome to the same inhibitors identified ~1700 regulated phosphorylation sites, 276 of which were perturbed by all five compounds. This analysis expanded the known AKT signaling network by 119 phosphoproteins that may represent direct or indirect targets of AKT. Within this new network, 41 regulated phosphorylation sites harbor the AKT substrate motif, and recombinant kinase assays validated 16 as novel AKT substrates. These included CEP170 and FAM83H, suggesting a regulatory function of AKT in mitosis and cytoskeleton organization. In addition, a specific phosphorylation pattern on the ULK1-FIP200-ATG13-VAPB complex was found to determine the active state of ULK1, leading to elevated autophagy in response to AKT inhibition.
PXD021493	33757833	Integrated Redox Proteomic Analysis Highlights New Mechanisms of Sensitivity to Silver Nanoparticles. 	Integrated Redox Proteomic Analysis Highlights New Mechanisms of Sensitivity to Silver Nanoparticles	Lung, Mitochondria, Reversible Protein Oxidation, Silver Nanoparticles	Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used nanomaterials in both commercial and clinical biomedical applications, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their activity remain elusive. In this study we profiled proteomics and redox proteomics changes induced by AgNPs in two lung cancer cell lines: AgNPs-sensitive Calu-1 and AgNPs-resistant NCI-H358. We show that AgNPs induce changes in protein abundance and reversible oxidation in a time and cell-line-dependent manner impacting critical cellular processes such as protein translation and modification, lipid metabolism, bioenergetics, and mitochondrial dynamics. Supporting confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data further emphasize mitochondria as a target of AgNPs toxicity differentially impacting mitochondrial networks and morphology in Calu-1 and NCI-H358 lung cells. Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021493.
PXD024559	33757879	Identification of cellular proteins interacting with PEDV M protein through APEX2 labeling. 	Identification of cellular proteins interacting with PEDV M protein through APEX2 labeling	APEX2, PEDV, cellular proteins, interaction, membrane protein	Membrane (M) proteins of coronaviruses are the most abundant component of the virus envelope and play crucial roles in virus assembly, virus budding and the regulation of host immunity. To understand more about these functions in the context of PEDV M protein, forty host cell proteins interacting with the M protein were identified in the present study by exploiting the proximity-labeling enzyme APEX2 (a mutant soybean ascorbate peroxidase). Bioinformatic analysis showed that the identified host cell proteins were related to fifty-four signal pathways and a wide diversity of biological processes. Interaction between M and five of the identified proteins (RIG-I, PPID, NHE-RF1, S100A11, CLDN4) was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). In addition, knockdown of PPID and S100A11 genes by siRNA significantly improved virus production, indicating that the proteins encoded by the two genes were interfering with or down-regulating virus replication in infected cells. Identification of the host cell proteins accomplished in this study provides new information about the mechanisms underlying PEDV replication and immune evasion. SIGNIFICANCE: PEDV M protein is an essential structural protein implicated in viral infection, replication and assembly although the precise mechanisms underlying these functions remain enigmatic. In this study, we have identified 40 host cell proteins that interact with PEDV M protein using the proximity-labeling enzyme APEX2. Co-immunoprecipitation subsequently confirmed interactions between PEDV M protein and five host cell proteins, two of which (S100A11 and PPID) were involved in down-regulating virus replication in infected cells. This study is significant in that it formulates a strategy to provide new information about the mechanisms relating to the novel functions of PEDV M protein.
PXD023661	33757880	Proteomic evidence for the silk fibroin genes of spider mites (Order Trombidiformes: Family Tetranychidae). 	Proteomic evidence for the silk fibroin genes of spider mites (order Trombidiformes: family Tetranychidae)	acari, fibroin, silk, spider mites	Spider mites are a group of arachnids belonging to Acari (mites and ticks), family Tetranychidae, known to produce nanoscale silk fibers characterized by a high Young's modulus. The silk fibroin gene of spider mites has been computationally predicted through genomic analysis of Tetranychus urticae Koch, but it has yet to be confirmed by proteomic evidence. In this work, we sequenced and assembled the transcriptome from two genera of spider mites, Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida and Panonychus citri (McGregor), and combined it with silk proteomics of T. urticae and P. citri to characterize the fibroin genes through comparative genomics and multiomics analysis. As a result, two fibroins were identified, which were different genes than those previously predicted by computational methods. The amino acid composition and secondary structure suggest similarity to aciniform or cylindrical spidroins of spider silk, which partly mirrors their mechanical properties, exhibiting a high Young's modulus. The availability of full-length fibroin sequences of spider mites facilitates the study of the evolution of silk genes that sometimes emerge in multiple lineages in a convergent manner and in the industrial application of artificial protein fibers through the study of the amino acid sequence and the resulting mechanical properties of these silks. SIGNIFICANCE: Here we sequenced and assembled the transcriptome from two genera of spider mites, T. kanzawai and P. citri, and combined it with silk proteomics of T. urticae and P. citri to characterize the fibroin genes through comparative genomics and multiomics analysis. Spider mite silk is especially characterized by its extremely fine nano-scale diameter and high Young's modulus, even exceeding those of spider silks. The availability of full-length fibroin sequences of spider mites facilitates the study of the evolution of silk genes, which independently evolved in mites, insects, and spiders but yet show sequence convergence, and in the industrial application of artificial protein fibers through the study of the amino acid sequence and the resulting mechanical properties of these silks.
PXD022639	33757881	Targeted mass spectrometry quantification of total soy protein residues from commercially processed ingredients for food allergen management. 	Targeted mass spectrometry quantification of total soy protein residues from commercially processed ingredients for food allergen management	Soybean, food allergen, quantification	Soybean is one of the most commonly allergenic foods in the U.S. However, the variety of commercial soy ingredients used in the food industry makes soybean a challenging allergen to detect and quantify. The processing methods used to produce soy-derived ingredients result in protein modifications that often substantially impact detection and quantification with commonly used antibody-based methods. This study aimed to develop a mass spectrometry (MS)-based method capable of quantifying commercially processed soy ingredients in food matrices. A quantification strategy using external standards with internal calibrants was developed and evaluated, resulting in the ultimate use of a matrix-independent standard curve of non-roasted soy flour with milk proteins as carrier proteins. The method performance was evaluated by quantifying six soy-derived ingredients in incurred food matrices using three quantification strategies. Out of the twelve ingredient-matrix combinations with 10 ppm incurred total soy protein, eight had maximum recoveries between 60 and 120% using the full standard curve strategy. Other quantification strategies may be useful for internal quality control and interlaboratory calibrations. Compared with three commercial ELISA kits, the MS method showed a substantial advantage in quantifying the highly processed soy proteins in food matrices. SIGNIFICANCE: The ability to quantify undeclared soy protein in food products regardless of the soy ingredient source is essential for food allergen management, risk assessment, and regulatory enforcement. The MS-based method described here is able to reliably quantify six different soy-derived ingredients incurred in a model processed food. When compared with existing commercial ELISA methods, the MS method is much less affected by matrices and ingredient types, indicating its wider applicability to a range of soy-derived ingredients and processed products.
PXD024153	33758061	Essential requirement for JPT2 in NAADP-evoked Ca(2+) signaling. 	U. Minnesota / Medical College of Wisconsin - Gihan Gunaratne		Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a second messenger that releases Ca(2+) from acidic organelles through the activation of two-pore channels (TPCs) to regulate endolysosomal trafficking events. NAADP action is mediated by NAADP-binding protein(s) of unknown identity that confer NAADP sensitivity to TPCs. Here, we used a "clickable" NAADP-based photoprobe to isolate human NAADP-binding proteins and identified Jupiter microtubule-associated homolog 2 (JPT2) as a TPC accessory protein required for endogenous NAADP-evoked Ca(2+) signaling. JPT2 was also required for the translocation of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pseudovirus through the endolysosomal system. Thus, JPT2 is a component of the NAADP receptor complex that is essential for TPC-dependent Ca(2+) signaling and control of coronaviral entry.
PXD024655	33758086	Whole-Genome Transformation Promotes tRNA Anticodon Suppressor Mutations under Stress. 	Whole-genome transformation for industrial yeast strain development	anticodon, tRNA, thermotolerance, whole-genome transformation	tRNAs are encoded by a large gene family, usually with several isogenic tRNAs interacting with the same codon. Mutations in the anticodon region of other tRNAs can overcome specific tRNA deficiencies. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that such mutations have occurred in evolution, but the driving force is unclear. We show that in yeast suppressor mutations in other tRNAs are able to overcome deficiency of the essential TRT2-encoded tRNA(Thr)CGU at high temperature (40degreesC). Surprisingly, these tRNA suppressor mutations were obtained after whole-genome transformation with DNA from thermotolerant Kluyveromyces marxianus or Ogataea polymorpha strains but from which the mutations did apparently not originate. We suggest that transient presence of donor DNA in the host facilitates proliferation at high temperature and thus increases the chances for occurrence of spontaneous mutations suppressing defective growth at high temperature. Whole-genome sequence analysis of three transformants revealed only four to five nonsynonymous mutations of which one causing TRT2 anticodon stem stabilization and two anticodon mutations in non-threonyl-tRNAs, tRNA(Lys)CUU and tRNA(eMet)CAU, were causative. Both anticodon mutations suppressed lethality of TRT2 deletion and apparently caused the respective tRNAs to become novel substrates for threonyl-tRNA synthetase. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data could not detect any significant mistranslation, and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR results contradicted induction of the unfolded protein response. We suggest that stress conditions have been a driving force in evolution for the selection of anticodon-switching mutations in tRNAs as revealed by phylogenetic analysis.IMPORTANCE In this work, we have identified for the first time the causative elements in a eukaryotic organism introduced by applying whole-genome transformation and responsible for the selectable trait of interest, i.e., high temperature tolerance. Surprisingly, the whole-genome transformants contained just a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were unrelated to the sequence of the donor DNA. In each of three independent transformants, we have identified a SNP in a tRNA, either stabilizing the essential tRNA(Thr)CGU at high temperature or switching the anticodon of tRNA(Lys)CUU or tRNA(eMet)CAU into CGU, which is apparently enough for in vivo recognition by threonyl-tRNA synthetase. LC-MS/MS analysis indeed indicated absence of significant mistranslation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that similar mutations have occurred throughout evolution and we suggest that stress conditions may have been a driving force for their selection. The low number of SNPs introduced by whole-genome transformation may favor its application for improvement of industrial yeast strains.
PXD022098	33758186	Translation error clusters induced by aminoglycoside antibiotics. 	Translation Error Clusters Induced by Aminoglycoside Antibiotics	aminoglycosides	Aminoglycoside antibiotics target the ribosome and induce mistranslation, yet which translation errors induce bacterial cell death is unclear. The analysis of cellular proteins by quantitative mass spectrometry shows that bactericidal aminoglycosides induce not only single translation errors, but also clusters of errors in full-length proteins in vivo with as many as four amino acid substitutions in a row. The downstream errors in a cluster are up to 10,000-fold more frequent than the first error and independent of the intracellular aminoglycoside concentration. The prevalence, length, and composition of error clusters depends not only on the misreading propensity of a given aminoglycoside, but also on its ability to inhibit ribosome translocation along the mRNA. Error clusters constitute a distinct class of misreading events in vivo that may provide the predominant source of proteotoxic stress at low aminoglycoside concentration, which is particularly important for the autocatalytic uptake of the drugs.
PXD022739	33758202	The M-phase regulatory phosphatase PP2A-B55delta opposes protein kinase A on Arpp19 to initiate meiotic division. 	The M-phase regulatory phosphatase PP2A-B55delta opposes protein kinase A on Arpp19 to initiate meiotic division	Arpp19, B55, M-phase, Oocyte, PP2A, Xenopus, meiotic, phosphatase, phosphorylation	Oocytes are held in meiotic prophase for prolonged periods until hormonal signals trigger meiotic divisions. Key players of M-phase entry are the opposing Cdk1 kinase and PP2A-B55delta phosphatase. In Xenopus, the protein Arpp19, phosphorylated at serine 67 by Greatwall, plays an essential role in inhibiting PP2A-B55delta, promoting Cdk1 activation. Furthermore, Arpp19 has an earlier role in maintaining the prophase arrest through a second serine (S109) phosphorylated by PKA. Prophase release, induced by progesterone, relies on Arpp19 dephosphorylation at S109, owing to an unknown phosphatase. Here, we identified this phosphatase as PP2A-B55delta. In prophase, PKA and PP2A-B55delta are simultaneously active, suggesting the presence of other important targets for both enzymes. The drop in PKA activity induced by progesterone enables PP2A-B55delta to dephosphorylate S109, unlocking the prophase block. Hence, PP2A-B55delta acts critically on Arpp19 on two distinct sites, opposing PKA and Greatwall to orchestrate the prophase release and M-phase entry.
PXD023610	33758928	microRNA-mediated translation repression through GYF-1 and IFE-4 in C. elegans development. 	microRNA-mediated translation repression through GYF-1 and IFE-4 in C. elegans development	4EHP, C. elegans, microRNA, translation repression	microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing is enacted through the recruitment of effector proteins that direct translational repression or degradation of mRNA targets, but the relative importance of their activities for animal development remains unknown. Our concerted proteomic surveys identified the uncharacterized GYF-domain encoding protein GYF-1 and its direct interaction with IFE-4, the ortholog of the mammalian translation repressor 4EHP, as key miRNA effector proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans. Recruitment of GYF-1 protein to mRNA reporters in vitro or in vivo leads to potent translation repression without affecting the poly(A) tail or impinging on mRNA stability. Loss of gyf-1 is synthetic lethal with hypomorphic alleles of embryonic miR-35-42 and larval (L4) let-7 miRNAs, which is phenocopied through engineered mutations in gyf-1 that abolish interaction with IFE-4. GYF-1/4EHP function is cascade-specific, as loss of gyf-1 had no noticeable impact on the functions of other miRNAs, including lin-4 and lsy-6. Overall, our findings reveal the first direct effector of miRNA-mediated translational repression in C. elegans and its physiological importance for the function of several, but likely not all miRNAs.
PXD022428	33760340	Subzero, saline incubations of Colwellia psychrerythraea reveal strategies and biomarkers for sustained life in extreme icy environments. 	Supercooled, subzero, high salinity incubations of Cp34H reveal long-term mitigation strategies and detectable (peptide) biomarkers for life on other icy worlds	Arctic, Cp34H, biomarkers, culturability, life detection, psychrophile, sea-ice, subzero	Colwellia psychrerythraea is a marine psychrophilic bacterium known for its remarkable ability to maintain activity during long-term exposure to extreme subzero temperatures and correspondingly high salinities in sea ice. These microorganisms must have adaptations to both high salinity and low temperature to survive, be metabolically active, or grow in the ice. Here, we report on an experimental design that allowed us to monitor culturability, cell abundance, activity and proteomic signatures of C. psychrerythraea strain 34H (Cp34H) in subzero brines and supercooled sea water through long-term incubations under eight conditions with varying subzero temperatures, salinities and nutrient additions. Shotgun proteomics found novel metabolic strategies used to maintain culturability in response to each independent experimental variable, particularly in pathways regulating carbon, nitrogen and fatty acid metabolism. Statistical analysis of abundances of proteins uniquely identified in isolated conditions provide metabolism-specific protein biosignatures indicative of growth or survival in either increased salinity, decreased temperature, or nutrient limitation. Additionally, to aid in the search for extant life on other icy worlds, analysis of detected short peptides in -10degreesC incubations after 4 months identified over 500 potential biosignatures that could indicate the presence of terrestrial-like cold-active or halophilic metabolisms on other icy worlds.
PXD023921	33760615	Multi-protease Approach for the Improved Identification and Molecular Characterization of Small Proteins and Short Open Reading Frame-Encoded Peptides. 	Multi-protease approach for the improved identification and molecular characterization of small proteins and short open reading frame-encoded peptides	Peptidomics, SEP, sORF	The identification of proteins below approximately 70-100 amino acids in bottom-up proteomics is still a challenging task due to the limited number of peptides generated by proteolytic digestion. This includes the short open reading frame-encoded peptides (SEPs), which are a subset of the small proteins that were not previously annotated or that are alternatively encoded. Here, we systematically investigated the use of multiple proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, LysC, LysargiNase, and GluC) in GeLC-MS/MS analysis to improve the sequence coverage and the number of identified peptides for small proteins, with a focus on SEPs, in the archaeon Methanosarcina mazei. Combining the data of all proteases, we identified 63 small proteins and additional 28 SEPs with at least two unique peptides, while only 55 small proteins and 22 SEP could be identified using trypsin only. For 27 small proteins and 12 SEPs, a complete sequence coverage was achieved. Moreover, for five SEPs, incorrectly predicted translation start points or potential in vivo proteolytic processing were identified, confirming the data of a previous top-down proteomics study of this organism. The results show clearly that a multi-protease approach allows to improve the identification and molecular characterization of small proteins and SEPs. LC-MS data: ProteomeXchange PXD023921.
PXD018713	33760729	Tachykinin signaling inhibits task-specific behavioral responsiveness in honeybee workers. 	Honeybee brain neuropeptides LC-MSMS	brain, honeybee, neruopeptide	Behavioral specialization is key to the success of social insects and leads to division of labor among colony members. Response thresholds to task-specific stimuli are thought to proximally regulate behavioral specialization, but their neurobiological regulation is complex and not well understood. Here, we show that response thresholds to task-relevant stimuli correspond to the specialization of three behavioral phenotypes of honeybee workers in the well-studied and important Apis mellifera and Apis cerana. Quantitative neuropeptidome comparisons suggest two tachykinin-related peptides (TRP2 and TRP3) as candidates for the modification of these response thresholds. Based on our characterization of their receptor binding and downstream signaling, we confirm a functional role of tachykinin signaling in regulating specific responsiveness of honeybee workers: TRP2 injection and RNAi-mediated downregulation cause consistent, opposite effects on responsiveness to task-specific stimuli of each behaviorally specialized phenotype but not to stimuli that are unrelated to their tasks. Thus, our study demonstrates that TRP signaling regulates the degree of task-specific responsiveness of specialized honeybee workers and may control the context specificity of behavior in animals more generally.
PXD023821	33761352	EPB41L5 controls podocyte extracellular matrix assembly by adhesome-dependent force transmission. 	Analysis of podocyte adhesome proteomes	ECM, adhesome	The integrity of the kidney filtration barrier essentially relies on the balanced interplay of podocytes and the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Here, we show by analysis of in vitro and in vivo models that a loss of the podocyte-specific FERM-domain protein EPB41L5 results in impaired extracellular matrix (ECM) assembly. By using quantitative proteomics analysis of the secretome and matrisome, we demonstrate a shift in ECM composition characterized by diminished deposition of core GBM components, such as LAMA5. Integrin adhesome proteomics reveals that EPB41L5 recruits PDLIM5 and ACTN4 to integrin adhesion complexes (IACs). Consecutively, EPB41L5 knockout podocytes show insufficient maturation of integrin adhesion sites, which translates into impaired force transmission and ECM assembly. These observations build the framework for a model in which EPB41L5 functions as a cell-type-specific regulator of the podocyte adhesome and controls a localized adaptive module in order to prevent podocyte detachment and thereby ensures GBM integrity.
PXD016786	33762013	Opportunistic bacteria with reduced genomes are effective competitors for organic nitrogen compounds in coastal dinoflagellate blooms. 	Proteomic responses of Lentibacter algarum HYO3 to DOC amendments	Bacteria, Lentibacter	BACKGROUND: Phytoplankton blooms are frequent events in coastal areas and increase the production of organic matter that initially shapes the growth of opportunistic heterotrophic bacteria. However, it is unclear how these opportunists are involved in the transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) when blooms occur and the subsequent impacts on biogeochemical cycles. RESULTS: We used a combination of genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approaches to study bacterial diversity, genome traits, and metabolic responses to assess the source and lability of DOM in a spring coastal bloom of Akashiwo sanguinea. We identified molecules that significantly increased during bloom development, predominantly belonging to amino acids, dipeptides, lipids, nucleotides, and nucleosides. The opportunistic members of the bacterial genera Polaribacter, Lentibacter, and Litoricola represented a significant proportion of the free-living and particle-associated bacterial assemblages during the stationary phase of the bloom. Polaribacter marinivivus, Lentibacter algarum, and Litoricola marina were isolated and their genomes exhibited streamlining characterized by small genome size and low GC content and non-coding densities, as well as a smaller number of transporters and peptidases compared to closely related species. However, the core proteomes identified house-keeping functions, such as various substrate transporters, peptidases, motility, chemotaxis, and antioxidants, in response to bloom-derived DOM. We observed a unique metabolic signature for the three species in the utilization of multiple dissolved organic nitrogen compounds. The metabolomic data showed that amino acids and dipeptides (such as isoleucine and proline) were preferentially taken up by P. marinivivus and L. algarum, whereas nucleotides and nucleosides (such as adenosine and purine) were preferentially selected by L. marina. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the enriched DOM in stationary phase of phytoplankton bloom is a result of ammonium depletion. This environment drives genomic streamlining of opportunistic bacteria to exploit their preferred nitrogen-containing compounds and maintain nutrient cycling. Video abstract.
PXD024266	33762435	Faciogenital Dysplasia 5 supports cancer stem cell traits in basal-like breast cancer by enhancing EGFR stability. 	Proteins that interact with FGD5 in MDA-MB-231		Most basal-like breast cancers (BLBCs) are triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which have the worst prognosis and distant metastasis-free survival among breast cancer subtypes. Now, no targeted therapies are available for patients with BLBC due to the lack of reliable and effective molecular targets. Here, we performed the BLBC tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical analysis and showed that Faciogenital Dysplasia 5 (FGD5) abundance is associated with poor prognosis in BLBCs. FGD5 deletion decreased the proliferation, invasion, and tumorsphere formation capacity of BLBC cells. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Fgd5 in mouse mammary epithelial cells attenuated BLBC initiation and progression by reducing the self-renewal ability of tumor-initiating cells. In addition, FGD5 abundance was positively correlated with the abundance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in BLBCs. FGD5 ablation decreased EGFR abundance by reducing EGFR stability in TNBC cells in 2D and 3D culture conditions. Mechanistically, FGD5 binds to EGFR and interferes with basal EGFR ubiquitination and degradation induced by the E3 ligase ITCH. Impaired EGFR degradation caused BLBC cell proliferation and promoted invasive properties and self-renewal. To verify the role of the FGD5-EGFR interaction in the regulation of EGFR stability, we screened a cell-penetrating alpha-helical peptide PER3 binding with FGD5 to disrupt the interaction. Treatment of BLBC patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice with the peptide PER3 disrupting the FGD5-EGFR interaction either with or without chemotherapy reduced BLBC progression. Our study identified FGD5 as a positive modulator of tumor-initiating cells and suggests a potential therapeutic option for the BLBC subtype of breast cancer.
PXD022356	33762641	Protein cleavage influences surface protein presentation in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. 	Mycoplasma pneumoniae processes functionally diverse proteins (N-Terminiome & Surfaceome)	Affinity, Mycoplasma, N-Terminiome, Surfaceome, pneumonia	Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a significant cause of pneumonia and post infection sequelae affecting organ sites distant to the respiratory tract are common. It is also a model organism where extensive 'omics' studies have been conducted to gain insight into how minimal genome self-replicating organisms function. An N-terminome study undertaken here identified 4898 unique N-terminal peptides that mapped to 391 (56%) predicted M. pneumoniae proteins. True N-terminal sequences beginning with the initiating methionine (iMet) residue from the predicted Open Reading Frame (ORF) were identified for 163 proteins. Notably, almost half (317; 46%) of the ORFS derived from M. pneumoniae strain M129 are post-translationally modified, presumably by proteolytic processing, because dimethyl labelled neo-N-termini were characterised that mapped beyond the predicted N-terminus. An analysis of the N-terminome describes endoproteolytic processing events predominately targeting tryptic-like sites, though cleavages at negatively charged residues in P1' (D and E) with lysine or serine/alanine in P2' and P3' positions also occurred frequently. Surfaceome studies identified 160 proteins (23% of the proteome) to be exposed on the extracellular surface of M. pneumoniae. The two orthogonal methodologies used to characterise the surfaceome each identified the same 116 proteins, a 72% (116/160) overlap. Apart from lipoproteins, transporters, and adhesins, 93/160 (58%) of the surface proteins lack signal peptides and have well characterised, canonical functions in the cell. Of the 160 surface proteins identified, 134 were also targets of endo-proteolytic processing. These processing events are likely to have profound implications for how the host immune system recognises and responds to M. pneumoniae.
PXD017236	33762733	NASH limits anti-tumour surveillance in immunotherapy-treated HCC. 	PD-1-targeted immunotherapy in NASH-triggered liver cancer induces pro-tumorigenic environment through CD8+PD-1+ T-cells	CD8+PD1+, NASH, immunotherapy	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can have viral or non-viral causes(1-5). Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need(6,7). Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8(+)PD1(+) T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8(+)PD1(+) T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8(+)PD1(+)CXCR6(+), TOX(+), and TNF(+) T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8(+) T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8(+) T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8(+)PD1(+) T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment.
PXD022442	33763056	Proteinase-Mediated Macrophage Signaling in Psoriatic Arthritis. 	Proteinases in psoriatic arthritis	Q Exactive Plus, homo sapiens, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis	Objective: Multiple proteinases are present in the synovial fluid (SF) of an arthritic joint. We aimed to identify inflammatory cell populations present in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) SF compared to osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), identify their proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) signaling function and characterize potentially active SF serine proteinases that may be PAR2 activators. Methods: Flow cytometry was used to characterize SF cells from PsA, RA, OA patients; PsA SF cells were further characterized by single cell 3'-RNA-sequencing. Active serine proteinases were identified through cleavage of fluorogenic trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like substrates, activity-based probe analysis and proteomics. Fluo-4 AM was used to monitor intracellular calcium cell signaling. Cytokine expression was evaluated using a multiplex Luminex panel. Results: PsA SF cells were dominated by monocytes/macrophages, which consisted of three populations representing classical, non-classical and intermediate cells. The classical monocytes/macrophages were reduced in PsA compared to OA/RA, whilst the intermediate population was increased. PAR2 was elevated in OA vs. PsA/RA SF monocytes/macrophages, particularly in the intermediate population. PAR2 expression and signaling in primary PsA monocytes/macrophages significantly impacted the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Trypsin-like serine proteinase activity was elevated in PsA and RA SF compared to OA, while chymotrypsin-like activity was elevated in RA compared to PsA. Tryptase-6 was identified as an active serine proteinase in SF that could trigger calcium signaling partially via PAR2. Conclusion: PAR2 and its activating proteinases, including tryptase-6, can be important mediators of inflammation in PsA. Components within this proteinase-receptor axis may represent novel therapeutic targets.
PXD022607	33763075	PI3Kdelta Forms Distinct Multiprotein Complexes at the TCR Signalosome in Naive and Differentiated CD4(+) T Cells. 	The PI3Kdelta interactome in naÃ¯ve and activated mouse CD4+ T cells	10-plex, AP-MS, CD4+, PI3K, PI3Kdelta, T-cells, TCR, TMT, interactome, nLC-MS/MS	Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) play a central role in adaptive immunity by transducing signals from the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) via production of PIP3. PI3Kdelta is a heterodimer composed of a p110delta catalytic subunit associated with a p85alpha or p85beta regulatory subunit and is preferentially engaged by the TCR upon T cell activation. The molecular mechanisms leading to PI3Kdelta recruitment and activation at the TCR signalosome remain unclear. In this study, we have used quantitative mass spectrometry, biochemical approaches and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to uncover the p110delta interactome in primary CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, we have determined how the PI3Kdelta interactome changes upon the differentiation of small naive T cells into T cell blasts expanded in the presence of IL-2. Our interactomic analyses identified multiple constitutive and inducible PI3Kdelta-interacting proteins, some of which were common to naive and previously-activated T cells. Our data reveals that PI3Kdelta rapidly interacts with as many as seven adaptor proteins upon TCR engagement, including the Gab-family proteins, GAB2 and GAB3, a CD5-CBL signalosome and the transmembrane proteins ICOS and TRIM. Our results also suggest that PI3Kdelta pre-forms complexes with the adaptors SH3KBP1 and CRKL in resting cells that could facilitate the localization and activation of p110delta at the plasma membrane by forming ternary complexes during early TCR signalling. Furthermore, we identify interactions that were not previously known to occur in CD4(+) T cells, involving BCAP, GAB3, IQGAP3 and JAML. We used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockout in primary T cells to confirm that BCAP is a positive regulator of PI3K-AKT signalling in CD4(+) T cell blasts. Overall, our results provide evidence for a large protein network that regulates the recruitment and activation of PI3Kdelta in T cells. Finally, this work shows how the PI3Kdelta interactome is remodeled as CD4(+) T cells differentiate from naive T cells to activated T cell blasts. These activated T cells upregulate additional PI3Kdelta adaptor proteins, including BCAP, GAB2, IQGAP3 and ICOS. This rewiring of TCR-PI3K signalling that occurs upon T cell differentiation may serve to reduce the threshold of activation and diversify the inputs for the PI3K pathway in effector T cells.
PXD023205	33763411	Re-routing of Sugar Catabolism Provides a Better Insight Into Fungal Flexibility in Using Plant Biomass-Derived Monomers as Substrates. 	Experimental validation of a central carbon metabolic model in Aspergillus niger to enable metabolic engineering of a fungal cell factory	CAZymes, D-galacturonic acid catabolic pathway, L-rhamnose catabolic pathway, lignocellulosic substrates, pentose catabolic pathway, sugar beet pulp, wheat bran	The filamentous ascomycete Aspergillus niger has received increasing interest as a cell factory, being able to efficiently degrade plant cell wall polysaccharides as well as having an extensive metabolism to convert the released monosaccharides into value added compounds. The pentoses D-xylose and L-arabinose are the most abundant monosaccharides in plant biomass after the hexose D-glucose, being major constituents of xylan, pectin and xyloglucan. In this study, the influence of selected pentose catabolic pathway (PCP) deletion strains on growth on plant biomass and re-routing of sugar catabolism was addressed to gain a better understanding of the flexibility of this fungus in using plant biomass-derived monomers. The transcriptome, metabolome and proteome response of three PCP mutant strains, DeltalarADeltaxyrADeltaxyrB, DeltaladADeltaxdhADeltasdhA and DeltaxkiA, grown on wheat bran (WB) and sugar beet pulp (SBP), was evaluated. Our results showed that despite the absolute impact of these PCP mutations on pure pentose sugars, they are not as critical for growth of A. niger on more complex biomass substrates, such as WB and SBP. However, significant phenotypic variation was observed between the two biomass substrates, but also between the different PCP mutants. This shows that the high sugar heterogeneity of these substrates in combination with the high complexity and adaptability of the fungal sugar metabolism allow for activation of alternative strategies to support growth.
PXD022127	33763969	Proteomics reveals the potential mechanism of Mrps35 controlling Listeria monocytogenes intracellular proliferation in macrophages. 	Proteomics reveals the potential mechanism of Mrps35 controlling Listeria intracellular proliferation in macrophages	Mrps35  Rpl22l  Listeria infection  macrophages  Proteomics	Macrophages are sentinels in the organism which can resist and destroy various bacteria through direct phagocytosis. Here, we reported that expression level of mitochondrial ribosomal protein S35 (Mrps35) continued to decrease over infection time after Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) infected macrophages. Our results indicated that knockdown Mrps35 increased the load of L. monocytogenes in macrophages. This result supported that Mrps35 played the crucial roles in L. monocytogenes infection. Moreover, we performed the comprehensive proteomics to analyze the differentially expressed protein of wild type and Mrps35 Knockdown Raw264.7 cells by L. monocytogenes infection over 6 h. Based on the results of mass spectrometry, we presented a wide variety of hypotheses about the mechanism of Mrps35 controlling the L. monocytogenes intracellular proliferation. Among them, experiments confirmed that Mrps35 and 60S ribosomal protein L22-like 1 (Rpl22l1) were a functional correlation or potentially a compensatory mechanism during L. monocytogenes infection. This study provided new insights into understanding that L. monocytogenes infection changed the basic synthesis or metabolism-related proteins of host cells.
PXD022659	33764077	Improved SILAC Quantification with Data-Independent Acquisition to Investigate Bortezomib-Induced Protein Degradation. 	Improving SILAC quantification with data independent acquisition to investigate bortezomib-induced protein degradation	SILAC, SILAC-DIA, data independent acquisition, protein degradation, protein turnover, quantitative proteomics	Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled to data-dependent acquisition (DDA) is a common approach to quantitative proteomics with the desirable benefit of reducing batch effects during sample processing and data acquisition. More recently, using data-independent acquisition (DIA/SWATH) to systematically measure peptides has gained popularity for its comprehensiveness, reproducibility, and accuracy of quantification. The complementary advantages of these two techniques logically suggests combining them. Here we develop a SILAC-DIA-MS workflow using free, open-source software. We empirically determine that using DIA achieves similar peptide detection numbers as DDA and that DIA improves the quantitative accuracy and precision of SILAC by an order of magnitude. Finally, we apply SILAC-DIA-MS to determine protein turnover rates of cells treated with bortezomib, an FDA-approved 26S proteasome inhibitor for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. We observe that SILAC-DIA produces more sensitive protein turnover models. Of the proteins determined to be differentially degraded by both acquisition methods, we find known proteins that are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, such as HNRNPK, EIF3A, and IF4A1/EIF4A-1, and a slower turnover for CATD, a protein implicated in invasive breast cancer. With improved quantification from DIA, we anticipate that this workflow will make SILAC-based experiments like protein turnover more sensitive.
PXD016711	33764612	Systematic investigation of PRMT6 substrate recognition reveals broad specificity with a preference for an RG motif or basic and bulky residues. 	PRMT6 substrate specificity analysis	Arginine methyltransferase, enzyme specificity, synthetic peptides	Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) catalyses the asymmetric dimethylation of arginines on numerous substrate proteins within the human cell. In particular, PRMT6 methylates histone H3 arginine 2 (H3R2) which affects both gene repression and activation. However, the substrate specificity of PRMT6 has not been comprehensively analysed. Here, we systematically characterise the substrate recognition motif of PRMT6, finding that it has broad specificity and recognises the RG motif. Working with a H3 tail peptide as a template, on which we made 204 amino acid substitutions, we use targeted mass spectrometry to measure their effect on PRMT6 in vitro activity. We first show that PRMT6 methylates R2 and R8 in the H3 peptide, although H3R8 is methylated with lower efficiency and is not an in vivo PRMT6 substrate. We then quantify the effect of 194 of these amino acid substitutions on methylation at both H3R2 and H3R8. In both cases, we find that PRMT6 tolerates essentially any amino acid substitution in the H3 peptide, but that positively charged and bulky residues are preferred near the target arginine. We show that PRMT6 also has preference for glycine, but only in the position immediately following the target arginine. This indicates that PRMT6 recognises the RG motif rather than the RGG motif. We further confirm this preference for the RG motif on another PRMT6 substrate, histone H4R3. This broad specificity and recognition of RG rather than RGG are distinctive among the PRMT family and has implications for the development of drugs to selectively target PRMT6.

PXD023434	33767140	The box C/D snoRNP assembly factor Bcd1 interacts with the histone chaperone Rtt106 and controls its transcription dependent activity. 	The box C/D snoRNP assembly factor Bcd1 interacts with the histone chaperone Rtt106 and controls its transcription dependent activity.	3D structure, Bcd1p, H/D exchange - MS and cross-linking-MS, NMR, Rsa1p, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, X-ray, histone chaperone Rtt106p, native MS, snoRNP assembly	Biogenesis of eukaryotic box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins initiates co-transcriptionally and requires the action of the assembly machinery including the Hsp90/R2TP complex, the Rsa1p:Hit1p heterodimer and the Bcd1 protein. We present genetic interactions between the Rsa1p-encoding gene and genes involved in chromatin organization including RTT106 that codes for the H3-H4 histone chaperone Rtt106p controlling H3K56ac deposition. We show that Bcd1p binds Rtt106p and controls its transcription-dependent recruitment by reducing its association with RNA polymerase II, modulating H3K56ac levels at gene body. We reveal the 3D structures of the free and Rtt106p-bound forms of Bcd1p using nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography. The interaction is also studied by a combination of biophysical and proteomic techniques. Bcd1p interacts with a region that is distinct from the interaction interface between the histone chaperone and histone H3. Our results are evidence for a protein interaction interface for Rtt106p that controls its transcription-associated activity.
PXD019591	33767176	Drug ranking using machine learning systematically predicts the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. 	Machine learning from large-scale proteomics accurately ranks anti-cancer drugs based on efficacy	DRUML, cancer, drug efficacy prediction, drug ranking, machine learning, phosphoproteomics	Artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) promise to transform cancer therapies by accurately predicting the most appropriate therapies to treat individual patients. Here, we present an approach, named Drug Ranking Using ML (DRUML), which uses omics data to produce ordered lists of >400 drugs based on their anti-proliferative efficacy in cancer cells. To reduce noise and increase predictive robustness, instead of individual features, DRUML uses internally normalized distance metrics of drug response as features for ML model generation. DRUML is trained using in-house proteomics and phosphoproteomics data derived from 48 cell lines, and it is verified with data comprised of 53 cellular models from 12 independent laboratories. We show that DRUML predicts drug responses in independent verification datasets with low error (mean squared error < 0.1 and mean Spearman's rank 0.7). In addition, we demonstrate that DRUML predictions of cytarabine sensitivity in clinical leukemia samples are prognostic of patient survival (Log rank p < 0.005). Our results indicate that DRUML accurately ranks anti-cancer drugs by their efficacy across a wide range of pathologies.
PXD018694	33767186	Dissection of two routes to naive pluripotency using different kinase inhibitors. 	MASS SPECTROMETRY ROADMAPS TO NAIVE PLURIPOTENCY	Mouse Stem Cells, Phosphoproteomics	Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be maintained in the naive state through inhibition of Mek1/2 and Gsk3 (2i). A relevant effect of 2i is the inhibition of Cdk8/19, which are negative regulators of the Mediator complex, responsible for the activity of enhancers. Inhibition of Cdk8/19 (Cdk8/19i) stimulates enhancers and, similar to 2i, stabilizes ESCs in the naive state. Here, we use mass spectrometry to describe the molecular events (phosphoproteome, proteome, and metabolome) triggered by 2i and Cdk8/19i on ESCs. Our data reveal widespread commonalities between these two treatments, suggesting overlapping processes. We find that post-transcriptional de-repression by both 2i and Cdk8/19i might support the mitochondrial capacity of naive cells. However, proteome reprogramming in each treatment is achieved by different mechanisms. Cdk8/19i acts directly on the transcriptional machinery, activating key identity genes to promote the naive program. In contrast, 2i stabilizes the naive circuitry through, in part, de-phosphorylation of downstream transcriptional effectors.
PXD019104	33767201	An updated map of Trypanosoma cruzi histone post-translational modifications. 	Histone post-translational modifications of Trypanosoma cruzi: a high-confidence comprehensive map	histone, post-translational modifications, trypanosoma cruzi, trypanosomatids	In humans and other eukaryotes, histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs) play an essential role in the epigenetic control of gene expression. In trypanosomatid parasites, conversely, gene regulation occurs mainly at the post-transcriptional level. However, our group has recently shown that hPTMs are abundant and varied in Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas Disease, signaling for possible conserved epigenetic functions. Here, we applied an optimized mass spectrometry-based proteomic workflow to provide a high-confidence comprehensive map of hPTMs, distributed in all canonical, variant and linker histones of T. cruzi. Our work expands the number of known T. cruzi hPTMs by almost 2-fold, representing the largest dataset of hPTMs available to any trypanosomatid to date, and can be used as a basis for functional studies on the dynamic regulation of chromatin by epigenetic mechanisms and the selection of candidates for the development of epigenetic drugs against trypanosomatids.
PXD023613	33767396	Ultra-fast proteomics with Scanning SWATH. 	Minute-scale proteomics with Scanning SWATH and high-flow chromatography	High-throughput, Scanning SWATH, data-independent acquisition, drug screen, high-flow chromatography	Accurate quantification of the proteome remains challenging for large sample series and longitudinal experiments. We report a data-independent acquisition method, Scanning SWATH, that accelerates mass spectrometric (MS) duty cycles, yielding quantitative proteomes in combination with short gradients and high-flow (800 microl min(-1)) chromatography. Exploiting a continuous movement of the precursor isolation window to assign precursor masses to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragment traces, Scanning SWATH increases precursor identifications by ~70% compared to conventional data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods on 0.5-5-min chromatographic gradients. We demonstrate the application of ultra-fast proteomics in drug mode-of-action screening and plasma proteomics. Scanning SWATH proteomes capture the mode of action of fungistatic azoles and statins. Moreover, we confirm 43 and identify 11 new plasma proteome biomarkers of COVID-19 severity, advancing patient classification and biomarker discovery. Thus, our results demonstrate a substantial acceleration and increased depth in fast proteomic experiments that facilitate proteomic drug screens and clinical studies.
PXD023565	33767427	Multi-omics analyses reveal that HIV-1 alters CD4(+) T cell immunometabolism to fuel virus replication. 	Multi-omics analyses reveal that HIV-1 alters CD4 T cell immunometabolism to fuel virus replication	CD4 T cell, FASTKD5, HIV-1, NLRX1, Oxidative phosphorylation, Virus replication	Individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) show metabolic alterations of CD4(+) T cells through unclear mechanisms with undefined consequences. We analyzed the transcriptome of CD4(+) T cells from patients with HIV-1 and revealed that the elevated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway is associated with poor outcomes. Inhibition of OXPHOS by the US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug metformin, which targets mitochondrial respiratory chain complex-I, suppresses HIV-1 replication in human CD4(+) T cells and humanized mice. In patients, HIV-1 peak viremia positively correlates with the expression of NLRX1, a mitochondrial innate immune receptor. Quantitative proteomics and metabolic analyses reveal that NLRX1 enhances OXPHOS and glycolysis during HIV-1-infection of CD4(+) T cells to promote viral replication. At the mechanistic level, HIV infection induces the association of NLRX1 with the mitochondrial protein FASTKD5 to promote expression of mitochondrial respiratory complex components. This study uncovers the OXPHOS pathway in CD4(+) T cells as a target for HIV-1 therapy.
PXD015411	33768644	The chemical compound 'Heatin' stimulates hypocotyl elongation and interferes with the Arabidopsis NIT1-subfamily of nitrilases. 	The novel chemical growth regulator â€˜Heatin' stimulates thermomorphogenesis by inhibiting the Arabidopsis thaliana NIT1-subfamily of nitrilases	heatin, label-free quantification	Temperature passively affects biological processes involved in plant growth. Therefore, it is challenging to study the dedicated temperature signalling pathways that orchestrate thermomorphogenesis, a suite of elongation growth-based adaptations that enhance leaf-cooling capacity. We screened a chemical library for compounds that restored hypocotyl elongation in the pif4-2-deficient mutant background at warm temperature conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana to identify modulators of thermomorphogenesis. The small aromatic compound 'Heatin', containing 1-iminomethyl-2-naphthol as a pharmacophore, was selected as an enhancer of elongation growth. We show that ARABIDOPSIS ALDEHYDE OXIDASES redundantly contribute to Heatin-mediated hypocotyl elongation. Following a chemical proteomics approach, the members of the NITRILASE1-subfamily of auxin biosynthesis enzymes were identified among the molecular targets of Heatin. Our data reveal that nitrilases are involved in promotion of hypocotyl elongation in response to high temperature and Heatin-mediated hypocotyl elongation requires the NITRILASE1-subfamily members, NIT1 and NIT2. Heatin inhibits NIT1-subfamily enzymatic activity in vitro and the application of Heatin accordingly results in the accumulation of NIT1-subfamily substrate indole-3-acetonitrile in vivo. However, levels of the NIT1-subfamily product, bioactive auxin (indole-3-acetic acid), were also significantly increased. It is likely that the stimulation of hypocotyl elongation by Heatin might be independent of its observed interaction with NITRILASE1-subfamily members. However, nitrilases may contribute to the Heatin response by stimulating indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis in an indirect way. Heatin and its functional analogues present novel chemical entities for studying auxin biology.
PXD021904	33768672	Proteomic analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by exogenous expression of oncogenic kinase fusions identified in lung adenocarcinoma. 	Proteomic analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by oncogenic kinase fusions identified in lung adenocarcinoma	ALK, Lung cancer, RET, ROS1, kinase fusion, phosphoproteomics	Kinase fusions are considered oncogenic drivers in numerous types of cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma 5-10% of patients harbor kinase fusions. The most frequently detected kinase fusion involves the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) and Echinoderm Microtubule-associated protein-Like 4 (EML4). In addition, oncogenic kinase fusions involving the tyrosine kinases RET and ROS1 are found in smaller subsets of patients. In this study, we employed quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to define the cellular tyrosine phosphorylation patterns induced by different oncogenic kinase fusions identified in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. We show that exogenous expression of the kinase fusions in HEK 293T cells leads to widespread tyrosine phosphorylation. Direct comparison of different kinase fusions demonstrates that the kinase part and not the fusion partner primarily defines the phosphorylation pattern. The tyrosine phosphorylation patterns differed between ALK, ROS1, and RET fusions, suggesting that oncogenic signaling induced by these kinases involves the modulation of different cellular processes.
PXD020110	33769614	Proteomics characterization of mitochondrial-derived vesicles under oxidative stress. 	Proteomics Characterization of Mitochondrial-Derived Vesicles Under Oxidative Stress	Cardiac mitochondria, Heart, MDV, Mitochondria, Mitochondrial-derived vesicles, Oxidative stress, Rat	Mitochondria share attributes of vesicular transport with their bacterial ancestors given their ability to form mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs). MDVs are involved in mitochondrial quality control and their formation is enhanced with stress and may, therefore, play a potential role in mitochondrial-cellular communication. However, MDV proteomic cargo has remained mostly undefined. In this study, we strategically used an in vitro MDV budding/reconstitution assay on cardiac mitochondria, followed by graded oxidative stress, to identify and characterize the MDV proteome. Our results confirmed previously identified cardiac MDV markers, while also revealing a complete map of the MDV proteome, paving the way to a better understanding of the role of MDVs. The oxidative stress vulnerability of proteins directed the cargo loading of MDVs, which was enhanced by antimycin A (Ant-A). Among OXPHOS complexes, complexes III and V were found to be Ant-A-sensitive. Proteins from metabolic pathways such as the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism, along with Fe-S cluster, antioxidant response proteins, and autophagy were also found to be Ant-A sensitive. Intriguingly, proteins containing hyper-reactive cysteine residues, metabolic redox switches, including professional redox enzymes and those that mediate iron metabolism, were found to be components of MDV cargo with Ant-A sensitivity. Last, we revealed a possible contribution of MDVs to the formation of extracellular vesicles, which may indicate mitochondrial stress. In conclusion, our study provides an MDV proteomics signature that delineates MDV cargo selectivity and hints at the potential for MDVs and their novel protein cargo to serve as vital biomarkers during mitochondrial stress and related pathologies.
PXD021974	33769819	Proteomics of Human Milk: Definition of a Discovery Workflow for Clinical Research Studies. 	Proteomics of Human Milk: Definition of a Discovery Workflow for Clinical Research Studies	Milk, Shotgun	Milk is a complex biological fluid composed mainly of water, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and diverse bioactive factors. Human milk represents a unique tailored source of nutrients that adapts during lactation to the specific needs of the developing infant. Proteins in milk have been studied for decades, and proteomics, peptidomics, and glycoproteomics are the main approaches previously deployed to decipher the proteome of human milk. In the present work, we aimed at implementing a highly automated pipeline for the proteomic analysis of human milk with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS). Commercial human milk samples were used to evaluate and optimize workflows. Centrifugation for defatting milk samples was assessed before and after reduction, alkylation, and enzymatic digestion of proteins, without and with presence of surfactants. Skimmed milk samples were analyzed using isobaric labeling-based quantitative MS on an Orbitrap Tribrid mass spectrometer. Sample fractionation using isoelectric focusing was also evaluated to more deeply profile the human milk proteome. Finally, the most appropriate workflow was transferred to a liquid handling workstation for automated sample preparation. In conclusion, we have defined and describe herein an efficient highly automated proteomic workflow for human milk sample analysis. It is compatible with clinical research, possibly allowing the analysis of sufficiently large cohorts of samples.
PXD021236	33771697	Mapping Isoform Abundance and Interactome of the Endogenous TMPRSS2-ERG Fusion Protein by Orthogonal Immunoprecipitation-Mass Spectrometry Assays. 	Mapping Isoform Abundance and Interactome of the Endogenous TMPRSS2-ERG Fusion Protein by Orthogonal Immunoprecipitation-Mass Spectrometry Assays	ERG interactome, ERG protein isoforms, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, VCaP cells, cBAF complex, canonical SWI/SNF complex, selected reaction monitoring	TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion, a molecular alteration found in nearly half of primary prostate cancer cases, has been intensively characterized at the transcript level. However limited studies have explored the molecular identity and function of the endogenous fusion at the protein level. Here, we developed immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry assays for the measurement of a low-abundance T1E4 TMPRSS2-ERG fusion protein, its isoforms, and its interactome in VCaP prostate cancer cells. Our assays quantified total ERG (~27,000 copies/cell) and its four unique isoforms and revealed that the T1E4-ERG isoform accounted for 52 +/- 3% of the total ERG protein in VCaP cells, and 50 +/- 11% in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostate cancer tissues. For the first time, the N-terminal peptide (methionine-truncated and N-acetylated TASSSSDYGQTSK) unique for the T1/E4 fusion was identified. ERG interactome profiling with the C-terminal, but not the N-terminal, antibodies identified 29 proteins, including mutually exclusive BRG1- and BRM-associated canonical SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes. Our sensitive and selective IP-SRM assays present alternative tools to quantify ERG and its isoforms in clinical samples, thus paving the way for development of more accurate diagnostics of prostate cancer.
PXD021454	33771868	Multimerization variants as potential drivers of neofunctionalization. 	Arabidopsis leave soluble proteins (CFMS)	CFMS, leave, soluble proteins	Whole-genome duplications are common during evolution, creating genetic redundancy that can enable cellular innovations. Novel protein-protein interactions provide a route to diversified gene functions, but, at present, there is limited proteome-scale knowledge on the extent to which variability in protein complex formation drives neofunctionalization. Here, we used protein correlation profiling to test for variability in apparent mass among thousands of orthologous proteins isolated from diverse species and cell types. Variants in protein complex size were unexpectedly common, in some cases appearing after relatively recent whole-genome duplications or an allopolyploidy event. In other instances, variants such as those in the carbonic anhydrase orthologous group reflected the neofunctionalization of ancient paralogs that have been preserved in extant species. Our results demonstrate that homo- and heteromer formation have the potential to drive neofunctionalization in diverse classes of enzymes, signaling, and structural proteins.
PXD022688	33777071	SP3 Protocol for Proteomic Plant Sample Preparation Prior LC-MS/MS. 	SP3 protocol for proteomic plant sample preparation prior LC-MS/MS	FASP, SDS removal, SP3, bottom-up, carboxylated magnetic beads, protein cleanup	Quantitative protein extraction from biological samples, as well as contaminants removal before LC-MS/MS, is fundamental for the successful bottom-up proteomic analysis. Four sample preparation methods, including the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), two single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparations (SP3) on carboxylated or HILIC paramagnetic beads, and protein suspension trapping method (S-Trap) were evaluated for SDS removal and protein digestion from Arabidopsis thaliana (AT) lysate. Finally, the optimized carboxylated SP3 workflow was benchmarked closely against the routine FASP. Ultimately, LC-MS/MS analyses revealed that regarding the number of identifications, number of missed cleavages, proteome coverage, repeatability, reduction of handling time, and cost per assay, the SP3 on carboxylated magnetic particles proved to be the best alternative for SDS and other contaminants removal from plant sample lysate. A robust and efficient 2-h SP3 protocol for a wide range of protein input is presented, benefiting from no need to adjust the amount of beads, binding and rinsing conditions, or digestion parameters.
PXD023363	33777096	Functional Network of the Long Non-coding RNA Growth Arrest-Specific Transcript 5 and Its Interacting Proteins in Senescence. 	Mouse hippocampus RNA pull down LC-MS/MS	Mouse hippocampus, RNA pull down	Increasing studies show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in various fundamental biological processes. Long non-coding RNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) showed differential expressions between young and old mouse brains in our previous RNA-Seq data, suggesting its potential role in senescence and brain aging. Examination using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that GAS5 had a significantly higher expression level in the old mouse brain hippocampus region than the young one. Cellular fractionation using hippocampus-derived HT22 cell line confirmed its nucleoplasm and cytoplasm subcellular localization. Overexpression or knockdown of GAS5 in HT22 cell line revealed that GAS5 inhibits cell cycle progression and promotes cell apoptosis. RNA-Seq analysis of GAS5-knockdown HT22 cells identified differentially expressed genes related to cell proliferation (e.g., DNA replication and nucleosome assembly biological processes). RNA pull-down assay using mouse brain hippocampus tissues showed that potential GAS5 interacting proteins could be enriched into several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and some of them are involved in senescence-associated diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. These results contribute to understand better the underlying functional network of GAS5 and its interacting proteins in senescence at brain tissue and brain-derived cell line levels. Our study may also provide a reference for developing diagnostic and clinic biomarkers of GAS5 in senescence and brain aging.
PXD024209	33777753	Identification of Proteins Deregulated by Platinum-Based Chemotherapy as Novel Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. 	Identification of proteins deregulated by platinum-based chemotherapy as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in non-small cell lung cancer	Cisplatin, H460, NSCLC	Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for most people with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), either as adjuvant therapy in combination with a second cytotoxic agent or in combination with immunotherapy. Resistance to therapy, either in the form of primary refractory disease or evolutionary resistance, remains a significant issue in the treatment of NSCLC. Hence, predictive biomarkers and novel combinational strategies are required to improve the effectiveness and durability of treatment response 6for people with NSCLC. The aim of this study was to identify novel biomarkers and/or druggable proteins from deregulated protein networks within non-oncogene driven disease that are involved in the cellular response to cisplatin. Following exposure of NSCLC cells to cisplatin, in vitro quantitative mass spectrometry was applied to identify altered protein response networks. A total of 65 proteins were significantly deregulated following cisplatin exposure. These proteins were assessed to determine if they are druggable targets using novel machine learning approaches and to identify whether these proteins might serve as prognosticators of platinum therapy. Our data demonstrate novel candidates and drug-like molecules warranting further investigation to improve response to platinum agents in NSCLC.
PXD023847	33777793	Serum Metabolic Profiling Analysis of Chronic Gastritis and Gastric Cancer by Untargeted Metabolomics. 	Serum metabolic profiling analysis of chronic gastritis and gastric cancer by untargeted metabolomics	candidate biomarkers, chronic gastritis, gastric cancer, lipid metabolism, untargeted metabolomics	PURPOSE: Gastric cancer is a common tumor of the digestive system. Identification of potential molecules associated with gastric cancer progression and validation of potential biomarkers for gastric cancer diagnosis are very important. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the serum metabolic characteristics of the serum of patients with chronic gastritis (CG) or gastric cancer (GC) and validate candidate biomarkers for disease diagnosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 123 human serum samples from patients with CG or GC were collected for untargeted metabolomic analysis via UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS to determine characteristics of the serum. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and heat map were used for multivariate analysis. In addition, commercial databases were used to identify the pathways of metabolites. Differential metabolites were identified based on a heat map with a t-test threshold (p < 0.05), fold-change threshold (FC > 1.5 or FC < 2/3) and variable importance in the projection (VIP >1). Then, differential metabolites were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine candidate biomarkers. All samples were analyzed for fasting lipid profiles. RESULTS: Analysis of serum metabolomic profiles indicated that most of the altered metabolic pathways in the three groups were associated with lipid metabolism (p < 0.05) and lipids and lipid-like molecules were the predominating metabolites within the top 100 differential metabolites (p < 0.05, FC > 1.5 or FC < 2/3, and VIP >1). Moreover, differential metabolites, including hexadecasphinganine, linoleamide, and N-Hydroxy arachidonoyl amine had high diagnostic performance according to PLS-DA. In addition, fasting lipid profile analysis showed the serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1) were decreased concomitant to the progression of the progression of the disease compared with those in the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this study demonstrated that lipid metabolism may influence the development of CG to GC. Hexadecasphinganine, linoleamide, and N-Hydroxy arachidonoyl amine were selected as candidate diagnostic markers for CG and GC.
PXD023024	33777943	EGF Induces Migration Independent of EMT or Invasion in A549 Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells. 	EGF Induces Migration Independent of EMT or Invasion in A549 Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells	EGF, Lung adenocarcinoma, TGFbeta, cancer cell migration, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, invasiveness	Tumors and the tumor microenvironment produce multiple growth factors that influence cancer cell behavior via various signal transduction pathways. Growth factors, like transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), have been shown to induce proliferation, migration, and invasion in different cell models. Both factors are frequently overexpressed in cancer and will often act in combination. Although both factors are being used as rational targets in clinical oncology, the similarities and differences of their contributions to cancer cell migration and invasion are not fully understood. Here we compared the impact of treating A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells with TGFbeta, EGF, and both in combination by applying videomicroscopy, functional assays, immunoblotting, real-time PCR, and proteomics. Treatment with both factors stimulated A549 migration to a similar extent, but with different kinetics. The combination had an additive effect. EGF-induced migration depended on activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. However, this pathway was dispensable for TGFbeta-induced migration, despite a strong activation of this pathway by TGFbeta. Proteome analysis (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD023024) revealed an overlap in expression patterns of migration-related proteins and associated gene ontology (GO) terms by TGFbeta and EGF. Further, only TGFbeta induced the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins like matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). EGF, in contrast, made no major contribution to EMT marker expression on either the protein or the transcript level. In line with these expression patterns, TGFbeta treatment significantly increased the invasive capacity of A549 cells, while EGF treatment did not. Moreover, the addition of EGF failed to enhance TGFbeta-induced invasion. Overall, these data suggest that TGFbeta and EGF can partly compensate for each other for stimulation of cell migration, but abrogation of TGFbeta signaling may be more suitable to suppress cell invasion.
PXD022702	33777990	Heat-Treatments Affect Protease Activities and Peptide Profiles of Ruminants' Milk. 	Heat-treatments affect protease activities and peptide profiles of ruminants' milk	milk, peptidomics	Proteases present in milk are heat-sensitive, and their activities increase or decrease depending on the intensity of the thermal treatment applied. The thermal effects on the protease activity are well-known for bovine milk but poorly understood for ovine and caprine milk. This study aimed to determine the non-specific and specific protease activities in casein and whey fractions isolated from raw bovine, ovine, and caprine milk collected in early lactation, and to determine the effects of low-temperature, long-time (63degreesC for 30 min) and high-temperature, short-time (85degreesC for 5 min) treatments on protease activities within each milk fraction. The non-specific protease activities in raw and heat-treated milk samples were determined using the substrate azocasein. Plasmin (the main protease in milk) and plasminogen-derived activities were determined using the chromogenic substrate S-2251 (D-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA dihydrochloride). Peptides were characterized using high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The activity of all native proteases, shown as non-specific proteases, was similar between raw bovine and caprine milk samples, but lower (P < 0.05) than raw ovine milk in the whey fraction. There was no difference (P > 0.05) between the non-specific protease activity of the casein fraction of raw bovine and caprine milk samples; both had higher activity than ovine milk. After 63degreesC/30 min, the non-specific protease activity decreased (44%; P > 0.05) for the bovine casein fraction only. In contrast, the protease activity of the milk heated at 85degreesC/5 min changed depending on the species and fraction. For instance, the activity decreased by 49% for ovine whey fraction, but it increased by 68% for ovine casein fraction. Plasmin and plasminogen were in general inactivated (P > 0.05) when all milk fractions were heated at 85degreesC/5 min. Most of the peptides present in heat-treated milk were derived from beta-casein and alphaS1-casein, and they matched the hydrolysis profile of cathepsin D and plasmin. Identified peptides in ruminant milk samples had purported immunomodulatory and inhibitory functions. These findings indicate that the non-specific protease activity in whey and casein fractions differed between ruminant milk species, and specific thermal treatments could be used to retain better protease activity for all ruminant milk species.
PXD023659	33779727	Limited proteolysis by acrosin affects sperm-binding and mechanical resilience of the mouse zona pellucida. 	Specificity of the protase acrosin in zona pellucida proteins	acrosin, fetuin-B, mammalian fertilization, ovastacin, zona pellucida	The encounter of oocyte and sperm is the key event initiating embryonic development in mammals. Crucial functions of this existential interaction are determined by proteolytic enzymes, such as acrosin, carried in the sperm head acrosome, and ovastacin, stored in the oocyte cortical granules. Ovastacin is released upon fertilisation to cleave the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein matrix surrounding the oocyte. This limited proteolysis hardens the oocyte envelope, and thereby provides a definitive block against polyspermy and protects the developing embryo. On the other hand, acrosin, the renowned and most abundant acrosomal protease, has been thought to enable sperm to penetrate the oocyte envelope. Depending on the species, proteolytic cleavage of the zona pellucida by acrosin is either essential or conducive for fertilisation. However, the specific target cleavage sites and the resulting physiological consequences of this proteolysis remained obscure. Here, we treated native mouse zonae pellucidae with active acrosin and identified two cleavage sites in zona pellucida protein 1 (ZP1), five in ZP2 and one in ZP3 by mass spectrometry. Several of these sites are highly conserved in mammals. Remarkably, limited proteolysis by acrosin leads to zona pellucida remodelling rather than degradation. Thus, acrosin affects both sperm binding and mechanical resilience of the zona pellucida, as assessed by microscopy and nanoindentation measurements, respectively. Furthermore, we ascertained potential regulatory effects of acrosin, via activation of latent pro-ovastacin and inactivation of fetuin-B, a tight binding inhibitor of ovastacin. These results offer novel insights into the complex proteolytic network modifying the extracellular matrix of the mouse oocyte, which might apply also to other species.
PXD022424	33782401	Profiling PRMT methylome reveals roles of hnRNPA1 arginine methylation in RNA splicing and cell growth. 	Proteomics profiling of arginine methylation mediated by PRMT family reveals a critical role of arginine methylation in RNA splicing and cancer cell growth	PRMTs, RNA splicing, arginine methylation	Numerous substrates have been identified for Type I and II arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). However, the full substrate spectrum of the only type III PRMT, PRMT7, and its connection to type I and II PRMT substrates remains unknown. Here, we use mass spectrometry to reveal features of PRMT7-regulated methylation. We find that PRMT7 predominantly methylates a glycine and arginine motif; multiple PRMT7-regulated arginine methylation sites are close to phosphorylations sites; methylation sites and proximal sequences are vulnerable to cancer mutations; and methylation is enriched in proteins associated with spliceosome and RNA-related pathways. We show that PRMT4/5/7-mediated arginine methylation regulates hnRNPA1 binding to RNA and several alternative splicing events. In breast, colorectal and prostate cancer cells, PRMT4/5/7 are upregulated and associated with high levels of hnRNPA1 arginine methylation and aberrant alternative splicing. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT4/5/7 suppresses cancer cell growth and their co-inhibition shows synergistic effects, suggesting them as targets for cancer therapy.
PXD024228	33782411	The folate cycle enzyme MTHFD2 induces cancer immune evasion through PD-L1 up-regulation. 	Metabolomics in pancreatic cancer cells influenced by MTHFD2	Metabolomics in pancreatic cancer cells influenced by MTHFD2	Metabolic enzymes and metabolites display non-metabolic functions in immune cell signalling that modulate immune attack ability. However, whether and how a tumour's metabolic remodelling contributes to its immune resistance remain to be clarified. Here we perform a functional screen of metabolic genes that rescue tumour cells from effector T cell cytotoxicity, and identify the embryo- and tumour-specific folate cycle enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2). Mechanistically, MTHFD2 promotes basal and IFN-gamma-stimulated PD-L1 expression, which is necessary for tumourigenesis in vivo. Moreover, IFN-gamma stimulates MTHFD2 through the AKT-mTORC1 pathway. Meanwhile, MTHFD2 drives the folate cycle to sustain sufficient uridine-related metabolites including UDP-GlcNAc, which promotes the global O-GlcNAcylation of proteins including cMYC, resulting in increased cMYC stability and PD-L1 transcription. Consistently, the O-GlcNAcylation level positively correlates with MTHFD2 and PD-L1 in pancreatic cancer patients. These findings uncover a non-metabolic role for MTHFD2 in cell signalling and cancer biology.
PXD019735	33783866	Molecular changes of Arabidopsis thaliana plastoglobules facilitate thylakoid membrane remodeling under high light stress. 	Plastoglobules BN-PAGE experiment (Arabidopsis PGs under unstress and high light conditions)	Orbitrap, Plastoglobules, light stress	Plants require rapid responses to adapt to environmental stresses. This includes dramatic changes in the size and number of plastoglobule lipid droplets within chloroplasts. Although the morphological changes of plastoglobules are well documented, little is known about the corresponding molecular changes. To address this gap, we have compared the quantitative proteome, oligomeric state, prenyl-lipid content and kinase activities of Arabidopsis thaliana plastoglobules under unstressed and 5-day light-stressed conditions. Our results show a specific recruitment of proteins related to leaf senescence and jasmonic acid biosynthesis under light stress, and identify nearly half of the plastoglobule proteins in high native molecular weight masses. Additionally, a specific increase in plastoglobule carotenoid abundance under the light stress was consistent with enhanced thylakoid disassembly and leaf senescence, supporting a specific role for plastoglobules in senescence and thylakoid remodeling as an intermediate storage site for photosynthetic pigments. In vitro kinase assays of isolated plastoglobules demonstrated kinase activity towards multiple target proteins, which was more pronounced in the plastoglobules of unstressed than light-stressed leaf tissue, and which was diminished in plastoglobules of the abc1k1/abc1k3 double-mutant. These results strongly suggest that plastoglobule-localized ABC1 kinases hold endogenous kinase activity, as these were the only known or putative kinases identified in the isolated plastoglobules by deep bottom-up proteomics. Collectively, our study reveals targeted changes to the protein and prenyl-lipid composition of plastoglobules under light stress that present strategies by which plastoglobules appear to facilitate stress adaptation within chloroplasts.
PXD014994	33783990	Quantitative acetylome analysis reveals histone modifications that may predict prognosis in hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma. 	Quantitative acetylome analysis reveals histone modifications that may predict prognosis in hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Cancer (B/D-HPP), China Human Proteome Project (CNHPP), Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Liver (B/D-HPP), histone, lysine acetylation, prognosis fa	Lysine acetylation (Kac) as an important posttranslational modification of histones is essential for the regulation of gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the atlas of whole acetylated proteins in HCC tissues and the difference in protein acetylation between normal human tissues and HCC tissues are unknown. In this report, we characterized the proteome and acetyl proteome (acetylome) profile of normal, paracancerous, and HCC liver tissues in human clinical samples by quantitative proteomics techniques. We identified 6781 acetylation sites of 2582 proteins and quantified 2492 acetylation sites of 1190 proteins in normal, paracancerous, and HCC liver tissues. Among them, 15 proteins were multiacetylated with more than 10 lysine residues. The histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP were found to be hyperacetylated in hepatitis B virus pathway. Moreover, we found that 250 Kac sites of 214 proteins were upregulated and 662 Kac sites of 451 proteins were downregulated in HCC compared with normal liver tissues. Additionally, the acetylation levels of lysine 120 in histone H2B (H2BK120ac), lysine 18 in histone H3.3 (H3.3K18ac), and lysine 77 in histone H4 (H4K77ac) were increased in HCC. Interestingly, the higher levels of H2BK120ac, H3.3K18ac, and H4K77ac were significantly associated with worse prognosis, such as poorer survival and higher recurrence in an independent clinical cohort of HCC patients. Overall, this study lays a foundation for understanding the functions of acetylation in HCC and provides potential prognostic factors for the diagnosis and therapy of HCC.
PXD016238	33785583	ADAM10-Mediated Ectodomain Shedding Is an Essential Driver of Podocyte Damage. 	Analysis of mouse glomerular cells		BACKGROUND: Podocytes embrace the glomerular capillaries with foot processes, which are interconnected by a specialized adherens junction to ultimately form the filtration barrier. Altered adhesion and loss are common features of podocyte injury, which could be mediated by shedding of cell-adhesion molecules through the regulated activity of cell surface-expressed proteases. A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) is such a protease known to mediate ectodomain shedding of adhesion molecules, among others. Here we evaluate the involvement of ADAM10 in the process of antibody-induced podocyte injury. METHODS: Membrane proteomics, immunoblotting, high-resolution microscopy, and immunogold electron microscopy were used to analyze human and murine podocyte ADAM10 expression in health and kidney injury. The functionality of ADAM10 ectodomain shedding for podocyte development and injury was analyzed, in vitro and in vivo, in the anti-podocyte nephritis (APN) model in podocyte-specific, ADAM10-deficient mice. RESULTS: ADAM10 is selectively localized at foot processes of murine podocytes and its expression is dispensable for podocyte development. Podocyte ADAM10 expression is induced in the setting of antibody-mediated injury in humans and mice. Podocyte ADAM10 deficiency attenuates the clinical course of APN and preserves the morphologic integrity of podocytes, despite subepithelial immune-deposit formation. Functionally, ADAM10-related ectodomain shedding results in cleavage of the cell-adhesion proteins N- and P-cadherin, thus decreasing their injury-related surface levels. This favors podocyte loss and the activation of downstream signaling events through the Wnt signaling pathway in an ADAM10-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: ADAM10-mediated ectodomain shedding of injury-related cadherins drives podocyte injury.
PXD024647	33785758	Small extracellular vesicles derived from interferon-gamma pre-conditioned mesenchymal stromal cells effectively treat liver fibrosis. 	proteomics of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) stimulated with or without IFN-gamma	mesenchymal stem cells, small extracellular vesicle	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are used for ameliorating liver fibrosis and aiding liver regeneration after cirrhosis; Here, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) pre-conditioned MSCs (gamma-sEVs). gamma-sEVs effectively induced anti-inflammatory macrophages with high motility and phagocytic abilities in vitro, while not preventing hepatic stellate cell (HSC; the major source of collagen fiber) activation in vitro. The proteome analysis of MSC-derived sEVs revealed anti-inflammatory macrophage inducible proteins (e.g., annexin-A1, lactotransferrin, and aminopeptidase N) upon IFN-gamma stimulation. Furthermore, by enabling CX3CR1+ macrophage accumulation in the damaged area, gamma-sEVs ameliorated inflammation and fibrosis in the cirrhosis mouse model more effectively than sEVs. Single cell RNA-Seq analysis revealed diverse effects, such as induction of anti-inflammatory macrophages and regulatory T cells, in the cirrhotic liver after gamma-sEV administration. Overall, IFN-gamma pre-conditioning altered sEVs resulted in efficient tissue repair indicating a new therapeutic strategy.
PXD024053	33789985	Integral Use of Immunopeptidomics and Immunoinformatics for the Characterization of Antigen Presentation and Rational Identification of BoLA-DR-Presented Peptides and Epitopes. 	BoLA-DRimmunopeptidomics in Theileria parva infected, bovine cell lines	Bovine leukocyte antigen, MHC, Theileria parva, immunppeptidomics	MHC peptide binding and presentation is the most selective event defining the landscape of T cell epitopes. Consequently, understanding the diversity of MHC alleles in a given population and the parameters that define the set of ligands that can be bound and presented by each of these alleles (the immunopeptidome) has an enormous impact on our capacity to predict and manipulate the potential of protein Ags to elicit functional T cell responses. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of MHC-eluted ligand data has proven to be a powerful technique for identifying such peptidomes, and methods integrating such data for prediction of Ag presentation have reached a high level of accuracy for both MHC class I and class II. In this study, we demonstrate how these techniques and prediction methods can be readily extended to the bovine leukocyte Ag class II DR locus (BoLA-DR). BoLA-DR binding motifs were characterized by eluted ligand data derived from bovine cell lines expressing a range of DRB3 alleles prevalent in Holstein-Friesian populations. The model generated (NetBoLAIIpan, available as a Web server at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetBoLAIIpan) was shown to have unprecedented predictive power to identify known BoLA-DR-restricted CD4 epitopes. In summary, the results demonstrate the power of an integrated approach combining advanced mass spectrometry peptidomics with immunoinformatics for characterization of the BoLA-DR Ag presentation system and provide a prediction tool that can be used to assist in rational evaluation and selection of bovine CD4 T cell epitopes.
PXD021365	33790014	Structure of Gcn1 bound to stalled and colliding 80S ribosomes. 	Analysis of Gcn20 pullout samples by mass spectrometry	Gcn1, Gcn2, Gcn20, ribosome, translation	The Gcn pathway is conserved in all eukaryotes, including mammals such as humans, where it is a crucial part of the integrated stress response (ISR). Gcn1 serves as an essential effector protein for the kinase Gcn2, which in turn is activated by stalled ribosomes, leading to phosphorylation of eIF2 and a subsequent global repression of translation. The fine-tuning of this adaptive response is performed by the Rbg2/Gir2 complex, a negative regulator of Gcn2. Despite the wealth of available biochemical data, information on structures of Gcn proteins on the ribosome has remained elusive. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the yeast Gcn1 protein in complex with stalled and colliding 80S ribosomes. Gcn1 interacts with both 80S ribosomes within the disome, such that the Gcn1 HEAT repeats span from the P-stalk region on the colliding ribosome to the P-stalk and the A-site region of the lead ribosome. The lead ribosome is stalled in a nonrotated state with peptidyl-tRNA in the A-site, uncharged tRNA in the P-site, eIF5A in the E-site, and Rbg2/Gir2 in the A-site factor binding region. By contrast, the colliding ribosome adopts a rotated state with peptidyl-tRNA in a hybrid A/P-site, uncharged-tRNA in the P/E-site, and Mbf1 bound adjacent to the mRNA entry channel on the 40S subunit. Collectively, our findings reveal the interaction mode of the Gcn2-activating protein Gcn1 with colliding ribosomes and provide insight into the regulation of Gcn2 activation. The binding of Gcn1 to a disome has important implications not only for the Gcn2-activated ISR, but also for the general ribosome-associated quality control pathways.
PXD022840	33791294	Tetramethylpyrazine Improves Cognitive Impairment and Modifies the Hippocampal Proteome in Two Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease. 	Tetramethylpyrazine improves cognitive impairment and modifies the hippocampal proteome in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease	Alzheimer's disease (AD), Mitochondria, OXPHOS, Tetramethylpyrazine	Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, has no effective treatment. We studied the potential effects of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), an alkaloid in the rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (chuanxiong) to treat ischemic stroke, on AD progression in two AD mouse models. Eight-month-old 3xTg-AD mice received TMP treatment (10 mg/kg/d) for 1 month, and 4-month-old APP/PS1-AD mice received TMP treatment (10 mg/kg/d) for 2 months. Behavioral tests, including step-down passive avoidance (SDA), new object recognition (NOR), Morris water maze (MWM), and Contextual fear conditioning test showed that TMP significantly improved the learning and memory of the two AD-transgenic mice. In addition, TMP reduced beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels and tau phosphorylation (p-tau). Venny map pointed out that 116 proteins were commonly changed in 3xTg mice vs. wild type (WT) mice and TMP-treated mice vs. -untreated mice. The same 130 proteins were commonly changed in APP/PS1 mice vs. WT mice and TMP-treated mice vs. -untreated mice. The functions of the common proteins modified by TMP in the two models were mainly involved in mitochondrial, synaptic, cytoskeleton, ATP binding, and GTP binding. Mitochondrial omics analysis revealed 21 and 20 differentially expressed mitochondrial proteins modified by TMP in 3xTg-AD mice and APP/PS1 mice, respectively. These differential proteins were located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondrial outer membrane, mitochondrial gap, and mitochondrial matrix, and the function of some proteins is closely related to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Western-blot analysis confirmed that TMP changed the expression of OXPHOS complex proteins (sdhb, ndufa10, uqcrfs1, cox5b, atp5a) in the hippocampus of the two AD mice. Taken together, we demonstrated that TMP treatment changed the hippocampal proteome, reduced AD pathology, and reduced cognitive impairment in the two AD models. The changes might be associated with modification of the mitochondrial protein profile by TMP. The results of the study suggest that TMP can improve the symptoms of AD.
PXD021400	33791430	Broad Spectrum Antibiotic Xanthocillin X Effectively Kills Acinetobacter baumannii via Dysregulation of Heme Biosynthesis. 	Xanthocillin X Effectively Kills A.Baumannii via Dysregulation of Heme Biosynthesis	Antibiotics, Isonitriles	Isonitrile natural products exhibit promising antibacterial activities. However, their mechanism of action (MoA) remains largely unknown. Based on the nanomolar potency of xanthocillin X (Xan) against diverse difficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacteria, including the critical priority pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, we performed in-depth studies to decipher its MoA. While neither metal binding nor cellular protein targets were detected as relevant for Xan's antibiotic effects, sequencing of resistant strains revealed a conserved mutation in the heme biosynthesis enzyme porphobilinogen synthase (PbgS). This mutation caused impaired enzymatic efficiency indicative of reduced heme production. This discovery led to the validation of an untapped mechanism, by which direct heme sequestration of Xan prevents its binding into cognate enzyme pockets resulting in uncontrolled cofactor biosynthesis, accumulation of porphyrins, and corresponding stress with deleterious effects for bacterial viability. Thus, Xan represents a promising antibiotic displaying activity even against multidrug resistant strains, while exhibiting low toxicity to human cells.
PXD009272	33792664	INPP5K and SIL1 associated pathologies with overlapping clinical phenotypes converge through dysregulation of PHGDH. 	INPP5K and SIL1 associated pathologies with overlapping clinical phenotypes converge through dysregulation of PHGDH	BiP, INPP5K, L-serine, PHGDH, SIL1	Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome is a rare human disorder caused by biallelic mutations in SIL1 characterized by cataracts in infancy, myopathy and ataxia, symptoms which are also associated with a novel disorder caused by mutations in INPP5K. While these phenotypic similarities may suggest commonalties at a molecular level, an overlapping pathomechanism has not been established yet. In this study, we present six new INPP5K patients and expand the current mutational and phenotypical spectrum of the disease showing the clinical overlap between Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome and the INPP5K phenotype. We applied unbiased proteomic profiling on cells derived from Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome and INPP5K patients and identified alterations in d-3-PHGDH as a common molecular feature. d-3-PHGDH modulates the production of l-serine and mutations in this enzyme were previously associated with a neurological phenotype, which clinically overlaps with Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome and INPP5K disease. As l-serine administration represents a promising therapeutic strategy for d-3-PHGDH patients, we tested the effect of l-serine in generated sil1, phgdh and inpp5k a+b zebrafish models, which showed an improvement in their neuronal phenotype. Thus, our study defines a core phenotypical feature underpinning a key common molecular mechanism in three rare diseases and reveals a common and novel therapeutic target for these patients.
PXD024602	33793249	Nuclear Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptor A3 Is Monomeric and Is Involved in Multiple Layers of Regulated Gene Expression and Translation. 	LILRA3-GFP and GFP only Transfected HEK293T cells LC-MSMS	HEK293T cells, Human Proteome Project, Immunoprecipitation, LILRA3, ProteomeXchange project tag: Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)	The leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A3 (LILRA3) is a soluble protein primarily expressed by peripheral blood monocytes and is abundant in sera of healthy donors. Extracellular LILRA3 is anti-inflammatory and displays neuro-regenerative functions in vitro. However, its intracellular expression, distribution, and function(s) remain unknown. Using a combination of high-resolution confocal and super-resolution microscopy, we identified intracellular expression of native LILRA3 in the nucleus of peripheral blood monocytes and in vitro-derived macrophages. This unexpected nuclear localization of LILRA3 was confirmed in LILRA3-GFP-transfected HEK293T cells. Western blot of proteins fractionated from primary macrophages and the transfected HEK293T cells confirmed nuclear localization of the native and expressed LILRA3 proteins. Interestingly, most of the LILRA3 in the nucleus was in a monomeric form like the biologically active secreted protein, while that in the other cellular compartments was in mixed monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric forms. The predominant presence of monomeric LILRA3 in the nucleus was independently corroborated in transfected live HEK293T cells using the number and molecular brightness (N&B) analysis method. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric peptide sequencing studies revealed that nuclear LILRA3 co-immunoprecipitated with several nuclear proteins involved in host protein synthesis machinery via direct interactions to a key multifunctional RNA-binding protein, the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 protein (EWS) (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD024602). The biological significance of the nuclear expression of LILRA3 and its interaction with these key proteins remain to be elucidated.
PXD020025	33793824	Analysis of a photosynthetic cyanobacterium rich in internal membrane systems via gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq). 	Grad-Seq analysis of a photosynthetic bacterium rich in internal membrane systems	RNA-binding proteins, cyanobacteria, post-transcriptional regulation, ribonucleoprotein complexes, small regulatory RNAs	Although regulatory small RNAs have been reported in photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the lack of clear RNA chaperones involved in their regulation poses a conundrum. Here, we analyzed the full complement of cellular RNAs and proteins using gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq) in Synechocystis 6803. Complexes with overlapping subunits such as the CpcG1-type versus the CpcL-type phycobilisomes or the PsaK1 versus PsaK2 photosystem I pre(complexes) could be distinguished, supporting the high quality of this approach. Clustering of the in-gradient distribution profiles followed by several additional criteria yielded a short list of potential RNA chaperones that include an YlxR homolog and a cyanobacterial homolog of the KhpA/B complex. The data suggest previously undetected complexes between accessory proteins and CRISPR-Cas systems, such as a Csx1-Csm6 ribonucleolytic defense complex. Moreover, the exclusive association of either RpoZ or 6S RNA with the core RNA polymerase complex and the existence of a reservoir of inactive sigma-antisigma complexes is suggested. The Synechocystis Grad-seq resource is available online at https://sunshine.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/GradSeqExplorer/ providing a comprehensive resource for the functional assignment of RNA-protein complexes and multisubunit protein complexes in a photosynthetic organism.
PXD021537	33795633	Tissue-specific signatures of metabolites and proteins in asparagus roots and exudates. 	Spatial molecule distribution in asparagus roots	perennial, root, vegetable	Comprehensive untargeted and targeted analysis of root exudate composition has advanced our understanding of rhizosphere processes. However, little is known about exudate spatial distribution and regulation. We studied the specific metabolite signatures of asparagus root exudates, root outer (epidermis and exodermis), and root inner tissues (cortex and vasculature). The greatest differences were found between exudates and root tissues. In total, 263 non-redundant metabolites were identified as significantly differentially abundant between the three root fractions, with the majority being enriched in the root exudate and/or outer tissue and annotated as 'lipids and lipid-like molecules' or 'phenylpropanoids and polyketides'. Spatial distribution was verified for three selected compounds using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry imaging. Tissue-specific proteome analysis related root tissue-specific metabolite distributions and rhizodeposition with underlying biosynthetic pathways and transport mechanisms. The proteomes of root outer and inner tissues were spatially very distinct, in agreement with the fundamental differences between their functions and structures. According to KEGG pathway analysis, the outer tissue proteome was characterized by a high abundance of proteins related to 'lipid metabolism', 'biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites' and 'transport and catabolism', reflecting its main functions of providing a hydrophobic barrier, secreting secondary metabolites, and mediating water and nutrient uptake. Proteins more abundant in the inner tissue related to 'transcription', 'translation' and 'folding, sorting and degradation', in accord with the high activity of cortical and vasculature cell layers in growth- and development-related processes. In summary, asparagus root fractions accumulate specific metabolites. This expands our knowledge of tissue-specific plant cell function.
PXD023963	33795741	Toward the discovery of biological functions associated with the mechanosensor Mtl1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae via integrative multi-OMICs analysis. 	Toward the discovery of biological functions associated with the mechanosensor Mtl1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae via integrative multi-OMICs analysis.	general stress response, metabolome, yeast cell wall integrity, yeast mechanosensors	Functional analysis of the Mtl1 protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed that this transmembrane sensor endows yeast cells with resistance to oxidative stress through a signaling mechanism called the cell wall integrity pathway (CWI). We observed upregulation of multiple heat shock proteins (HSPs), proteins associated with the formation of stress granules, and the phosphatase subunit of trehalose 6-phosphate synthase which suggests that mtl1Delta strains undergo intrinsic activation of a non-lethal heat stress response. Furthermore, quantitative global proteomic analysis conducted on TMT-labeled proteins combined with metabolome analysis revealed that mtl1Delta strains exhibit decreased levels of metabolites of carboxylic acid metabolism, decreased expression of anabolic enzymes and increased expression of catabolic enzymes involved in the metabolism of amino acids, with enhanced expression of mitochondrial respirasome proteins. These observations support the idea that Mtl1 protein controls the suppression of a non-lethal heat stress response under normal conditions while it plays an important role in metabolic regulatory mechanisms linked to TORC1 signaling that are required to maintain cellular homeostasis and optimal mitochondrial function.
PXD021503	33795774	Combining P and Zn fertilization to enhance yield and grain quality in maize grown on Mediterranean soils. 	Combining P and Zn fertilization to enhance yield, grain Zn availability and protein profile in maize grown on Mediterranean soils	Zea mays, grain protein quality, seed storage proteins	The main aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of individual and joint fertilization with P and Zn on maize plants grown on typical Mediterranean soils with a limited Zn availability. For this purpose, we examined the effects of P and Zn fertilization individually and in combination on growth, yield and grain protein content in maize grown in pots filled with three different Mediterranean soils (LCV, FER and INM). Phosphorus and Zn translocation to grain was impaired, and aboveground dry matter and yield at harvest reduced by 8-85% (LCV and FER), in plants treated with Zn or P alone relative to unfertilized (control) plants. In contrast, joint fertilization with P and Zn enhanced translocation of these nutrients to grain and significantly increased aboveground dry matter (30% in LCV, 50% in FER and 250% in INM) and grain Zn availability in comparison with control plants. Also, joint application of both nutrients significantly increased grain P (LCV) and Zn (LCV and FER) use efficiency relative P and Zn, respectively, alone. Yield was increased between 31% in LCV and 121% in FER relative to control plants, albeit not significantly. Fertilization with P or Zn significantly influenced the abundance of specific proteins affecting grain quality (viz., storage, lys-rich and cell wall proteins), which were more abundant in mature grains from plants fertilized with Zn alone and, to a lesser extent, P + Zn. Sustainable strategies in agriculture should consider P-Zn interactions in maize grown on soils with a limited availability of Zn, where Zn fertilization is crucial to ensure grain quality.
PXD023415	33796843	The nucleolus functions as the compartment for histone H2B protein degradation. 	The nucleolus functions as the compartment for histone 1 H2B protein degradation	H2B, nucleolus, polyubiquitination, protein degradation	Histones are main components of chromatin, and the protein levels of histones significantly affect chromatin assembly. However, how histone protein levels are regulated, especially whether and how histones are degraded, is largely unclear. Here, we found that histone H2B is mainly degraded through the proteasome-mediated pathway, and the lysine-120 site of H2B is essential for its K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, the degradation-impaired H2BK120R mutant shows an increased nucleolus localization, and inhibition of the proteasome results in an elevated nucleolus distribution of wild-type H2B, which is similar to that of H2BK120R mutants. More importantly, the nucleolus fractions can ubiquitinate and degrade the purified H2B in vitro, suggesting that the nucleolus, in addition to its canonical roles regulating ribosome genesis and protein translation, likely associates with H2B degradation. Therefore, these findings revealed a novel mechanism for the regulation of H2B degradation in which a nucleolus-associated proteasome pathway is involved.
PXD020821	33797904	Proteome-Wide Analysis of Protein Lysine N-Homocysteinylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 	Proteom-wide analysis of lysine N-homocysteinylation and Hcy-induced proteom changes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	N-homocysteinylation, homocysteine, homocysteine thiolactone, yeast proteome	Protein N-homocysteinylation by a homocysteine (Hcy) metabolite, Hcy-thiolactone, is an emerging post-translational modification (PTM) that occurs in all tested organisms and has been linked to human diseases. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used as a model eukaryotic organism in biomedical research, including studies of protein PTMs. However, patterns of global protein N-homocysteinylation in yeast are not known. Here, we identified 68 in vivo and 197 in vitro N-homocysteinylation sites at protein lysine residues (N-Hcy-Lys). Some of the N-homocysteinylation sites overlap with other previously identified PTM sites. Protein N-homocysteinylation in vivo, induced by supplementation of yeast cultures with Hcy, which elevates Hcy-thiolactone levels, was accompanied by significant changes in the levels of 70 yeast proteins (38 up-regulated and 32 down-regulated) involved in the ribosomal structure, amino acid biosynthesis, and basic cellular pathways. Our study provides the first global survey of N-homocysteinylation and accompanying changes in the yeast proteome caused by elevated Hcy level. These findings suggest that protein N-homocysteinylation and dysregulation of cellular proteostasis may contribute to the toxicity of Hcy in yeast. Homologous proteins and N-homocysteinylation sites are likely to be involved in Hcy-related pathophysiology in humans and experimental animals. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD020821.
PXD014737	33797919	Phosphoproteome Profiling Revealed the Importance of mTOR Inhibition on CDK1 Activation to Further Regulate Cell Cycle Progression. 	Phosphoproteome analysis reveals the importance of Greatwall-endosulfine pathway to regulate cell-cycle progression upon the rapamycin-induced autophagy	CDK1, autophagy, cell cycle, phosphoproteome, rapamycin	The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as a critical regulator of cell cycle progression. However, the underlying mechanism by which mTOR regulates cell cycle progression remains elusive. In this study, we used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture with a two-step strategy for phosphopeptide enrichment and high-throughput quantitative mass spectrometry to perform a global phosphoproteome analysis of mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. By monitoring the phosphoproteome alterations upon rapamycin treatment, downregulation of mTOR signaling pathway was detected and enriched. Further functional analysis of phosphoproteome revealed the involvement of cell cycle events. Specifically, the elevated profile of cell cycle-related substrates was observed, and the activation of CDK1, MAPK1, and MAPK3 kinases was determined. Second, pathway interrogation using kinase inhibitor treatment confirmed that CDK1 activation operated downstream from mTOR inhibition to further regulate cell cycle progression. Third, we found that the activation of CDK1 following 4-12 h of mTOR inhibition was accompanied by the activation of the Greatwall-endosulfine complex. In conclusion, we presented a high-confidence phosphoproteome map inside the cells upon mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. Our data implied that mTOR inhibition could contribute to CDK1 activation for further regulating cell cycle progression, which was mediated by the Greatwall-endosulfine complex.
PXD020165	33799447	Identification of Ku70 Domain-Specific Interactors Using BioID2. 	Using BioID2 to map domain specific Ku70 protein interactors	BioID2, HEK293, Ku70, LC-ESI-MS/MS	Since its inception, proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), an in vivo biochemical screening method to identify proximal protein interactors, has seen extensive developments. Improvements and variants of the original BioID technique are being reported regularly, each expanding upon the existing potential of the original technique. While this is advancing our capabilities to study protein interactions under different contexts, we have yet to explore the full potential of the existing BioID variants already at our disposal. Here, we used BioID2 in an innovative manner to identify and map domain-specific protein interactions for the human Ku70 protein. Four HEK293 cell lines were created, each stably expressing various BioID2-tagged Ku70 segments designed to collectively identify factors that interact with different regions of Ku70. Historically, although many interactions have been mapped to the C-terminus of the Ku70 protein, few have been mapped to the N-terminal von Willebrand A-like domain, a canonical protein-binding domain ideally situated as a site for protein interaction. Using this segmented approach, we were able to identify domain-specific interactors as well as evaluate advantages and drawbacks of the BioID2 technique. Our study identifies several potential new Ku70 interactors and validates RNF113A and Spindly as proteins that contact or co-localize with Ku in a Ku70 vWA domain-specific manner.
PXD024445	33799486	A Multi-Mineral Intervention to Modulate Colonic Mucosal Protein Profile: Results from a 90-Day Trial in Human Subjects. 	A Multi-Mineral Intervention to Modulate Colonic Mucosal Protein Profile: Results from a 90-Day Trial in Human Subjects	Aquamin, biomarkers, calcium, colon cancer chemoprevention, minerals, proteomic analysis, trace elements	The overall goal of this study was to determine whether Aquamin((R)), a calcium-, magnesium-, trace element-rich, red algae-derived natural product, would alter the expression of proteins involved in growth-regulation and differentiation in colon. Thirty healthy human subjects (at risk for colorectal cancer) were enrolled in a three-arm, 90-day interventional trial. Aquamin((R)) was compared to calcium alone and placebo. Before and after the interventional period, colonic biopsies were obtained. Biopsies were evaluated by immunohistology for expression of Ki67 (proliferation marker) and for CK20 and p21 (differentiation markers). Tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry-based detection was used to assess levels of multiple proteins. As compared to placebo or calcium, Aquamin((R)) reduced the level of Ki67 expression and slightly increased CK20 expression. Increased p21 expression was observed with both calcium and Aquamin((R)). In proteomic screen, Aquamin((R)) treatment resulted in many more proteins being upregulated (including pro-apoptotic, cytokeratins, cell-cell adhesion molecules, and components of the basement membrane) or downregulated (proliferation and nucleic acid metabolism) than placebo. Calcium alone also altered the expression of many of the same proteins but not to the same extent as Aquamin((R)). We conclude that daily Aquamin((R)) ingestion alters protein expression profile in the colon that could be beneficial to colonic health.
PXD022782	33799802	Mast Cell-Derived SAMD14 Is a Novel Regulator of the Human Prostate Tumor Microenvironment. 	Mast cell-derived SAMD14 is a novel regulator of the human prostate tumor microenvironment	Prostate cancer, SAMD14, cancer-associated fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, mast cells, tumor microenvironment	Mast cells (MCs) are important cellular components of the tumor microenvironment and are significantly associated with poor patient outcomes in prostate cancer and other solid cancers. The promotion of tumor progression partly involves heterotypic interactions between MCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which combine to potentiate a pro-tumor extracellular matrix and promote epithelial cell invasion and migration. Thus far, the interactions between MCs and CAFs remain poorly understood. To identify molecular changes that may alter resident MC function in the prostate tumor microenvironment, we profiled the transcriptome of human prostate MCs isolated from patient-matched non-tumor and tumor-associated regions of fresh radical prostatectomy tissue. Transcriptomic profiling revealed a distinct gene expression profile of MCs isolated from prostate tumor regions, including the downregulation of SAMD14, a putative tumor suppressor gene. Proteomic profiling revealed that overexpression of SAMD14 in HMC-1 altered the secretion of proteins associated with immune regulation and extracellular matrix processes. To assess MC biological function within a model of the prostate tumor microenvironment, HMC-1-SAMD14+ conditioned media was added to co-cultures of primary prostatic CAFs and prostate epithelium. HMC-1-SAMD14+ secretions were shown to reduce the deposition and alignment of matrix produced by CAFs and suppress pro-tumorigenic prostate epithelial morphology. Overall, our data present the first profile of human MCs derived from prostate cancer patient specimens and identifies MC-derived SAMD14 as an important mediator of MC phenotype and function within the prostate tumor microenvironment.
PXD023782	33800973	Proteomics Data Analysis for the Identification of Proteins and Derived Proteotypic Peptides of Potential Use as Putative Drought Tolerance Markers for Quercus ilex. 	Proteomics data analysis for the identification of proteins and derived proteotypic peptides to be used as drought tolerance markers in Quercus ilex	Quercus ilex, drought tolerance, peptides markers, targeted post-acquisition proteomics	Drought is one of the main causes of mortality in holm oak (Quercus ilex) seedlings used in reforestation programs. Although this species shows high adaptability to the extreme climate conditions prevailing in Southern Spain, its intrinsic genetic variability may play a role in the differential response of some populations and individuals. The aim of this work was to identify proteins and derived proteotypic peptides potentially useful as putative markers for drought tolerance in holm oak by using a targeted post-acquisition proteomics approach. For this purpose, we used a set of proteins identified by shotgun (LC-MSMS) analysis in a drought experiment on Q. ilex seedlings from four different provenances (viz. the Andalusian provinces Granada, Huelva, Cadiz and Seville). A double strategy involving the quantification of proteins and target peptides by shotgun analysis and post-acquisition data analysis based on proteotypic peptides was used. To this end, an initial list of proteotypic peptides from proteins highly represented under drought conditions was compiled that was used in combination with the raw files from the shotgun experiment to quantify the relative abundance of the fragment's ion peaks with the software Skyline. The most abundant peptides under drought conditions in at least two populations were selected as putative markers of drought tolerance. A total of 30 proteins and 46 derived peptides belonging to the redox, stress-related, synthesis,-folding and degradation, and primary and secondary metabolism functional groups were thus identified. Two proteins (viz., subtilisin and chaperone GrpE protein) were found at increased levels in three populations, which make them especially interesting for validation drought tolerance markers in subsequent experiments.
PXD022899	33802194	Deciphering the Proteotoxic Stress Responses Triggered by the Perturbed Thylakoid Proteostasis in Arabidopsis. 	Analysis of thylakoid membrane proteome in Arabidopsis thaliana	spectral count	Here, we explored heat dependent thylakoid FtsH protease substrates and investigated proteotoxicity induced by thermal damage and processive protease dysfunction on the thylakoid membrane. Through our thylakoid enriched proteome analysis and biochemical experiments, carbonylated stromal proteins were suggested as possible FtsH targets. Furthermore, we observed in the thylakoid fractions in the absence of FtsH stromal reactive oxygen species-detoxifying enzymes, as well as heat shock proteins and chaperones, which are known to be upregulated at the transcriptional level when this protease is absent, which is called the damaged protein response, resembling unfolded protein response in eukaryotic cells. Interestingly, the thylakoid-enriched high-density fractions included stromal translation factors and RNA-binding proteins, along with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, reminiscent of the formation of stress granules. Unexpectedly, extraplastid proteins such as mitochondrial chaperones, peroxidase, tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiratory chain enzymes, as well as cytosolic ribosomes, translation factors, heat shock proteins, antioxidants and metabolic enzymes, were also found deposited in the high-density fractions depending on the loss of thylakoid FtsH, with more prominent effects of thermal stress on the cytosolic proteins. This may reflect intracellular adaptation to the proteotoxic influences from the organelle.
PXD024210	33803212	Ferlins and TgDOC2 in Toxoplasma Microneme, Rhoptry and Dense Granule Secretion. 	Ferlins and TgDOC2 in Toxoplasma microneme, rhoptry and dense granule secretion	Toxoplasma gondii, secretion	The host cell invasion process of apicomplexan parasites like Toxoplasma gondii is facilitated by sequential exocytosis of the microneme, rhoptry and dense granule organelles. Exocytosis is facilitated by a double C2 domain (DOC2) protein family. This class of C2 domains is derived from an ancestral calcium (Ca(2+)) binding archetype, although this feature is optional in extant C2 domains. DOC2 domains provide combinatorial power to the C2 domain, which is further enhanced in ferlins that harbor 5-7 C2 domains. Ca(2+) conditionally engages the C2 domain with lipids, membranes, and/or proteins to facilitating vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion. The widely conserved T. gondii ferlins 1 (FER1) and 2 (FER2) are responsible for microneme and rhoptry exocytosis, respectively, whereas an unconventional TgDOC2 is essential for microneme exocytosis. The general role of ferlins in endolysosmal pathways is consistent with the repurposed apicomplexan endosomal pathways in lineage specific secretory organelles. Ferlins can facilitate membrane fusion without SNAREs, again pertinent to the Apicomplexa. How temporal raises in Ca(2+) combined with spatiotemporally available membrane lipids and post-translational modifications mesh to facilitate sequential exocytosis events is discussed. In addition, new data on cross-talk between secretion events together with the identification of a new microneme protein, MIC21, is presented.
PXD018702	33803263	Identification of Decrease in TRiC Proteins as Novel Targets of Alpha-Amanitin-Derived Hepatotoxicity by Comparative Proteomic Analysis In Vitro. 	Characterization of protein dynamics after alpha-amanitin exposure in hepatoma cells	TRiC, alpha-amanitin, comparative quantitative proteomics, hepatotoxicity	Alpha-amanitin (alpha-AMA) is a cyclic peptide and one of the most lethal mushroom amatoxins found in Amanita phalloides. alpha-AMA is known to cause hepatotoxicity through RNA polymerase II inhibition, which acts in RNA and DNA translocation. To investigate the toxic signature of alpha-AMA beyond known mechanisms, we used quantitative nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis coupled with tandem mass tag labeling to examine proteome dynamics in Huh-7 human hepatoma cells treated with toxic concentrations of alpha-AMA. Among the 1828 proteins identified, we quantified 1563 proteins, which revealed that four subunits in the T-complex protein 1-ring complex protein decreased depending on the alpha-AMA concentration. We conducted bioinformatics analyses of the quantified proteins to characterize the toxic signature of alpha-AMA in hepatoma cells. This is the first report of global changes in proteome abundance with variations in alpha-AMA concentration, and our findings suggest a novel molecular regulation mechanism for hepatotoxicity.
PXD019861	33803797	Proteomic Analysis of Mycelial Exudates of Ustilaginoidea virens. 	Proteomic analysis of mycelial exudate of Ustilaginoidea virens	Exudate, LC-MS, Ustilaginoidea virens	Rice false smut (RFS) disease, which is caused by Ustilaginoidea virens, has been widespread all over the world in recent years, causing irreversible losses. Under artificial culture conditions, exudates will appear on colonies of U. virens during the growth of the hyphae. Exudation of droplets is a common feature in many fungi, but the functions of exudates are undetermined. As the executors of life functions, proteins can intuitively reflect the functions of exudates. Shotgun proteomics were used in this study. A total of 650 proteins were identified in the exudate of U. virens, and the raw data were made available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD019861. There were 57 subcategories and 167 pathways annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, respectively. Through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, it was found that 20 proteins participated in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Two separate PPI analyses were performed for carbon metabolism and microbial metabolism in diverse environments. After comparing and annotating the functions of proteins of the exudate, it was speculated that the exudate was involved in the construction and remodeling of the fungal cell wall. Pathogenicity, sporulation, and antioxidant effects might all be affected by the exudate.
PXD019233	33804713	A Proteomics Study on the Mechanism of Nutmeg-Induced Hepatotoxicity. 	chronic exposure to tramadol induces oxidative damage, inflammation based on mice serum proteome	mice, serum	Nutmeg is a traditional spice and medicinal plant with a variety of pharmacological activities. However, nutmeg abuse due to its hallucinogenic characteristics and poisoning cases are frequently reported. Our previous metabolomics study proved the hepatotoxicity of nutmeg and demonstrated that high-dose nutmeg can affect the synthesis and secretion of bile acids and cause oxidative stress. In order to further investigate the hepatotoxicity of nutmeg, normal saline, 1 g/kg, 4 g/kg nutmeg were administrated to male Kunming mice by intragastrical gavage for 7 days. Histopathological investigation of liver tissue, proteomics and biochemical analysis were employed to explore the mechanism of liver damage caused by nutmeg. The results showed that a high-dose (4 g/kg) of nutmeg can cause significant increased level of CYP450s and depletion of antioxidants, resulting in obvious oxidative stress damage and lipid metabolism disorders; but this change was not observed in low-dose group (1 g/kg). In addition, the increased level of malondialdehyde and decreased level of glutathione peroxidase were found after nutmeg exposure. Therefore, the present study reasonably speculates that nutmeg exposure may lead to liver injury through oxidative stress and the degree of this damage is related to the exposure dose.
PXD024061	33805243	Label-Free Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Nitrogen Starvation in Arabidopsis Root Reveals New Aspects of H2S Signaling by Protein Persulfidation. 	Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of nitrogen starvation in Arabidopsis root reveals new aspects of H2S signaling by protein persulfidation	Hydrogen sulfide mediated signaling pathways, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS	Hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-mediated signaling pathways regulate many physiological and pathophysiological processes in mammalian and plant systems. The molecular mechanism by which hydrogen sulfide exerts its action involves the posttranslational modification of cysteine residues to form a persulfidated thiol motif. We developed a comparative and label-free quantitative proteomic analysis approach for the detection of endogenous persulfidated proteins in N-starved Arabidopsis thaliana roots by using the tag-switch method. In this work, we identified 5214 unique proteins from root tissue that were persulfidated, 1674 of which were quantitatively analyzed and found to show altered persulfidation levels in vivo under N deprivation. These proteins represented almost 13% of the entire annotated proteome in Arabidopsis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that persulfidated proteins were involved in a wide range of biological functions, regulating important processes such as primary metabolism, plant responses to stresses, growth and development, RNA translation and protein degradation. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis allowed us to obtain a comprehensive view of hydrogen sulfide signaling via changes in the persulfidation levels of key protein targets involved in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and autophagy, among others.
PXD024767	33806155	Site-Specific O-Glycosylation Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Produced in Insect and Human Cells. 	1. Site-specific O-glycosylation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein produced in insect and human cells	ETD, LC-MS, N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2	Enveloped viruses hijack not only the host translation processes, but also its glycosylation machinery, and to a variable extent cover viral surface proteins with tolerogenic host-like structures. SARS-CoV-2 surface protein S presents as a trimer on the viral surface and is covered by a dense shield of N-linked glycans, and a few O-glycosites have been reported. The location of O-glycans is controlled by a large family of initiating enzymes with variable expression in cells and tissues and hence is difficult to predict. Here, we used our well-established O-glycoproteomic workflows to map the precise positions of O-linked glycosylation sites on three different entities of protein S-insect cell or human cell-produced ectodomains, or insect cell derived receptor binding domain (RBD). In total 25 O-glycosites were identified, with similar patterns in the two ectodomains of different cell origin, and a distinct pattern of the monomeric RBD. Strikingly, 16 out of 25 O-glycosites were located within three amino acids from known N-glycosites. However, O-glycosylation was primarily found on peptides that were unoccupied by N-glycans, and otherwise had low overall occupancy. This suggests possible complementary functions of O-glycans in immune shielding and negligible effects of O-glycosylation on subunit vaccine design for SARS-CoV-2.
PXD024272	33806404	A Simple Method for In-Depth Proteome Analysis of Mammalian Cell Culture Conditioned Media Containing Fetal Bovine Serum. 	In-depth proteome analysis of Hela cell culture conditioned media containing fetal bovine serum.	Albumin removal, DIA, Fetal bovine serum, Proteome analysis, Secreted Proteins, conditioned medium	A conditioned medium of a cell culture is widely used for various biological applications and frequently analyzed to characterize the functional proteins responsible for observed biological functions. However, a large number of abundant proteins in fetal bovine serum (FBS), usually included in the conditioned medium of a mammalian cell culture medium, hampers in-depth proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For a deep proteomic analysis of a conditioned medium by LC-MS/MS, we developed a simple albumin depletion approach coupled with data-independent acquisition (DIA)-mode LC-MS/MS for the conditioned medium of mammalian cells in this study. The results showed that this approach enabled the detection of more than 3700 cell-derived proteins in the cell culture supernatant containing FBS. We further demonstrated the potency of this approach by analyzing proteins in the conditioned media of HeLa cells with and without tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation: >40 differentially accumulated proteins, including four cytokines, upon TNF stimulation were identified in the culture media, which were hardly detected by conventional proteome approaches in the literature.
PXD018230	33806447	Functional States in Tumor-Initiating Cell Differentiation in Human Colorectal Cancer. 	Functional states in tumor-initiating cell differentiation in human colorectal cancer	colorectal cancer, patient-derived cancer models, single-cell RNA-sequencing, transcriptional programs, tumor cell differentiation, tumor heterogeneity, tumor metabolism, tumor-initiating cells	Intra-tumor heterogeneity of tumor-initiating cell (TIC) activity drives colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and therapy resistance. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing of patient-derived CRC models to decipher distinct cell subpopulations based on their transcriptional profiles. Cell type-specific expression modules of stem-like, transit amplifying-like, and differentiated CRC cells resemble differentiation states of normal intestinal epithelial cells. Strikingly, identified subpopulations differ in proliferative activity and metabolic state. In summary, we here show at single-cell resolution that transcriptional heterogeneity identifies functional states during TIC differentiation. Furthermore, identified expression signatures are linked to patient prognosis. Targeting transcriptional states associated to cancer cell differentiation might unravel novel vulnerabilities in human CRC.
PXD024205	33806494	Calendula officinalis Triterpenoid Saponins Impact the Immune Recognition of Proteins in Parasitic Nematodes. 	The effect of oleanolic acid glucuronides from marigold (Calendula officinalis) on the possible modification of immunogenic proteins from infective Heigmosomoides polygyrus bakeri larvae (L3)	Heligmosomoides polygyrus, L3 stage	The influence of triterpenoid saponins on subcellular morphological changes in the cells of parasitic nematodes remains poorly understood. Our study examines the effect of oleanolic acid glucuronides from marigold (Calendula officinalis) on the possible modification of immunogenic proteins from infective Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri larvae (L3). Our findings indicate that the triterpenoid saponins alter the subcellular morphology of the larvae and prevent recognition of nematode-specific proteins by rabbit immune-IgG. TEM ultrastructure and HPLC analysis showed that microtubule and cytoskeleton fibres were fragmented by saponin treatment. MASCOT bioinformatic analysis revealed that in larvae exposed to saponins, the immune epitopes of their proteins altered. Several mitochondrial and cytoskeleton proteins involved in signalling and cellular processes were downregulated or degraded. As possible candidates, the following set of recognised proteins may play a key role in the immunogenicity of larvae: beta-tubulin isotype, alpha-tubulin, myosin, paramyosin isoform-1, actin, disorganized muscle protein-1, ATP-synthase, beta subunit, carboxyl transferase domain protein, glutamate dehydrogenase, enolase (phosphopyruvate hydratase), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase 2, tropomyosin, arginine kinase or putative chaperone protein DnaK, and galactoside-binding lectin. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD024205.
PXD022635	33806906	Persistent Inflammatory Stimulation Drives the Conversion of MSCs to Inflammatory CAFs That Promote Pro-Metastatic Characteristics in Breast Cancer Cells. 	Persistent inflammatory stimulation drives the transition of MSCs to inflammatory CAFs that promote pro-metastatic characteristics in breast cancer cells	Breast cancer, Cancer-associated fibroblasts, Inflammation, Interleukin 1beta, Mesenchymal stem cells, Tumor necrosis factor alpha.	The pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) are expressed simultaneously and have tumor-promoting roles in breast cancer. In parallel, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) undergo conversion at the tumor site to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally connected to enhanced tumor progression. Here, we determined the impact of consistent inflammatory stimulation on stromal cell plasticity. MSCs that were persistently stimulated by TNFalpha + IL-1beta (generally 14-18 days) gained a CAF-like morphology, accompanied by prominent changes in gene expression, including in stroma/fibroblast-related genes. These CAF-like cells expressed elevated levels of vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and demonstrated significantly increased abilities to contract collagen gels. Moreover, they gained the phenotype of inflammatory CAFs, as indicated by the reduced expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA), increased proliferation, and elevated expression of inflammatory genes and proteins, primarily inflammatory chemokines. These inflammatory CAFs released factors that enhanced tumor cell dispersion, scattering, and migration; the inflammatory CAF-derived factors elevated cancer cell migration by stimulating the chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR1/2 and Ras-activating receptors, expressed by the cancer cells. Together, these novel findings demonstrate that chronic inflammation can induce MSC-to-CAF conversion, leading to the generation of tumor-promoting inflammatory CAFs.
PXD024044	33808970	Characterization of Extracellular Vesicles from Preconditioned Human Adipose-Derived Stromal/Stem Cells. 	Exosome proteomics under hypoxia	exosomes, hypoxia	Cell-free therapy using extracellular vesicles (EVs) from adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (ASCs) seems to be a safe and effective therapeutic option to support tissue and organ regeneration. The application of EVs requires particles with a maximum regenerative capability and hypoxic culture conditions as an in vitro preconditioning regimen has been shown to alter the molecular composition of released EVs. Nevertheless, the EV cargo after hypoxic preconditioning has not yet been comprehensively examined. The aim of the present study was the characterization of EVs from hypoxic preconditioned ASCs. We investigated the EV proteome and their effects on renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro. While no effect of hypoxia was observed on the number of released EVs and their protein content, the cargo of the proteins was altered. Proteomic analysis showed 41 increased or decreased proteins, 11 in a statistically significant manner. Furthermore, the uptake of EVs in epithelial cells and a positive effect on oxidative stress in vitro were observed. In conclusion, culture of ASCs under hypoxic conditions was demonstrated to be a promising in vitro preconditioning regimen, which alters the protein cargo and increases the anti-oxidative potential of EVs. These properties may provide new potential therapeutic options for regenerative medicine.
PXD024276	33809102	Trastuzumab Modulates the Protein Cargo of Extracellular Vesicles Released by ERBB2(+) Breast Cancer Cells. 	Trastuzumab modulates the protein cargo of extracellular vesicles released by ERBB2+ breast cancer cells	CD63., HER2, TOP1, breast cancer, electron microscopy, extracellular vesicles, proteomic analysis, trastuzumab	Cancers overexpressing the ERBB2 oncogene are aggressive and associated with a poor prognosis. Trastuzumab is an ERBB2 specific recombinant antibody employed for the treatment of these diseases since it blocks ERBB2 signaling causing growth arrest and survival inhibition. While the effects of Trastuzumab on ERBB2 cancer cells are well known, those on the extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from these cells are scarce. This study focused on ERBB2(+) breast cancer cells and aimed to establish what type of EVs they release and whether Trastuzumab affects their morphology and molecular composition. To these aims, we performed immunoelectron microscopy, immunoblot, and high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses on EVs purified by differential centrifugation of culture supernatant. Here, we show that EVs released from ERBB2(+) breast cancer cells are polymorphic in size and appearance and that ERBB2 is preferentially associated with large (120 nm) EVs. Moreover, we report that Trastuzumab (Tz) induces the expression of a specific glycosylated 50 kDa isoform of the CD63 tetraspanin and modulates the expression of 51 EVs proteins, including TOP1. Because these proteins are functionally associated with organelle organization, cytokinesis, and response to lipids, we suggest that Tz may influence these cellular processes in target cells at distant sites via modified EVs.
PXD023080	33809909	EPS364, a Novel Deep-Sea Bacterial Exopolysaccharide, Inhibits Liver Cancer Cell Growth and Adhesion. 	A novel exopolysaccharide EPS364 from Vibrio alginolyticus inhibit cancer cell growth via blocking cell adhesion	Exopolysaccharide, FGF19-FGFR4 signaling, anti-tumor, cell adhesion	The prognosis of liver cancer was inferior among tumors. New medicine treatments are urgently needed. In this study, a novel exopolysaccharide EPS364 was purified from Vibrio alginolyticus 364, which was isolated from a deep-sea cold seep of the South China Sea. Further research showed that EPS364 consisted of mannose, glucosamine, gluconic acid, galactosamine and arabinose with a molar ratio of 5:9:3.4:0.5:0.8. The relative molecular weight of EPS364 was 14.8 kDa. Our results further revealed that EPS364 was a beta-linked and phosphorylated polysaccharide. Notably, EPS364 exhibited a significant antitumor activity, with inducing apoptosis, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Huh7.5 liver cancer cells. Proteomic and quantitative real-time PCR analyses indicated that EPS364 inhibited cancer cell growth and adhesion via targeting the FGF19-FGFR4 signaling pathway. These findings suggest that EPS364 is a promising antitumor agent for pharmacotherapy.
PXD022191	33811468	Resourcing, annotating, and analysing synthetic peptides of SARS-CoV-2 for immunopeptidomics and other immunological studies. 	Spectral library for SARS-COVID proteome and immunopeptidome	HLA, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SARS-COVID, SWATH-MS, immunopeptidomics	SARS-CoV-2 has caused a significant ongoing pandemic worldwide. A number of studies have examined the T cell mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, identifying potential T cell epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Such studies will aid in identifying targets for vaccination and immune monitoring. In this study, we applied tandem mass spectrometry and proteomic techniques to a library of ~40,000 synthetic peptides, in order to generate a large dataset of SARS-CoV-2 derived peptide MS/MS spectra. On this basis, we built an online knowledgebase, termed virusMS (https://virusms.erc.monash.edu/), to document, annotate and analyse these synthetic peptides and their spectral information. VirusMS incorporates a user-friendly interface to facilitate searching, browsing and downloading the database content. Detailed annotations of the peptides, including experimental information, peptide modifications, predicted peptide-HLA (human leukocyte antigen) binding affinities, and peptide MS/MS spectral data, are provided in virusMS.
PXD070109	33811703	Deoxyhypusine synthase, an essential enzyme for hypusine biosynthesis, is required for proper exocrine pancreas development. 	Deoxyhypusine synthase, an essential enzyme for hypusine biosynthesis, is required for proper exocrine pancreas development	DHPS, DatasetType:Proteomics, eIF5A, embryonic pancreas, exocrine, hypusine, on demand translation	Pancreatic diseases including diabetes and exocrine insufficiency would benefit from therapies that reverse cellular loss and/or restore cellular mass. The identification of molecular pathways that influence cellular growth is therefore critical for future therapeutic generation. Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) is an enzyme that post-translationally modifies and activates the mRNA translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). Previous work demonstrated that the inhibition of DHPS impairs zebrafish exocrine pancreas development; however, the link between DHPS, eIF5A, and regulation of pancreatic organogenesis remains unknown. Herein we identified that the conditional deletion of either Dhps or Eif5a in the murine pancreas results in the absence of acinar cells. Because DHPS catalyzes the activation of eIF5A, we evaluated and uncovered a defect in mRNA translation concomitant with defective production of proteins that influence cellular development. Our studies reveal a heretofore unappreciated role for DHPS and eIF5A in the synthesis of proteins required for cellular development and function.
PXD020994	33811809	BET inhibition blocks inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction and SARS-CoV-2 infection. 	Discovery of drugs to treat cytokine storm-induced cardiac dysfunction	COVID-19, Covid-19, EasyPhos, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, SARS-CoV2, cardiac organoids, cytokine storm, heart, phosphoproteomics	Cardiac injury and dysfunction occur in COVID-19 patients and increase the risk of mortality. Causes are ill defined but could be through direct cardiac infection and/or inflammation-induced dysfunction. To identify mechanisms and cardio-protective drugs, we use a state-of-the-art pipeline combining human cardiac organoids with phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing. We identify an inflammatory "cytokine-storm", a cocktail of interferon gamma, interleukin 1beta, and poly(I:C), induced diastolic dysfunction. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 is activated along with a viral response that is consistent in both human cardiac organoids (hCOs) and hearts of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. Bromodomain and extraterminal family inhibitors (BETi) recover dysfunction in hCOs and completely prevent cardiac dysfunction and death in a mouse cytokine-storm model. Additionally, BETi decreases transcription of genes in the viral response, decreases ACE2 expression, and reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes. Together, BETi, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough designated drug, apabetalone, are promising candidates to prevent COVID-19 mediated cardiac damage.
PXD024595	33811857	The adaptor protein GIPC1 stabilizes the scavenger receptor SR-B1 and increases its cholesterol uptake. 	PDZ domain-containing adaptor protein GIPC1 interacts with the SR-B1 and modulates its expression and lipid transport function	GIPC1, SR-B1, cholesterol, lipid metabolism, protein-protein interaction	The scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, is a membrane glycoprotein that mediates selective uptake of HDL-cholesterol and cholesterol ester (CE) into cells. SR-B1 is subject to posttranslational regulation; however, the underlying mechanisms still remain obscure. Here, we identified a novel SR-B1-interacting protein, GIPC1 (GAIP-interacting protein, C terminus 1) that interacts with SR-B1 and stabilizes SR-B1 by negative regulation of its proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways. The physiological interaction between SR-B1 and GIPC1 was supported by co-immunoprecipitation of wild-type and mutant GIPC1 constructs in SR-B1 +/- GIPC1 overexpressing cells, in native liver cells, and in mouse liver tissues. Overexpression of GIPC1 increased endogenous SR-B1 protein levels, subsequently increasing selective HDL-cholesterol/CE uptake and cellular triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels, whereas silencing of GIPC1 in the mouse liver was associated with blunted hepatic SR-B1 levels, elevated plasma TG and TC, and attenuated hepatic TG and TC content. A positive correlation was identified between GIPC1 and SR-B1 expression, and both expressions of GIPC1 and SR-B1 from human liver samples were inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI) from human subjects. We therefore conclude that GIPC1 plays a key role in the stability and function of SR-B1 and can also effectively regulate hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism. These findings expand our knowledge of the regulatory roles of GIPC1 and suggest that GIPC1 exerts a major effect on cell surface receptors such as SR-B1 and its associated hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolic processes.
PXD020997	33812089	Integrative Proteomic and Metabolomic Analysis Reveals Metabolic Phenotype in Mice With Cardiac-Specific Deletion of Natriuretic Peptide Receptor A. 	NPRA-deficient mice cardiac tissue LC-MS/MS	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Cardiac tissues plasma, Human Proteome Project, Mice, NPRA, ProteomeXchange project tag: Cardiovascular (B/D-HPP)	Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are important biological markers and cardiac function regulators. Natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA) binds to an ANP or BNP ligand and induces transmembrane signal transduction by elevating the intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. However, the metabolic phenotype and related mechanisms induced by NPRA deletion remain ambiguous. Here, we constructed myocardial-specific NPRA deletion mice and detected the heart functional and morphological characteristics by histological analysis and explored the altered metabolic pattern and the expression patterns of proteins by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based omics technology. NPRA deficiency unexpectedly did not result in significant cardiac remodeling or dysfunction. However, compared with the matched littermates, NPRA-deficient mice had significant metabolic differences. Metabolomic analysis showed that the metabolite levels varied in cardiac tissues and plasma. In total, 33 metabolites were identified in cardiac tissues and 54 were identified in plasma. Compared with control mice, NPRA-deficient mice had 20 upregulated and six downregulated metabolites in cardiac tissues and 25 upregulated and 23 downregulated metabolites in plasma. Together, NPRA deficiency resulted in increased nucleotide biosynthesis and histidine metabolism only in heart tissues and decreased creatine metabolism only in plasma. Further proteomic analysis identified 136 differentially abundant proteins in cardiac tissues, including 54 proteins with higher abundance and 82 proteins with lower abundance. Among them, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7c and 7b (Cox7c, Cox7b), ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial Fo complex subunit F2 (ATP5J2), ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, complex III subunit X (Uqcr10), and myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7) were mainly involved in related metabolic pathways. These results revealed the essential role of NPRA in metabolic profiles and may elucidate new underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of NPRA in cardiovascular diseases.
PXD024074	33812994	Structure-activity relationship of ipglycermide binding to phosphoglycerate mutases. 	Co-dependent macrocyclic peptide interactions facilitate ipglycermide high affinity binding to phosphoglycerate mutases	cyclic peptide, interaction, phosphoglycerate mutase, structure	Catalysis of human phosphoglycerate mutase is dependent on a 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate cofactor (dPGM), whereas the nonhomologous isozyme in many parasitic species is cofactor independent (iPGM). This mechanistic and phylogenetic diversity offers an opportunity for selective pharmacologic targeting of glycolysis in disease-causing organisms. We previously discovered ipglycermide, a potent inhibitor of iPGM, from a large combinatorial cyclic peptide library. To fully delineate the ipglycermide pharmacophore, herein we construct a detailed structure-activity relationship using 280 substituted ipglycermide analogs. Binding affinities of these analogs to immobilized Caenorhabditis elegans iPGM, measured as fold enrichment relative to the index residue by deep sequencing of an mRNA display library, illuminated the significance of each amino acid to the pharmacophore. Using cocrystal structures and binding kinetics, we show that the high affinity of ipglycermide for iPGM orthologs, from Brugia malayi, Onchocerca volvulus, Dirofilaria immitis, and Escherichia coli, is achieved by a codependence between (1) the off-rate mediated by the macrocycle Cys14 thiolate coordination to an active-site Zn(2+) in the iPGM phosphatase domain and (2) shape complementarity surrounding the macrocyclic core at the phosphotransferase-phosphatase domain interface. Our results show that the high-affinity binding of ipglycermide to iPGMs freezes these structurally dynamic enzymes into an inactive, stable complex.
PXD023860	33816490	Structural and Functional Characterization of Fibronectin in Extracellular Vesicles From Hepatocytes. 	Mouse hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicle proteome analysis	extracellular vesicles, mouse hepatocytes	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-limited nanoparticles that are liberated by cells and contain a complex molecular payload comprising proteins, microRNA, RNAs, and lipids. EVs may be taken up by other cells resulting in their phenotypic or functional reprogramming. In the liver, EVs produced by non-injured hepatocytes are involved in the maintenance of hepatic homeostasis or therapeutic outcomes following injury while EVs produced by damaged hepatocytes may drive or exacerbate liver injury. In this study, we examined the contribution of EV fibronectin (FN1) to the biogenesis, release, uptake, and action of hepatocyte-derived EVs. While FN1 is classically viewed as a component of the extracellular matrix that regulates processes such as cell adhesion, differentiation, and wound healing and can exist in cell-associated or soluble plasma forms, we report that FN1 is also a constituent of hepatocyte EVs that functions in EV uptake by target cells such as hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSC). FN1 co-purified with EVs when EVs were enriched from conditioned medium of human or mouse hepatocytes and a direct association between FN1 and hepatocyte EVs was established by immunoprecipitation and proteinase protection. FN1 ablation in mouse hepatocytes using CRISPR-Cas9 did not alter EV biogenesis but EV uptake by HSC was significantly reduced for FN1 knockout EVs (EVDeltaFN1 ) as compared to EVs from wild type hepatocytes (EV(WT)). The uptake by hepatocytes or HSC of either EV(WT) or EVDeltaFN1 required clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, cholesterol, lysosomal acidic lipase activity, and low pH, while macropinocytosis was also involved in EVDeltaFN1 uptake in HSC. Despite their differences in rate and mechanisms of uptake, EVDeltaFN1 functioned comparably to EV(WT) in ameliorating CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in mice. In conclusion, FN1 is a constituent of hepatocyte EVs that facilitates EV uptake by target cells but is dispensable for EV-mediated anti-fibrotic activity in vivo.
PXD022179	33816558	In vivo N-Terminomics Highlights Novel Functions of ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14 in Skin Collagen Matrix Building. 	TAILS on mouse skin deficient for ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14	ADAMTS, TAILS, procollagen N-proteinase, skin	A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type I motif (ADAMTS)2 and ADAMTS14 were originally known for their ability to cleave the aminopropeptides of fibrillar collagens. Previous work using N-terminomic approach (N-TAILS) in vitro led to the identification of new substrates, including some molecules involved in TGF-beta signaling. Here, N-TAILS was used to investigate the substrates of these two enzymes in vivo, by comparing the N-terminomes of the skin of wild type mice, mice deficient in ADAMTS2, in ADAMTS14 and in both ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14. This study identified 68 potential extracellular and cell surface proteins, with the majority of them being cleaved by both enzymes. These analyses comfort their role in collagen matrix organization and suggest their implication in inflammatory processes. Regarding fibrillar collagen, this study demonstrates that both ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14 are involved in the processing of the aminopropeptide of alpha1 and alpha2 type V collagen. It also revealed the existence of several cleavage sites in the Col1 domain and in the C-propeptide of type I collagens. In addition to collagens and other extracellular proteins, two major components of the cell cytoskeleton, actin and vimentin, were also identified as potential substrates. The latter data were confirmed in vitro using purified enzymes and could potentially indicate other functions for ADAMTS2 and 14. This original investigation of mouse skin degradomes by N-terminomic highlights the essential role of ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14 in collagen matrix synthesis and turnover, and gives clues to better understand their functions in skin pathophysiology. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022179.
PXD008983	33817627	Protein interactome of the Cancerous Inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) in Th17 cells. 	CIP2A interactome in human Th17 Cells	CIP2A, Cord blood, Th17 cells, interactome	Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is involved in immune response, cancer progression, and Alzheimer's disease. However, an understanding of the mechanistic basis of its function in this wide spectrum of physiological and pathological processes is limited due to its poorly characterized interaction networks. Here we present the first systematic characterization of the CIP2A interactome by affinity-purification mass spectrometry combined with validation by selected reaction monitoring targeted mass spectrometry (SRM-MS) analysis in T helper (Th) 17 (Th17) cells. In addition to the known regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the catalytic subunits of protein PP2A were found to be interacting with CIP2A. Furthermore, the regulatory (PPP1R18, and PPP1R12A) and catalytic (PPP1CA) subunits of phosphatase PP1 were identified among the top novel CIP2A interactors. Evaluation of the ontologies associated with the proteins in this interactome revealed that they were linked with RNA metabolic processing and splicing, protein traffic, cytoskeleton regulation and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation processes. Taken together, this network of protein-protein interactions will be important for understanding and further exploring the biological processes and mechanisms regulated by CIP2A both in physiological and pathological conditions.
PXD016097	33818510	Identification of potential candidate proteins for reprogramming spinal cord-derived astrocytes into neurons: a proteomic analysis. 	Discovery of potential candidate proteins reprogramming spinal cord derived astrocytes into neurons by proteomic analysis	astrocytes, label-free proteomic analysis, neurons, reprogramming, spinal cord injury	Our previous study has confirmed that astrocytes overexpressing neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NEUROD1) in the spinal cord can be reprogrammed into neurons under in vivo conditions. However, whether they can also be reprogrammed into neurons under in vitro conditions remains unclear, and the mechanisms of programmed conversion from astrocytes to neurons have not yet been clarified. In the present study, we prepared reactive astrocytes from newborn rat spinal cord astrocytes using the scratch method and infected them with lentivirus carrying NEUROD1. The results showed that NEUROD1 overexpression reprogrammed the cultured reactive astrocytes into neurons in vitro with an efficiency of 13.4%. Using proteomic and bioinformatic analyses, 1952 proteins were identified, of which 92 were differentially expressed. Among these proteins, 11 were identified as candidate proteins in the process of reprogramming based on their biological functions and fold-changes in the bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, western blot assay revealed that casein kinase II subunit alpha (CSNK2A2) and pinin (PNN) expression in NEUROD1-overexpressing reactive astrocytes was significantly increased, suggesting that NEUROD1 can directly reprogram spinal cord-derived reactive astrocytes into neurons in vitro, and that the NEUROD1-CSNK2A2-PNN pathway is involved in this process. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Fujian Medical University, China (approval No. 2016-05) on April 18, 2016.
PXD023665	33819647	Feasibility of Phosphoproteomics on Leftover Samples After RNA Extraction With Guanidinium Thiocyanate. 	Feasibility of phosphoproteomics on left-over sample after RNA extraction (RNA-Bee)	RNAB, cell line, lysis, phenol guanidine thiocyanate, phosphoproteomics, tissue	In daily practice, different types of biomolecules are usually extracted for large-scale "omics" analysis with tailored protocols. However, when sample material is limited, an all-in-one strategy is preferable. Although lysis of cells and tissues with urea is widely used for phosphoproteomic applications, DNA, RNA, and proteins can be simultaneously extracted from small samples using acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (AGPC). Use of AGPC for mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics was reported but has not yet been thoroughly evaluated against a classical phosphoproteomic protocol. Here we compared urea- with AGPC-based protein extraction, profiling phosphorylations in the DNA damage response pathway after ionizing irradiation of U2OS cells as proof of principle. On average we identified circa 9000 phosphosites per sample with both extraction methods. Moreover, we observed high similarity of phosphosite characteristics (e.g., 94% shared class 1 identifications) and deduced kinase activities (e.g., ATM, ATR, CHEK1/2, PRKDC). We furthermore extended our comparison to murine and human tissue samples yielding similar and highly correlated results for both extraction protocols. AGPC-based sample extraction can thus replace common cell lysates for phosphoproteomic workflows and may thus be an attractive way to obtain input material for multiple omics workflows, yielding several data types from a single sample.
PXD024904	33821792	Cerebrospinal fluid proteome maps detect pathogen-specific host response patterns in meningitis. 	Cerebrospinal fluid proteome maps detect pathogen-specific host response patterns in meningitis	Bacteria, assay library	Meningitis is a potentially life-threatening infection characterized by the inflammation of the leptomeningeal membranes. Many different viral and bacterial pathogens can cause meningitis, with differences in mortality rates, risk of developing neurological sequelae, and treatment options. Here, we constructed a compendium of digital cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome maps to define pathogen-specific host response patterns in meningitis. The results revealed a drastic and pathogen-type specific influx of tissue-, cell-, and plasma proteins in the CSF, where, in particular, a large increase of neutrophil-derived proteins in the CSF correlated with acute bacterial meningitis. Additionally, both acute bacterial and viral meningitis result in marked reduction of brain-enriched proteins. Generation of a multiprotein LASSO regression model resulted in an 18-protein panel of cell- and tissue-associated proteins capable of classifying acute bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis. The same protein panel also enabled classification of tick-borne encephalitis, a subgroup of viral meningitis, with high sensitivity and specificity. The work provides insights into pathogen-specific host response patterns in CSF from different disease etiologies to support future classification of pathogen type based on host response patterns in meningitis.
PXD022214	33822017	Potential Role of Epithelial Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Anterior Gradient Protein 2 Homologue in Crohn's Disease Fibrosis. 	Fibrosis associated changes detected in the proteome of surface epithelium overlying Crohn's Disease Strictures	Inflammatory bowel disease, fibrostenosis, ileum, label free proteomics, surface epithelium	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intestinal fibrosis is a common complication of Crohn's disease [CD]. It is characterised by an accumulation of fibroblasts differentiating into myofibroblasts secreting excessive extracellular matrix. The potential role of the intestinal epithelium in this fibrotic process remains poorly defined. METHODS: We performed a pilot proteomic study comparing the proteome of surface epithelium, isolated by laser-capture microdissection, in normal and fibrotic zones of resected ileal CD strictures [13 zones collected in five patients]. Proteins of interests were validated by immunohistochemistry [IHC] in ileal and colonic samples of stricturing CD [n = 44], pure inflammatory CD [n = 29], and control [n = 40] subjects. The pro-fibrotic role of one selected epithelial protein was investigated through in-vitro experiments using HT-29 epithelial cells and a CCD-18Co fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation model. RESULTS: Proteomic study revealed an endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress proteins increase in the epithelium of CD ileal fibrotic strictures, including anterior gradient protein 2 homologue [AGR2] and binding-immunoglobulin protein [BiP]. This was confirmed by IHC. In HT-29 cells, tunicamycin-induced ER stress triggered AGR2 intracellular expression and its secretion. Supernatant of these HT-29 cells, pre-conditioned by tunicamycin, led to a myofibroblastic differentiation when applied on CCD-18Co fibroblasts. By using recombinant protein and blocking agent for AGR2, we demonstrated that the secretion of this protein by epithelial cells can play a role in the myofibroblastic differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: The development of CD fibrotic strictures could involve epithelial ER stress and particularly the secretion of AGR2.
PXD013672	33822765	Hypoxia drives murine neutrophil protein scavenging to maintain central carbon metabolism. 	Hypoxic regulation of the inflammatory lung neutrophil proteome	Neutrophil, hypoxia, inflammation, lung	Limiting dysfunctional neutrophilic inflammation while preserving effective immunity requires a better understanding of the processes that dictate neutrophil function in the tissues. Quantitative mass-spectrometry identified how inflammatory murine neutrophils regulated expression of cell surface receptors, signal transduction networks, and metabolic machinery to shape neutrophil phenotypes in response to hypoxia. Through the tracing of labeled amino acids into metabolic enzymes, proinflammatory mediators, and granule proteins, we demonstrated that ongoing protein synthesis shapes the neutrophil proteome. To maintain energy supplies in the tissues, neutrophils consumed extracellular proteins to fuel central carbon metabolism. The physiological stresses of hypoxia and hypoglycemia, characteristic of inflamed tissues, promoted this extracellular protein scavenging with activation of the lysosomal compartment, further driving exploitation of the protein-rich inflammatory milieu. This study provides a comprehensive map of neutrophil proteomes, analysis of which has led to the identification of active catabolic and anabolic pathways that enable neutrophils to sustain synthetic and effector functions in the tissues.
PXD011353	33823297	Spectral Prediction Features as a Solution for the Search Space Size Problem in Proteogenomics. 	PROTEOFORMER 2.0: MS validation	HCT116, Jurkat, MSMS, PROTEOFORMER, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS	Proteogenomics approaches often struggle with the distinction between true and false peptide-to-spectrum matches as the database size enlarges. However, features extracted from tandem mass spectrometry intensity predictors can enhance the peptide identification rate and can provide extra confidence for peptide-to-spectrum matching in a proteogenomics context. To that end, features from the spectral intensity pattern predictors MS(2)PIP and Prosit were combined with the canonical scores from MaxQuant in the Percolator postprocessing tool for protein sequence databases constructed out of ribosome profiling and nanopore RNA-Seq analyses. The presented results provide evidence that this approach enhances both the identification rate as well as the validation stringency in a proteogenomic setting.
PXD021211	33827808	Structure of TFIIK for phosphorylation of CTD of RNA polymerase II. 	Structure of TFIIK for phosphorylation of CTD of RNA polymerase II	TFIIK, phosphorylation, transcription	During transcription initiation, the general transcription factor TFIIH marks RNA polymerase II by phosphorylating Ser5 of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1, which is followed by extensive modifications coupled to transcription elongation, mRNA processing, and histone dynamics. We have determined a 3.5-Aa resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the TFIIH kinase module (TFIIK in yeast), which is composed of Kin28, Ccl1, and Tfb3, yeast homologs of CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1, respectively. The carboxyl-terminal region of Tfb3 was lying at the edge of catalytic cleft of Kin28, where a conserved Tfb3 helix served to stabilize the activation loop in its active conformation. By combining the structure of TFIIK with the previous cryo-EM structure of the preinitiation complex, we extend the previously proposed model of the CTD path to the active site of TFIIK.
PXD020194	33828141	Proteomic comparison between different tissue preservation methods for identification of promising biomarkers of urothelial bladder cancer. 	Mass spectrometry-based quantification of proteins in tumor samples from tissue preserved by different methods - a source of markers of urothelial bladder cancer	FFPE, Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, OCT, Optimal cutting temperature embedded, biobank tissue samples, urinary bladder cancer.	Samples in biobanks are generally preserved by formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding (FFPE) and/or optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT)-embedding and subsequently frozen. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of these samples is now available via developed protocols, however, the differences in results with respect to preservation methods needs further investigation. Here we use bladder urothelial carcinoma tissue of two different tumor stages (Ta/T1-non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), and T2/T3-muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)) which, upon sampling, were divided and preserved by FFPE and OCT. Samples were parallel processed from the two methods and proteins were analyzed with label-free quantitative MS. Over 700 and 1200 proteins were quantified in FFPE and OCT samples, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicates that the preservation method is the main source of variation, but also tumors of different stages could be differentiated. Proteins involved in mitochondrial function were overrepresented in OCT data but missing in the FFPE data, indicating that these proteins are not well preserved by FFPE. Concordant results for proteins such as HMGCS2 (uniquely quantified in Ta/T1 tumors), and LGALS1, ANXA5 and plastin (upregulated in T2/T3 tumors) were observed in both FFPE and OCT data, which supports the use of MS technology for biobank samples and encourages the further evaluation of these proteins as biomarkers.
PXD022768	33828143	An EAV-HP insertion in the promoter region of SLCO1B3 has pleiotropic effects on chicken liver metabolism based on the transcriptome and proteome analysis. 	Chicken liver TMT-based proteomics	chicken, liver	Solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B3 (SLCO1B3) is an important liver primarily highly expressed gene, its encoded protein (OATP1B3) involved in the transport of multi-specific endogenous and exogenous substances. We previously reported that an EAV-HP inserted mutation (IM+) in the 5' flanking region of SLCO1B3 was the causative mutation of chicken blue eggs, and a further research showed that IM+ significantly reduced the expression of SLCO1B3 in liver. Herein, we confirmed a cholate response element (IR-1) played an important role in activating SLCO1B3 and in vitro experiments showed that the activation of IR-1 can be significantly reduced by the EAV-HP IM+ . We performed transcriptome and proteomic analysis using the same set of IM+ and IM- liver tissues from Yimeng hens (a Chinese indigenous breed) to study the effect of SLCO1B3 and OATP1B3 expression reduction on chicken liver function. The results showed that common differential expression pathways were screened out from both transcriptome and proteome, in which fatty acid metabolism and drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 were significantly enriched in the KEGG analysis. The lipid-related metabolism was weakened in IM+ group, which was validated by serum biochemical assay. We unexpectedly found that EAV-HP fragment was highly expressed in the liver of the IM+ chickens. We cloned the EAV-HP full-length transcript and obtained the complete open reading frame. It is worth noting that there was some immune related differential expressed genes, such as NFKBIZ, NFKBIA, and IL1RL1, which were higher expressed in the IM+ group, which may due to the high expression of EAV-HP. Our study showed that EAV-HP IM+ reduced the expression of SLCO1B3 in liver, resulting in the decrease of fatty metabolism and exogenous substance transport capacity. The mutation itself also expressed in the liver and may be involved in the immune process. The mechanism needs further study.
PXD024237	33830607	Identification of novel inner membrane complex and apical annuli proteins of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. 	BioID with P. falciparum protein PhiL1	PhiL1, Plasmodium falciparum	The inner membrane complex (IMC) is a defining feature of apicomplexan parasites, which confers stability and shape to the cell, functions as a scaffolding compartment during the formation of daughter cells and plays an important role in motility and invasion during different life cycle stages of these single-celled organisms. To explore the IMC proteome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum we applied a proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID)-based proteomics approach, using the established IMC marker protein Photosensitized INA-Labelled protein 1 (PhIL1) as bait in asexual blood-stage parasites. Subsequent mass spectrometry-based peptide identification revealed enrichment of 12 known IMC proteins and several uncharacterized candidate proteins. We validated nine of these previously uncharacterized proteins by endogenous GFP-tagging. Six of these represent new IMC proteins, while three proteins have a distinct apical localization that most likely represents structures described as apical annuli in Toxoplasma gondii. Additionally, various Kelch13 interacting candidates were identified, suggesting an association of the Kelch13 compartment and the IMC in schizont and merozoite stages. This work extends the number of validated IMC proteins in the malaria parasite and reveals for the first time the existence of apical annuli proteins in P. falciparum. Additionally, it provides evidence for a spatial association between the Kelch13 compartment and the IMC in late blood-stage parasites.
PXD024744	33831597	Proteomic analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans wound model reveals novel molecular players involved in repair. 	Proteomic analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans wound model reveals novel molecular players involved in repair	C.elegans, Injury, LCMS/MS, Whole body	Wound repair is a multistep process which involves coordination of multiple molecular players from different cell types and pathways. Though the cellular processes that are taking place in order to repair damage is already known, molecular players involved in crucial pathways are still scarce. In this regard, the present study intends to uncover crucial players that are involved in the central repair events through proteomics approach which included 2-D GE and LC-MS/MS using Caenorhabditis elegans wound model. Initial gel-based 2-D GE and following protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses revealed active role of calcium signaling, acetylcholine transport and serotonergic neurotransmitter pathways. Further, gel-free LC-MS/MS and following PPI network analyses revealed the incidence of actin nucleation at the initial hours immediately after injury. Further by visualizing the PPI network and the interacting players, pink-1, a mitochondrial Serine/threonine-protein kinase which is known to regulate mitochondrial dynamics, was found to be the central player in facilitating the mitochondrial fission and its role was further verified using qPCR analysis and pink-1 transgenic worms. Overall, the study delivers new insights from crucial regulatory pathways and central players involved in wound repair using high throughput proteomic approaches and the mass spectrometry Data (PXD024629/PXD024744) are available via ProteomeXchange. SIGNIFICANCE.
PXD024380	33831670	Aging-induced isoDGR-modified fibronectin activates monocytic and endothelial cells to promote atherosclerosis. 	Aging-induced isoDGR-modified fibronectin activates monocytic and endothelial cells to promote atherosclerosis	Atherosclerosis, deamidation, fibronectin, integrin, isoDGR motif, vascular inflammation	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Aging is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanisms underlying age-linked atherosclerosis remain unclear. We previously observed that long-lived vascular matrix proteins can acquire 'gain-of-function' isoDGR motifs that might play a role in atherosclerotic pathology. METHODS: IsoDGR-specific mAb were generated and used for ELISA-based measurement of motif levels in plasma samples from patients with coronary artery diseases (CAD) and non-CAD controls. Functional consequences of isoDGR accumulation in age-damaged fibronectin were determined by bioassay for capacity to activate monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells (signalling activity, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and recruitment/adhesion potential). Mice deficient in the isoDGR repair enzyme PCMT1 were used to assess motif distribution and macrophage localisation in vivo. RESULTS: IsoDGR-modified fibronectin and fibrinogen levels in patient plasma were significantly enhanced in CAD and further associated with smoking status. Functional assays demonstrated that isoDGR-modified fibronectin activated both monocytes and macrophages via integrin receptor 'outside in' signalling, triggering an ERK:AP-1 cascade and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP-1 and TNFalpha to drive additional recruitment of circulating leukocytes. IsoDGR-modified fibronectin also induced endothelial cell expression of integrin beta1 to further enhance cellular adhesion and matrix deposition. Analysis of murine aortic tissues confirmed accumulation of isoDGR-modified proteins co-localised with CD68(+) macrophages in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Age-damaged fibronectin features isoDGR motifs that increase binding to integrins on the surface of monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Subsequent activation of 'outside-in' signalling elicits a range of potent cytokines and chemokines that drive additional leukocyte recruitment to the developing atherosclerotic matrix.
PXD015566	33833033	Crucial role of fatty acid oxidation in asthmatic bronchial smooth muscle remodelling. 	The crucial role of CPT2 in the asthmatic bronchial smooth muscle remodeling	Asthma, smooth muscle cells	BACKGROUND: Bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) remodelling in asthma is related to an increased mitochondrial biogenesis and enhanced BSM cell proliferation in asthma. Since mitochondria produce the highest levels of cellular energy and fatty acid beta-oxidation is the most powerful way to produce ATP, we hypothesised that, in asthmatic BSM cells, energetic metabolism is shifted towards the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterise BSM cell metabolism in asthma both in vitro and ex vivo to identify a novel target for reducing BSM cell proliferation. METHODS: 21 asthmatic and 31 non-asthmatic patients were enrolled. We used metabolomic and proteomic approaches to study BSM cells. Oxidative stress, ATP synthesis, fatty acid endocytosis, metabolite production, metabolic capabilities, mitochondrial networks, cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed on BSM cells. Fatty acid content was assessed in vivo using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation spectrometry imaging. RESULTS: Asthmatic BSM cells were characterised by an increased rate of mitochondrial respiration with a stimulated ATP production and mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Fatty acid consumption was increased in asthmatic BSM both in vitro and ex vivo. Proteome remodelling of asthmatic BSM occurred via two canonical mitochondrial pathways. The levels of carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT)2 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, which internalise fatty acids through mitochondrial and cell membranes, respectively, were both increased in asthmatic BSM cells. Blocking CPT2 or LDL receptor drastically and specifically reduced asthmatic BSM cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a metabolic switch towards mitochondrial beta-oxidation in asthmatic BSM and identifies fatty acid metabolism as a new key target to reduce BSM remodelling in asthma.
PXD022368	33833277	Assessing the degradation of ancient milk proteins through site-specific deamidation patterns. 	Milking it? Assessing the degradation of ancient milk proteomes	authentication, deamidation, milk, palaeoproteomics	The origins, prevalence and nature of dairying have been long debated by archaeologists. Within the last decade, new advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry have allowed for the direct detection of milk proteins from archaeological remains, including ceramic residues, dental calculus, and preserved dairy products. Proteins recovered from archaeological remains are susceptible to post-excavation and laboratory contamination, a particular concern for ancient dairying studies as milk proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and caseins are potential laboratory contaminants. Here, we examine how site-specific rates of deamidation (i.e., deamidation occurring in specific positions in the protein chain) can be used to elucidate patterns of peptide degradation, and authenticate ancient milk proteins. First, we characterize site-specific deamidation patterns in modern milk products and experimental samples, confirming that deamidation occurs primarily at low half-time sites. We then compare this to previously published palaeoproteomic data from six studies reporting ancient milk peptides. We confirm that site-specific deamidation rates, on average, are more advanced in BLG  recovered from ancient dental calculus and pottery residues. Nevertheless, deamidation rates displayed a high degree of variability, making it challenging to authenticate samples with relatively few milk peptides. We demonstrate that site-specific deamidation is a useful tool for identifying modern contamination but highlight the need for multiple lines of evidence to authenticate ancient protein data.
PXD013696	33833385	Temporal multiomic modeling reveals a B-cell receptor proliferative program in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 	A core proliferative program induced by B-cell receptor stimulation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells	CLL, transcriptomic	B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is crucial for the pathophysiology of most mature B-cell lymphomas/leukemias and has emerged as a therapeutic target whose effectiveness remains limited by the occurrence of mutations. Therefore, deciphering the cellular program activated downstream this pathway has become of paramount importance for the development of innovative therapies. Using an original ex vivo model of BCR-induced proliferation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, we generated 108 temporal transcriptional and proteomic profiles from 1 h up to 4 days after BCR activation. This dataset revealed a structured temporal response composed of 13,065 transcripts and 4027 proteins, comprising a leukemic proliferative signature consisting of 430 genes and 374 proteins. Mathematical modeling of this complex cellular response further highlighted a transcriptional network driven by 14 early genes linked to proteins involved in cell proliferation. This group includes expected genes (EGR1/2, NF-kB) and genes involved in NF-kB signaling modulation (TANK, ROHF) and immune evasion (KMO, IL4I1) that have not yet been associated with leukemic cells proliferation. Our study unveils the BCR-activated proliferative genetic program in primary leukemic cells. This approach combining temporal measurements with modeling allows identifying new putative targets for innovative therapy of lymphoid malignancies and also cancers dependent on ligand-receptor interactions.
PXD022422	33833851	Low-Dose Copper Exposure Exacerbates Depression-Like Behavior in ApoE4 Transgenic Mice. 	Low-dose Copper exposure exacerbates depression-like behavior in ApoE4 transgenic mice	ApoE4, Copper (Cu), Depression	Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the pathogenesis of depression is still unknown, environmental risk factors and genetics are implicated. Copper (Cu), a cofactor of multiple enzymes, is involved in regulating depression-related processes. Depressed patients carrying the apolipoprotein epsilon4 allele display more severe depressive symptoms, indicating that ApoE4 is closely associated with an increased risk of depression. The study explored the effect of low-dose Cu exposure and ApoE4 on depression-like behavior of mice and further investigates the possible mechanisms. The ApoE4 mice and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with 0.13 ppm CuCl2 for 4 months. After the treatment, ApoE4 mice displayed obvious depression-like behavior compared with the WT mice, and Cu exposure further exacerbated the depression-like behavior of ApoE4 mice. There was no significant difference in anxiety behavior and memory behavior. Proteomic analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins between Cu-exposed and nonexposed ApoE4 mice were mainly involved in the Ras signaling pathway, protein export, axon guidance, serotonergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, and dopaminergic synapse. Among these differentially expressed proteins, immune response and synaptic function are highly correlated. Representative protein expression changes are quantified by western blot, showing consistent results as determined by proteomic analysis. Hippocampal astrocytes and microglia were increased in Cu-exposed ApoE4 mice, suggesting that neuroglial cells played an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. Taken together, our study demonstrated that Cu exposure exacerbates depression-like behavior of ApoE4 mice and the mechanisms may involve the dysregulation of synaptic function and immune response and overactivation of neuroinflammation.
PXD019126	33833982	Tumor Microenvironment Proteomics: Lessons From Multiple Myeloma. 	Multiple myeloma microenvironment proteomics LC-MS/MS	Multiple myeloma, tumor microenvironment	Although the "seed and soil" hypothesis was proposed by Stephen Paget at the end of the 19th century, where he postulated that tumor cells (seeds) need a propitious medium (soil) to be able to establish metastases, only recently the tumor microenvironment started to be more studied in the field of Oncology. Multiple myeloma (MM), a malignancy of plasma cells, can be considered one of the types of cancers where there is more evidence in the literature of the central role that the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment plays, contributing to proliferation, survival, migration, and drug resistance of tumor cells. Despite all advances in the therapeutic arsenal for MM treatment in the last years, the disease remains incurable. Thus, studies aiming a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, as well as searching for new therapeutic targets are necessary and welcome. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the protein expression profiling of mononuclear cells derived from BM of MM patients in comparison with these same cell types derived from healthy individuals, in order to fill this gap in MM treatment. Proteomic analysis was performed using the mass spectrometry technique and further analyses were done using bioinformatics tools, to identify dysregulated biological pathways and/or processes in the BM microenvironment of patients with MM as a result of the disease. Among the pathways identified in this study, we can highlight an upregulation of proteins related to protein biosynthesis, especially chaperone proteins, in patients with MM. Additionally, we also found an upregulation of several proteins involved in energy metabolism, which is one of the cancer hallmarks. Finally, with regard to the downregulated proteins, we can highlight mainly those involved in different pathways of the immune response, corroborating the data that has demonstrated that the immune system of MM is impaired and, therefore, the immunotherapies that have been studied recently for the treatment of the disease are extremely necessary in the search for a control and a cure for these patients who live with the disease.
PXD017006	33834258	TSC-insensitive Rheb mutations induce oncogenic transformation through a combination of constitutively active mTORC1 signalling and proteome remodelling. 	TSC-Insensitive Rheb Mutations Induce Oncogenic Transformation Through a Combination of Hyperactive mTORC1 Signalling and Metabolic Reprogramming	Rheb, mTOR, proteomes	The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is an important regulator of cellular metabolism that is commonly hyperactivated in cancer. Recent cancer genome screens have identified multiple mutations in Ras-homolog enriched in brain (Rheb), the primary activator of mTORC1 that might act as driver oncogenes by causing hyperactivation of mTORC1. Here, we show that a number of recurrently occurring Rheb mutants drive hyperactive mTORC1 signalling through differing levels of insensitivity to the primary inactivator of Rheb, tuberous sclerosis complex. We show that two activated mutants, Rheb-T23M and E40K, strongly drive increased cell growth, proliferation and anchorage-independent growth resulting in enhanced tumour growth in vivo. Proteomic analysis of cells expressing the mutations revealed, surprisingly, that these two mutants promote distinct oncogenic pathways with Rheb-T23M driving an increased rate of anaerobic glycolysis, while Rheb-E40K regulates the translation factor eEF2 and autophagy, likely through differential interactions with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which modulate its activity. Our findings suggest that unique, personalized, combination therapies may be utilised to treat cancers according to which Rheb mutant they harbour.
PXD024020	33838182	The multidomain architecture of a bacteriophage endolysin enables intramolecular synergism and regulation of bacterial lysis. 	Intramolecular synergism and proteolytic control of bacteriophage endolysin PlySK1249	Bacteriophage, endolysin, proteolysis	Endolysins are peptidoglycan hydrolases produced at the end of the bacteriophage (phage) replication cycle to lyse the host cell. Endolysins in Gram-positive phages come in a variety of multimodular forms that combine different catalytic and cell wall binding domains. However, the reason why phages adopt endolysins with such complex multidomain architecture is not well understood. In this study, we used the Streptococcus dysgalactiae phage endolysin PlySK1249 as a model to investigate the role of multidomain architecture in phage-induced bacterial lysis and lysis regulation. PlySK1249 consists of an amidase (Ami) domain that lyses bacterial cells, a nonbacteriolytic endopeptidase (CHAP) domain that acts as a dechaining enzyme, and a central LysM cell wall binding domain. We observed that the Ami and CHAP domains synergized for peptidoglycan digestion and bacteriolysis in the native enzyme or when expressed individually and reunified. The CHAP endopeptidase resolved complex polymers of stem-peptides to dimers and helped the Ami domain to digest peptidoglycan to completion. We also found that PlySK1249 was subject to proteolytic cleavage by host cell wall proteases both in vitro and after phage induction. Cleavage disconnected the different domains by hydrolyzing their linker regions, thus hindering their bacteriolytic cooperation and possibly modulating the lytic activity of the enzyme. PlySK1249 cleavage by cell-wall-associated proteases may represent another example of phage adaptation toward the use of existing bacterial regulation mechanism for their own advantage. In addition, understanding more thoroughly the multidomain interplay of PlySK1249 broadens our knowledge on the ideal architecture of therapeutic antibacterial endolysins.
PXD023906	33839152	HIV-1 exposure promotes PKG1-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of stathmin to increase epithelial barrier permeability. 	The interacting protein peptide sequences of stathmin	cell	Exposure of mucosal epithelial cells to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp120 is known to disrupt epithelial cell junctions by impairing stathmin-mediated microtubule depolymerization. However, the pathological significance of this process and its underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. Here we show that treatment of epithelial cells with pseudotyped HIV-1 viral particles or recombinant gp120 protein results in the activation of protein kinase G 1 (PKG1). Examination of epithelial cells by immunofluorescence microscopy reveals that PKG1 activation mediates the epithelial barrier damage upon HIV-1 exposure. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that PKG1 interacts with stathmin and phosphorylates stathmin at serine 63 in the presence of gp120. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence microscopy further demonstrate that PKG1-mediated phosphorylation of stathmin promotes its autophagic degradation by enhancing the interaction between stathmin and the autophagy adaptor protein p62. Collectively, these results suggest that HIV-1 exposure exploits the PKG1/stathmin axis to affect the microtubule cytoskeleton and thereby perturbs epithelial cell junctions. Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism by which exposure to HIV-1 increases epithelial permeability, which has implications for the development of effective strategies to prevent mucosal HIV-1 transmission.
PXD022859	33839314	Meta-omics analysis indicates the saliva microbiome and its proteins associated with the prognosis of oral cancer patients. 	Meta-omics analysis indicates the saliva microbiome and its proteins associated with the prognosis of oral cancer patients	oral cancer diagnosis and prognosis, oral microbiome, oral squamous cell carcinoma, saliva	Saliva is a biofluid that maintains the health of oral tissues and the homeostasis of oral microbiota. Studies have demonstrated that Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients have different salivary microbiota than healthy individuals. However, the relationship between these microbial differences and clinicopathological outcomes is still far from conclusive. Herein, we investigate the capability of using metagenomic and metaproteomic saliva profiles to distinguish between Control (C), OSCC without active lesion (L0), and OSCC with active lesion (L1) patients. The results show that there are significantly distinct taxonomies and functional changes in L1 patients compared to C and L0 patients, suggesting compositional modulation of the oral microbiome, as the relative abundances of Centipeda, Veillonella, and Gemella suggested by metagenomics are correlated with tumor size, clinical stage, and active lesion. Metagenomics results also demonstrated that poor overall patient survival is associated with a higher relative abundance of Stenophotromonas, Staphylococcus, Centipeda, Selenomonas, Alloscordovia, and Acitenobacter. Finally, compositional and functional differences in the saliva content by metaproteomics analysis can distinguish healthy individuals from OSCC patients. In summary, our study suggests that oral microbiota and their protein abundance have potential diagnosis and prognosis value for oral cancer patients. Further studies are necessary to understand the role of uniquely detected metaproteins in the microbiota of healthy and OSCC patients as well as the crosstalk between saliva host proteins and the oral microbiome present in OSCC.
PXD022885	33840197	Surveying the Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus) Serum Proteome: A Resource for Identifying Immunological Proteins and Detecting Pathogens. 	Surveying the vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) serum proteome: a resource for identifying immunological proteins and detecting pathogens	DIA, Vampire Bat, serum	Bats are increasingly studied as model systems for longevity and as natural hosts for some virulent viruses. Yet the ability to characterize immune mechanisms of viral tolerance and to quantify infection dynamics in wild bats is often limited by small sample volumes and few species-specific reagents. Here, we demonstrate how proteomics can overcome these limitations by using data-independent acquisition-based shotgun proteomics to survey the serum proteome of 17 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from Belize. Using just 2 muL of sample and relatively short separations of undepleted serum digests, we identified 361 proteins across 5 orders of magnitude. Levels of immunological proteins in vampire bat serum were then compared to human plasma via published databases. Of particular interest were antiviral and antibacterial components, circulating 20S proteasome complex and proteins involved in redox activity. Lastly, we used known virus proteomes to putatively identify Rh186 from Macacine herpesvirus 3 and ORF1a from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, indicating that mass spectrometry-based techniques show promise for pathogen detection. Overall, these results can be used to design targeted mass-spectrometry assays to quantify immunological markers and detect pathogens. More broadly, our findings also highlight the application of proteomics in advancing wildlife immunology and pathogen surveillance.
PXD021819	33842315	Discovery and Pharmacological Evaluation of STEAP4 as a Novel Target for HER2 Overexpressing Breast Cancer. 	Discovery and pharmacological evaluation of STEAP4 as a novel target for HER2 overexpressing Breast cancer	Breast Cacner, HER2, STEAP4, orbitrap, therapeutic targets	Breast cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease encompassing multiple subtypes with different molecular and histopathological features, disease prognosis, and therapeutic responses. Among these, the Triple Negative BC form (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with poor prognosis and therapeutic outcome. With respect to HER2 overexpressing BC, although advanced targeted therapies have improved the survival of patients, disease relapse and metastasis remains a challenge for therapeutic efficacy. In this study the aim was to identify key membrane-associated proteins which are overexpressed in these aggressive BC subtypes and can serve as potential biomarkers or drug targets. We leveraged on the development of a membrane enrichment protocol in combination with the global profiling GeLC-MS/MS technique, and compared the proteomic profiles of a HER2 overexpressing (HCC-1954) and a TNBC (MDA-MB-231) cell line with that of a benign control breast cell line (MCF-10A). An average of 2300 proteins were identified from each cell line, of which approximately 600 were membrane-associated proteins. Our global proteomic methodology in tandem with invigoration by Western blot and Immunofluorescence analysis, readily detected several previously-established BC receptors like HER2 and EPHA2, but importantly STEAP4 and CD97 emerged as novel potential candidate markers. This is the first time that the mitochondrial iron reductase STEAP4 protein up-regulation is linked to BC (HER2+ subtype), while for CD97, its role in BC has been previously described, but never before by a global proteomic technology in TNBC. STEAP4 was selected for further detailed evaluation by the employment of Immunohistochemical analysis of BC xenografts and clinical tissue microarray studies. Results showed that STEAP4 expression was evident only in malignant breast tissues whereas all the benign breast cases had no detectable levels. A functional role of STEAP4 intervention was established in HER2 overexpressing BC by pharmacological studies, where blockage of the STEAP4 pathway with an iron chelator (Deferiprone) in combination with the HER2 inhibitor Lapatinib led to a significant reduction in cell growth in vitro. Furthermore, siRNA mediated knockdown of STEAP4 also suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced the inhibition of Lapatinib in HER2 overexpressing BC, confirming its potential oncogenic role in BC. In conclusion, STEAP4 may represent a novel BC related biomarker and a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of HER2 overexpressing BC.
PXD023280	33842387	Sickle Cell Trait Modulates the Proteome and Phosphoproteome of Plasmodium falciparum-Infected Erythrocytes. 	Sickle cell trait modulates the proteome and phosphoproteome of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocyte	Plasmodium falciparum, erythrocyte, hemoglobin S, membrane phosphorylation, proteomics.	The high prevalence of sickle cell disease in some human populations likely results from the protection afforded against severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria and death by heterozygous carriage of HbS. P. falciparum remodels the erythrocyte membrane and skeleton, displaying parasite proteins at the erythrocyte surface that interact with key human proteins in the Ankyrin R and 4.1R complexes. Oxidative stress generated by HbS, as well as by parasite invasion, disrupts the kinase/phosphatase balance, potentially interfering with the molecular interactions between human and parasite proteins. HbS is known to be associated with abnormal membrane display of parasite antigens. Studying the proteome and the phosphoproteome of red cell membrane extracts from P. falciparum infected and non-infected erythrocytes, we show here that HbS heterozygous carriage, combined with infection, modulates the phosphorylation of erythrocyte membrane transporters and skeletal proteins as well as of parasite proteins. Our results highlight modifications of Ser-/Thr- and/or Tyr- phosphorylation in key human proteins, such as ankyrin, beta-adducin, beta-spectrin and Band 3, and key parasite proteins, such as RESA or MESA. Altered phosphorylation patterns could disturb the interactions within membrane protein complexes, affect nutrient uptake and the infected erythrocyte cytoadherence phenomenon, thus lessening the severity of malaria symptoms.
PXD018314	33843278	Proteome analysis of human adipocytes identifies depot-specific heterogeneity at metabolic control points. 	Proteome analysis of human visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes identifies altered metabolic control points	SWATHßMS, adipose tissue, lipid metabolism, obesity	Adipose tissue is a primary regulator of energy balance and metabolism. The distribution of adipose tissue depots is of clinical interest because the accumulation of upper-body subcutaneous (ASAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with cardiometabolic diseases, whereas lower-body glutealfemoral adipose tissue (GFAT) appears to be protective. There is heterogeneity in morphology and metabolism of adipocytes obtained from different regions of the body, but detailed knowledge of the constituent proteins in each depot is lacking. Here, we determined the human adipocyte proteome from ASAT, VAT, and GFAT using high-resolution Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical (SWATH) mass spectrometry proteomics. We quantified 4,220 proteins in adipocytes, and 2,329 proteins were expressed in all three adipose depots. Comparative analysis revealed significant differences between adipocytes from different regions (6% and 8% when comparing VAT vs. ASAT and GFAT, 3% when comparing the subcutaneous adipose tissue depots, ASAT and GFAT), with marked differences in proteins that regulate metabolic functions. The VAT adipocyte proteome was overrepresented with proteins of glycolysis, lipogenesis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The GFAT adipocyte proteome predicted the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), fatty acid, and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) oxidation, enhanced tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux, and oxidative phosphorylation, which was supported by metabolomic data obtained from adipocytes. Together, this proteomic analysis provides an important resource and novel insights that enhance the understanding of metabolic heterogeneity in the regional adipocytes of humans.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Adipocyte metabolism varies depending on anatomical location and the adipocyte protein composition may orchestrate this heterogeneity. We used SWATH proteomics in patient-matched human upper- (visceral and subcutaneous) and lower-body (glutealfemoral) adipocytes and detected 4,220 proteins and distinguishable regional proteomes. Upper-body adipocyte proteins were associated with glycolysis, de novo lipogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, whereas lower-body adipocyte proteins were associated with enhanced PPARalpha activation, fatty acid, and BCAA oxidation, TCA cycle flux, and oxidative phosphorylation.
PXD023423	33844560	Molecular Profiling Associated with Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase 2 (CAMKK2)-Mediated Carcinogenesis in Gastric Cancer. 	Mining gastric cancer cellular quantitative proteomics data to analyse the proteome change upon CAMKK2 inhibition	CAMKK2, Data Mining, Gastric cancer, STO-609	Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. We showed previously that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2), a serine-threonine kinase, is highly expressed in gastric cancer and leads to progression. In the present study, we identified the molecular networks involved in CAMKK2-mediated progression of gastric adenocarcinoma. Treatment of gastric cancer cell lines with a CAMKK2 inhibitor, STO-609, resulted in decreased cell migration, invasion, and colony-forming ability and a G1/S-phase arrest. In addition, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis resulted in the identification of 7609 proteins, of which 219 proteins were found to be overexpressed and 718 downregulated (1.5-fold). Our data identified several key downregulated proteins involved in cell division and cell proliferation, which included DNA replication licensing factors, replication factor C, origin recognition complex, replication protein A and GINS, and mesenchymal markers, upon CAMKK2 inhibition. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence results showed concordance with our mass spectroscopy data. Taken together, our study supports CAMKK2 as a novel therapeutic target in gastric cancer.
PXD022950	33845167	Sensitive Immunopeptidomics by Leveraging Available Large-Scale Multi-HLA Spectral Libraries, Data-Independent Acquisition, and MS/MS Prediction. 	Improved sensitivity of immunopeptidomics by leveraging available large-scale pan-HLA spectral libraries and data-independent acquisition	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), DIA, Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Human Immuno-Peptidome Project (HUPO-HIPP) (B/D-HPP), immunopeptidomics, pan-HLA	Mass spectrometry (MS) is the state-of-the-art methodology for capturing the breadth and depth of the immunopeptidome across human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allotypes and cell types. The majority of studies in the immunopeptidomics field are discovery driven. Hence, data-dependent tandem MS (MS/MS) acquisition (DDA) is widely used, as it generates high-quality references of peptide fingerprints. However, DDA suffers from the stochastic selection of abundant ions that impairs sensitivity and reproducibility. In contrast, in data-independent acquisition (DIA), the systematic fragmentation and acquisition of all fragment ions within given isolation m/z windows yield a comprehensive map for a given sample. However, many DIA approaches commonly require generating comprehensive DDA-based spectrum libraries, which can become impractical for studying noncanonical and personalized neoantigens. Because the amount of HLA peptides eluted from biological samples such as small tissue biopsies is typically not sufficient for acquiring both meaningful DDA data necessary for generating comprehensive spectral libraries and DIA MS measurements, the implementation of DIA in the immunopeptidomics translational research domain has remained limited. We implemented a DIA immunopeptidomics workflow and assessed its sensitivity and accuracy by matching DIA data against libraries with growing complexity-from sample-specific libraries to libraries combining 2 to 40 different immunopeptidomics samples. Analyzing DIA immunopeptidomics data against a complex multi-HLA spectral library resulted in a two-fold increase in peptide identification compared with sample-specific library and in a three-fold increase compared with DDA measurements, yet with no detrimental effect on the specificity. Furthermore, we demonstrated the implementation of DIA for sensitive personalized neoantigen discovery through the analysis of DIA data with predicted MS/MS spectra of clinically relevant HLA ligands. We conclude that a comprehensive multi-HLA library for DIA approach in combination with MS/MS prediction is highly advantageous for clinical immunopeptidomics, especially when low amounts of biological samples are available.
PXD020222	33845483	Multilevel proteomics reveals host perturbations by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. 	Affinity purification mass spectrometry analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV proteins in A549 cells	A549 cells, APMS, Covid-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2	The emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the urgent need for an in-depth understanding of molecular functions of viral proteins and their interactions with the host proteome. Several individual omics studies have extended our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology(1-10). Integration of such datasets to obtain a holistic view of virus-host interactions and to define the pathogenic properties of SARS-CoV-2 is limited by the heterogeneity of the experimental systems. Here we report a concurrent multi-omics study of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Using state-of-the-art proteomics, we profiled the interactomes of both viruses, as well as their influence on the transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome of a lung-derived human cell line. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed crosstalk between the perturbations taking place upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at different levels and enabled identification of distinct and common molecular mechanisms of these closely related coronaviruses. The TGF-beta pathway, known for its involvement in tissue fibrosis, was specifically dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and autophagy was specifically dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 ORF3. The extensive dataset (available at https://covinet.innatelab.org ) highlights many hotspots that could be targeted by existing drugs and may be used to guide rational design of virus- and host-directed therapies, which we exemplify by identifying inhibitors of kinases and matrix metalloproteases with potent antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.
PXD024138	33845758	Proteomic response of Escherichia coli to a membrane lytic and iron chelating truncated Amaranthus tricolor defensin. 	Proteomic response of Escherichia coli to membrane lytic and iron chelating Amaranthus tricolor defensin	Amaranthus tricolor, Escherichia coli, defensins, iron chelation, iron reduction, membrane lysis	BACKGROUND: Plant defensins are a broadly distributed family of antimicrobial peptides which have been primarily studied for agriculturally relevant antifungal activity. Recent studies have probed defensins against Gram-negative bacteria revealing evidence for multiple mechanisms of action including membrane lysis and ribosomal inhibition. Herein, a truncated synthetic analog containing the gamma-core motif of Amaranthus tricolor DEF2 (Atr-DEF2) reveals Gram-negative antibacterial activity and its mechanism of action is probed via proteomics, outer membrane permeability studies, and iron reduction/chelation assays. RESULTS: Atr-DEF2(G39-C54) demonstrated activity against two Gram-negative human bacterial pathogens, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Quantitative proteomics revealed changes in the E. coli proteome in response to treatment of sub-lethal concentrations of the truncated defensin, including bacterial outer membrane (OM) and iron acquisition/processing related proteins. Modification of OM charge is a common response of Gram-negative bacteria to membrane lytic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to reduce electrostatic interactions, and this mechanism of action was confirmed for Atr-DEF2(G39-C54) via an N-phenylnaphthalen-1-amine uptake assay. Additionally, in vitro assays confirmed the capacity of Atr-DEF2(G39-C54) to reduce Fe(3+) and chelate Fe(2+) at cell culture relevant concentrations, thus limiting the availability of essential enzymatic cofactors. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the utility of plant defensin gamma-core motif synthetic analogs for characterization of novel defensin activity. Proteomic changes in E. coli after treatment with Atr-DEF2(G39-C54) supported the hypothesis that membrane lysis is an important component of gamma-core motif mediated antibacterial activity but also emphasized that other properties, such as metal sequestration, may contribute to a multifaceted mechanism of action.
PXD024171	33846300	Impaired AGO2/miR-185-3p/NRP1 axis promotes colorectal cancer metastasis. 	Impaired AGO2/miR-185-3p/NRP1 Axis Promotes Colorectal Cancer Metastasis	AGO2, colorectal cancer, metastasis	Increasing evidence suggests that global downregulation of miRNA expression is a hallmark of human cancer, potentially due to defects in the miRNA processing machinery. In this study, we found that the protein expression of Argonaute 2 (AGO2), a key regulator of miRNA processing, was downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, which was also consistent with the findings of the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). Furthermore, the correlation between the levels of AGO2 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin and vimentin) indicated that reduced levels of AGO2 promoted EMT in CRC. Low expression of AGO2 was an indicator of a poor prognosis among CRC patients. Knockdown of AGO2 in CRC cells promoted migration, invasion and metastasis formation in vitro and in vivo but had no influence on proliferation. To provide detailed insight into the regulatory roles of AGO2, we performed integrated transcriptomic, quantitative proteomic and microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) analyses of AGO2 knockdown cells and the corresponding wild-type cells and identified neuropilin 1 (NRP1) as a new substrate of AGO2 via miR-185-3p. Our data provided evidence that knockdown of AGO2 resulted in a reduction of miR-185-3p expression, leading to the upregulation of the expression of NRP1, which is a direct target of miR-185-3p, and elevated CRC cell metastatic capacity. Inhibition of NRP1 or treatment with a miR-185-3p mimic successfully rescued the phenotypes of impaired AGO2, which suggested that therapeutically targeting the AGO2/miR-185-3p/NRP1 axis may be a potential treatment approach for CRC.
PXD020451	33846315	Protein kinase A controls the hexosamine pathway by tuning the feedback inhibition of GFAT-1. 	Protein kinase A controls the hexosamine pathway by tuning feedback inhibition of GFAT-1	PKA, phosphorylation	The hexosamine pathway (HP) is a key anabolic pathway whose product uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is an essential precursor for glycosylation processes in mammals. It modulates the ER stress response and HP activation extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. The highly conserved glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase 1 (GFAT-1) is the rate-limiting HP enzyme. GFAT-1 activity is modulated by UDP-GlcNAc feedback inhibition and via phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). Molecular consequences of GFAT-1 phosphorylation, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the GFAT-1 R203H substitution that elevates UDP-GlcNAc levels in C. elegans. In human GFAT-1, the R203H substitution interferes with UDP-GlcNAc inhibition and with PKA-mediated Ser205 phosphorylation. Our data indicate that phosphorylation affects the interactions of the two GFAT-1 domains to control catalytic activity. Notably, Ser205 phosphorylation has two discernible effects: it lowers baseline GFAT-1 activity and abolishes UDP-GlcNAc feedback inhibition. PKA controls the HP by uncoupling the metabolic feedback loop of GFAT-1.
PXD024111	33846535	Deletion of LBR N-terminal domains recapitulates Pelger-Huet anomaly phenotypes in mouse without disrupting X chromosome inactivation. 	Characterization of a novel Lbr Mutation	Lamin B receptor	Mutations in the gene encoding Lamin B receptor (LBR), a nuclear-membrane protein with sterol reductase activity, have been linked to rare human disorders. Phenotypes range from a benign blood disorder, such as Pelger-Huet anomaly (PHA), affecting the morphology and chromatin organization of white blood cells, to embryonic lethality as for Greenberg dysplasia (GRBGD). Existing PHA mouse models do not fully recapitulate the human phenotypes, hindering efforts to understand the molecular etiology of this disorder. Here we show, using CRISPR/Cas-9 gene editing technology, that a 236bp N-terminal deletion in the mouse Lbr gene, generating a protein missing the N-terminal domains of LBR, presents a superior model of human PHA. Further, we address recent reports of a link between Lbr and defects in X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and show that our mouse mutant displays minor X chromosome inactivation defects that do not lead to any overt phenotypes in vivo. We suggest that our N-terminal deletion model provides a valuable pre-clinical tool to the research community and will aid in further understanding the etiology of PHA and the diverse functions of LBR.
PXD021749	33846574	Schlafen 5 as a novel therapeutic target in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. 	Schlafen 5 as a Novel Therapeutic Target in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma	Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Schlafen 5	We provide evidence that a member of the human Schlafen (SLFN) family of proteins, SLFN5, is overexpressed in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Targeted deletion of SLFN5 results in decreased PDAC cell proliferation and suppresses PDAC tumorigenesis in in vivo PDAC models. Importantly, high expression levels of SLFN5 correlate with worse outcomes in PDAC patients, implicating SLFN5 in the pathophysiology of PDAC that leads to poor outcomes. Our studies establish novel regulatory effects of SLFN5 on cell cycle progression through binding/blocking of the transcriptional repressor E2F7, promoting transcription of key genes that stimulate S phase progression. Together, our studies suggest an essential role for SLFN5 in PDAC and support the potential for developing new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of pancreatic cancer through SLFN5 targeting.
PXD017645	33846781	Metformin impairs cisplatin resistance effects in A549 lung cancer cells through mTOR signaling and other metabolic pathways. 	Metformin impairs cisplatin effects in cell size and proliferation of A549 lung cancer cells, modulating the mTOR and other metabolic pathways.	NSCLC, SILAC, cisplatin resistance, mTOR pathway, metformin	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide and exhibits intrinsic and acquired therapeutic resistance to cisplatin (CIS). The present study investigated the role of mTOR signaling and other signaling pathways after metformin (MET) treatment in control and cisplatin-resistant A549 cells, mapping pathways and possible targets involved in CIS sensitivity. MTT, flow cytometry, clonogenic assay, western blotting, proteomic analysis using the Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) approach and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR were performed. The results revealed that CIS treatment induced mTOR signaling pathway overactivation, and the mTOR status was restored by MET. MET and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA) decreased the viability in control and resistant cells, and decreased the cell size increase induced by CIS. In control cells, MET and RAPA decreased colony formation after 72 h and decreased IC50 values, potentiating the effects of CIS. Proteomics analysis revealed important pathways regulated by MET, including transcription, RNA processing and IL-12-mediated signaling. In CIS-resistant cells, MET regulated the apoptotic process, oxidative stress and G2/M transition. Annexin 4 (ANXA4) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), involved in apoptosis and oxidative stress, respectively, were chosen to validate the SILAC analysis and may represent potential therapeutic targets for lung cancer treatment. In conclusion, the chemosensitizing and antiproliferative effects of MET were associated with mTOR signaling and with potential novel targets, such as ANXA4 and SOD2, in human lung cancer cells.
PXD018246	33847835	SKI activates the Hippo pathway via LIMD1 to inhibit cardiac fibroblast activation. 	Human Cardiac Fibroblast BioID2 Interactome for SKI and TAZ(WWTR1)	BioID2, Cardiac fibroblast, Heart, Hippo, SKI, TAZ	We have previously shown that overexpression of SKI, an endogenous TGF-beta1 repressor, deactivates the pro-fibrotic myofibroblast phenotype in the heart. We now show that SKI also functions independently of SMAD/TGF-beta signaling, by activating the Hippo tumor-suppressor pathway and inhibiting the Transcriptional co-Activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ or WWTR1). The mechanism(s) by which SKI targets TAZ to inhibit cardiac fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis remain undefined. A rat model of post-myocardial infarction was used to examine the expression of TAZ during acute fibrogenesis and chronic heart failure. Results were then corroborated with primary rat cardiac fibroblast cell culture performed both on plastic and on inert elastic substrates, along with the use of siRNA and adenoviral expression vectors for active forms of SKI, YAP, and TAZ. Gene expression was examined by qPCR and luciferase assays, while protein expression was examined by immunoblotting and fluorescence microscopy. Cell phenotype was further assessed by functional assays. Finally, to elucidate SKI's effects on Hippo signaling, the SKI and TAZ interactomes were captured in human cardiac fibroblasts using BioID2 and mass spectrometry. Potential interactors were investigated in vitro to reveal novel mechanisms of action for SKI. In vitro assays on elastic substrates revealed the ability of TAZ to overcome environmental stimuli and induce the activation of hypersynthetic cardiac myofibroblasts. Further cell-based assays demonstrated that SKI causes specific proteasomal degradation of TAZ, but not YAP, and shifts actin cytoskeleton dynamics to inhibit myofibroblast activation. These findings were supported by identifying the bi-phasic expression of TAZ in vivo during post-MI remodeling and fibrosis. BioID2-based interactomics in human cardiac fibroblasts suggest that SKI interacts with actin-modifying proteins and with LIM Domain-containing protein 1 (LIMD1), a negative regulator of Hippo signaling. Furthermore, we found that LATS2 interacts with TAZ, whereas LATS1 does not, and that LATS2 knockdown prevented TAZ downregulation with SKI overexpression. Our findings indicate that SKI's capacity to regulate cardiac fibroblast activation is mediated, in part, by Hippo signaling. We postulate that the interaction between SKI and TAZ in cardiac fibroblasts is arbitrated by LIMD1, an important intermediary in focal adhesion-associated signaling pathways. This study contributes to the understanding of the unique physiology of cardiac fibroblasts, and of the relationship between SKI expression and cell phenotype.
PXD017914	33847896	Terminal alpha2,6-sialylation of epidermal growth factor receptor modulates antibody therapy response of colorectal cancer cells. 	EGFR N-Glycosylation Profile from Colorectal Cancer Cells	EGFR, N-glycosylation, ST6Gal1, colorectal cancer cell lines	BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key protein involved in cancer development. Monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR are approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite the beneficial clinical effects observed in subgroups of patients, the acquisition of resistance to treatment remains a major concern. Protein N-glycosylation of cellular receptors is known to regulate physiological processes leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways. In the present study, the role of EGFR-specific terminal alpha2,6-sialylation was analyzed in modulation of the malignant phenotype of CRC cells and their resistance to monoclonal antibody Cetuximab-based therapy. METHODS: Glycoengineered CRC cell models with specific sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 expression levels were applied to evaluate EGFR activation, cell surface glycosylation and therapeutic response to Cetuximab. RESULTS: Glycoproteomic analysis revealed EGFR as a major target of ST6Gal1-mediated alpha2,6-sialylation in a glycosite-specific manner. Mechanistically, CRC cells with increased ST6Gal1 expression and displaying terminal alpha2,6-sialylation showed a marked resistance to Cetuximab-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, we found that this resistance was accompanied by downregulation of EGFR expression and its activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that EGFR alpha2,6-sialylation is a key factor in modulating the susceptibility of CRC cells to antibody targeted therapy, thereby disclosing a potential novel biomarker and providing key molecular information for tailor made anti-cancer strategies.
PXD022527	33848465	Protein acylation by saturated very long chain fatty acids and endocytosis are involved in necroptosis. 	Quantitative proteomics characterization of proteins modified by very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) under necroptosis	IonStar proteomics acylation necroptosis	Necroptosis is a form of cell death characterized by receptor-interacting protein kinase activity and plasma membrane permeabilization via mixed-lineage kinase-like protein (MLKL). This permeabilization is responsible for the inflammatory properties of necroptosis. We previously showed that very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are functionally involved in necroptosis, potentially through protein fatty acylation. Here, we define the scope of protein acylation by saturated VLCFAs during necroptosis. We show that MLKL and phosphoMLKL, key for membrane permeabilization, are exclusively acylated during necroptosis. Reducing the levels of VLCFAs decreases their membrane recruitment, suggesting that acylation by VLCFAs contributes to their membrane localization. Acylation of phosphoMLKL occurs downstream of phosphorylation and oligomerization and appears to be, in part, mediated by ZDHHC5 (a palmitoyl transferase). We also show that disruption of endosomal trafficking increases cell viability during necroptosis, possibly by preventing recruitment, or removal, of phosphoMLKL from the plasma membrane.
PXD027979	33850044	Bacterial Microcompartments Coupled with Extracellular Electron Transfer Drive the Anaerobic Utilization of Ethanolamine in Listeria monocytogenes. 	Proteomic analysis of eut induced L. monocytogenes cells compared to eut non-induced L. monocytogenes cells to explore virulence potential and stress responses.	Caco-2 cell, Listeria monocytogenes, anaerobic growth, ethanolamine, in-vitro virulence	Ethanolamine (EA) is a valuable microbial carbon and nitrogen source derived from cell membranes. EA catabolism is suggested to occur in a cellular metabolic subsystem called a bacterial microcompartment (BMC), and the activation of EA utilization (eut) genes is linked to bacterial pathogenesis. Despite reports showing that the activation of eut is regulated by a vitamin B12-binding riboswitch and that upregulation of eut genes occurs in mice, it remains unknown whether EA catabolism is BMC dependent in Listeria monocytogenes Here, we provide evidence for BMC-dependent anaerobic EA utilization via metabolic analysis, proteomics, and electron microscopy. First, we show vitamin B12-induced activation of the eut operon in L. monocytogenes coupled to the utilization of EA, thereby enabling growth. Next, we demonstrate BMC formation connected with EA catabolism with the production of acetate and ethanol in a molar ratio of 2:1. Flux via the ATP-generating acetate branch causes an apparent redox imbalance due to the reduced regeneration of NAD(+) in the ethanol branch resulting in a surplus of NADH. We hypothesize that the redox imbalance is compensated by linking eut BMCs to anaerobic flavin-based extracellular electron transfer (EET). Using L. monocytogenes wild-type, BMC mutant, and EET mutant strains, we demonstrate an interaction between BMCs and EET and provide evidence for a role of Fe(3+) as an electron acceptor. Taken together, our results suggest an important role of BMC-dependent EA catabolism in L. monocytogenes growth in anaerobic environments like the human gastrointestinal tract, with a crucial role for the flavin-based EET system in redox balancing.IMPORTANCE Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen causing severe illness, and as such, it is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to pathogenicity. One carbon source that allows L. monocytogenes to grow in humans is ethanolamine (EA), which is derived from phospholipids present in eukaryotic cell membranes. It is hypothesized that EA utilization occurs in bacterial microcompartments (BMCs), self-assembling subcellular proteinaceous structures and analogs of eukaryotic organelles. Here, we demonstrate that BMC-driven utilization of EA in L. monocytogenes results in increased energy production essential for anaerobic growth. However, exploiting BMCs and the encapsulated metabolic pathways also requires the balancing of oxidative and reductive pathways. We now provide evidence that L. monocytogenes copes with this by linking BMC activity to flavin-based extracellular electron transfer (EET) using iron as an electron acceptor. Our results shed new light on an important molecular mechanism that enables L. monocytogenes to grow using host-derived phospholipid degradation products.
PXD020249	33850153	Lifestyle-specific S-nitrosylation of protein cysteine thiols regulates Escherichia coli biofilm formation and resistance to oxidative stress. 	Redox proteomics analysis of E.coli biofilms	E.coli, biofilm, s-nitrosylation	Communities of bacteria called biofilms are characterized by reduced diffusion, steep oxygen, and redox gradients and specific properties compared to individualized planktonic bacteria. In this study, we investigated whether signaling via nitrosylation of protein cysteine thiols (S-nitrosylation), regulating a wide range of functions in eukaryotes, could also specifically occur in biofilms and contribute to bacterial adaptation to this widespread lifestyle. We used a redox proteomic approach to compare cysteine S-nitrosylation in aerobic and anaerobic biofilm and planktonic Escherichia coli cultures and we identified proteins with biofilm-specific S-nitrosylation status. Using bacterial genetics and various phenotypic screens, we showed that impairing S-nitrosylation in proteins involved in redox homeostasis and amino acid synthesis such as OxyR, KatG, and GltD altered important biofilm properties, including motility, biofilm maturation, or resistance to oxidative stress. Our study therefore revealed that S-nitrosylation constitutes a physiological basis underlying functions critical for E. coli adaptation to the biofilm environment.
PXD022772	33852321	MS Annika: A New Cross-Linking Search Engine. 	MS Annika: A new Cross-Linking Search Engine	Proteome-Discoverer, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, XL-MS, ion-mobility, search-engine	Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has become a powerful technique that enables insights into protein structures and protein interactions. The development of cleavable cross-linkers has further promoted XL-MS through search space reduction, thereby allowing for proteome-wide studies. These new analysis possibilities foster the development of new cross-linkers, which not every search engine can deal with out of the box. In addition, some search engines for XL-MS data also struggle with the validation of identified cross-linked peptides, that is, false discovery rate (FDR) estimation, as FDR calculation is hampered by the fact that not only one but two peptides in a single spectrum have to be correct. We here present our new search engine, MS Annika, which can identify cross-linked peptides in MS2 spectra from a wide variety of cleavable cross-linkers. We show that MS Annika provides realistic estimates of FDRs without the need of arbitrary score cutoffs, being able to provide on average 44% more identifications at a similar or better true FDR than comparable tools. In addition, MS Annika can be used on proteome-wide studies due to fast, parallelized processing and provides a way to visualize the identified cross-links in protein 3D structures.
PXD023474	33852835	A membrane arm of mitochondrial complex I sufficient to promote respirasome formation. 	Proteomic analysis in the study of the mitochondrial supercomplex assembly	Co-IP, mitochondria, mitochondrial proteomics, supercomplex assembly	The assembly pathways of mitochondrial respirasome (supercomplex I+III2+IV) are not fully understood. Here, we show that an early sub-complex I assembly, rather than holo-complex I, is sufficient to initiate mitochondrial respirasome assembly. We find that a distal part of the membrane arm of complex I (PD-a module) is a scaffold for the incorporation of complexes III and IV to form a respirasome subcomplex. Depletion of PD-a, rather than other complex I modules, decreases the steady-state levels of complexes III and IV. Both HEK293T cells lacking TIMMDC1 and patient-derived cells with disease-causing mutations in TIMMDC1 showed accumulation of this respirasome subcomplex. This suggests that TIMMDC1, previously known as a complex-I assembly factor, may function as a respirasome assembly factor. Collectively, we provide a detailed, cooperative assembly model in which most complex-I subunits are added to the respirasome subcomplex in the lateral stages of respirasome assembly.
PXD022152	33852859	Functional analyses of human LUC7-like proteins involved in splicing regulation and myeloid neoplasms. 	Functional analyses of human LUC7-like proteins involved in splicing regulation and myeloid neoplasms	AML, LUC7L, LUC7L2, LUC7L3, MDS, pre-mRNA splicing, splicing	Vertebrates have evolved three paralogs, termed LUC7L, LUC7L2, and LUC7L3, of the essential yeast U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA)-associated splicing factor Luc7p. We investigated the mechanistic and regulatory functions of these putative splicing factors, of which one (LUC7L2) is mutated or deleted in myeloid neoplasms. Protein interaction data show that all three proteins bind similar core but distinct regulatory splicing factors, probably mediated through their divergent arginine-serine-rich domains, which are not present in Luc7p. Knockdown of each factor reveals mostly unique sets of significantly dysregulated alternative splicing events dependent on their binding locations, which are largely non-overlapping. Notably, knockdown of LUC7L2 alone significantly upregulates the expression of multiple spliceosomal factors and downregulates glycolysis genes, possibly contributing to disease pathogenesis. RNA binding studies reveal that LUC7L2 and LUC7L3 crosslink to weak 5' splice sites and to the 5' end of U1 snRNA, establishing an evolutionarily conserved role in 5' splice site selection.
PXD024505	33854062	Defining super-enhancer landscape in triple-negative breast cancer by multiomic profiling. 	Defining super-enhancer landscape in triple-negative breast cancer by multiomic profiling	Super-enhancer, TNBC	Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, affecting over 3.5 million women worldwide, yet the functional role of cis-regulatory elements including super-enhancers in different breast cancer subtypes remains poorly characterized. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with a poor prognosis. Here we apply integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling to uncover super-enhancer heterogeneity between breast cancer subtypes, and provide clinically relevant biological insights towards TNBC. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we identify genes that are specifically regulated by TNBC-specific super-enhancers, including FOXC1 and MET, thereby unveiling a mechanism for specific overexpression of the key oncogenes in TNBC. We also identify ANLN as a TNBC-specific gene regulated by super-enhancer. Our studies reveal a TNBC-specific epigenomic landscape, contributing to the dysregulated oncogene expression in breast tumorigenesis.
PXD022111	33854239	The AMBRA1 E3 ligase adaptor regulates the stability of cyclin D. 	The AMBRA1 E3 ligase adaptor regulates Cyclin D protein stability	orbitrap elite, ubiquitin	The initiation of cell division integrates a large number of intra- and extracellular inputs. D-type cyclins (hereafter, cyclin D) couple these inputs to the initiation of DNA replication(1). Increased levels of cyclin D promote cell division by activating cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (hereafter, CDK4/6), which in turn phosphorylate and inactivate the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor. Accordingly, increased levels and activity of cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes are strongly linked to unchecked cell proliferation and cancer(2,3). However, the mechanisms that regulate levels of cyclin D are incompletely understood(4,5). Here we show that autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1) is the main regulator of the degradation of cyclin D. We identified AMBRA1 in a genome-wide screen to investigate the genetic basis of  the response to CDK4/6 inhibition. Loss of AMBRA1 results in high levels of cyclin D in cells and in mice, which promotes proliferation and decreases sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. Mechanistically, AMBRA1 mediates ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of cyclin D as a substrate receptor for the cullin 4 E3 ligase complex. Loss of AMBRA1 enhances the growth of lung adenocarcinoma in a mouse model, and low levels of AMBRA1 correlate with worse survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Thus, AMBRA1 regulates cellular levels of cyclin D, and contributes to cancer development and the response of cancer cells to CDK4/6 inhibitors.
PXD022403	33856219	Discovery of Arginine Methylation, Phosphorylation, and Their Co-occurrence in Condensate-Associated Proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 	Discovery of arginine methylation, phosphorylation and their co-occurrence in condensate-associated proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	crosstalk, methylation, phosphorylation	The formation of condensates in membraneless organelles is thought to be driven by protein phase separation. Arginine methylation and serine/threonine phosphorylation are important in the phase separation process; however, these post-translational modifications are often present in intrinsically disordered regions that are difficult to analyze with standard proteomic techniques. To understand their presence and co-occurrence in condensate-associated proteins, here, we use a multiprotease and multi-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation approach, coupled with heavy methyl stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and phospho- or methyl-peptide enrichment. For Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we report a 50% increase in the known arginine methylproteome, involving 15 proteins that are all condensate-associated. Importantly, some of these proteins have arginine methylation on all predicted sites-providing evidence that this modification can be pervasive. We explored whether arginine-methylated, condensate-associated proteins are also phosphorylated and found 12 such proteins to carry phosphorylated serine or threonine. In Npl3, Ded1, and Sbp1, single peptides were found to carry both modifications, indicating a co-occurrence in close proximity and on the same protein molecule. These co-modifications occur in regions of disorder, whereas arginine methylation is typically on regions of disorder that are also basic. For phosphorylation, its association with charged regions of condensate-associated proteins was less consistent, although some regions with multisite phosphorylation sites were strongly acidic. We conclude that arginine-methylated proteins associated with condensates are typically also modified with protein phosphorylation.
PXD019670	33856346	Channel nuclear pore complex subunits are required for transposon silencing in Drosophila. 	Requirement of Nuclear Pore Complex Subunits for transposon silencing in Drosophila	pirna piwi npc nuclear export	The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the principal gateway between nucleus and cytoplasm that enables exchange of macromolecular cargo. Composed of multiple copies of ~30 different nucleoporins (Nups), the NPC acts as a selective portal, interacting with factors which individually license passage of specific cargo classes. Here we show that two Nups of the inner channel, Nup54 and Nup58, are essential for transposon silencing via the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway in the Drosophila ovary. In ovarian follicle cells, loss of Nup54 and Nup58 results in compromised piRNA biogenesis exclusively from the flamenco locus, whereas knockdowns of other NPC subunits have widespread consequences. This provides evidence that some Nups can acquire specialised roles in tissue-specific contexts. Our findings consolidate the idea that the NPC has functions beyond simply constituting a barrier to nuclear/cytoplasmic exchange as genomic loci subjected to strong selective pressure can exploit NPC subunits to facilitate their expression.
PXD025042	33856806	Investigation of Obesity-Alleviation Effect of Eurycoma longifolia on Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet through Metabolomics Revealed Enhanced Decomposition and Inhibition of Accumulation of Lipids. 	Investigating obesity-alleviation effect of Eurycoma longifolia on mice fed with high-fat diet through metabolomics revealed enhanced decomposition and inhibited accumulation of lipids	metabolomics approach	The metabolic and bioactivity effects of Eurycoma longifolia (Eucalyptus longifolia) in obesity treatment were studied in mice fed with a high-fat diet using a metabolomics approach. Aqueous extracts of E. longifolia were obtained via grinding, dissolving, and freeze-drying. The hepatic steatosis effect of E. longifolia was characterized by hematoxylin and eosin histological staining. External performance of the obesity-alleviation effect was monitored by measuring body and food weight. In addition, the metabolomics analysis of the E. longifolia-mice interaction system was performed using the established platform combining liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with statistical analysis. The presence and spatial distribution patterns of differential molecules were further evaluated through desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry imaging. The results showed that E. longifolia played a vital role in downregulating lipid accumulation (especially triacylglycerols) and fatty acids biosynthesis together with enhanced lipid decomposition and healing in Bagg albino mice. During such a process, E. longifolia mainly induced metabolomic alterations of amino acids, organic acids, phospholipids, and glycerolipids. Moreover, under the experimental concentrations, E. longifolia induced more fluctuations of aqueous-soluble metabolites in the plasma and lipids in the liver than in the kidneys. This study provides an advanced alternative to traditional E. longifolia-based studies for evaluating the metabolic effects and bioactivity of E. longifolia through metabolomics technology, revealing potential technological improvement and clinical application.
PXD020268	33857403	DNAJC9 integrates heat shock molecular chaperones into the histone chaperone network. 	DNAJC9 integrates heat shock molecular chaperones into the histone chaperone network	DNAJC9, HSP40, HSP70, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, chaperone, heat shock, histone chaperone	From biosynthesis to assembly into nucleosomes, histones are handed through a cascade of histone chaperones, which shield histones from non-specific interactions. Whether mechanisms exist to safeguard the histone fold during histone chaperone handover events or to release trapped intermediates is unclear. Using structure-guided and functional proteomics, we identify and characterize a histone chaperone function of DNAJC9, a heat shock co-chaperone that promotes HSP70-mediated catalysis. We elucidate the structure of DNAJC9, in a histone H3-H4 co-chaperone complex with MCM2, revealing how this dual histone and heat shock co-chaperone binds histone substrates. We show that DNAJC9 recruits HSP70-type enzymes via its J domain to fold histone H3-H4 substrates: upstream in the histone supply chain, during replication- and transcription-coupled nucleosome assembly, and to clean up spurious interactions. With its dual functionality, DNAJC9 integrates ATP-resourced protein folding into the histone supply pathway to resolve aberrant intermediates throughout the dynamic lives of histones.
PXD020186	33858848	HLA Ligand Atlas: a benign reference of HLA-presented peptides to improve T-cell-based cancer immunotherapy. 	The HLA-Ligand-Atlas. A resource of natural HLA ligands presented on benign tissues	Glioblastoma, HLA, Immunopeptidomics	BACKGROUND: The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex controls adaptive immunity by presenting defined fractions of the intracellular and extracellular protein content to immune cells. Understanding the benign HLA ligand repertoire is a prerequisite to define safe T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer. Due to the poor availability of benign tissues, if available, normal tissue adjacent to the tumor has been used as a benign surrogate when defining tumor-associated antigens. However, this comparison has proven to be insufficient and even resulted in lethal outcomes. In order to match the tumor immunopeptidome with an equivalent counterpart, we created the HLA Ligand Atlas, the first extensive collection of paired HLA-I and HLA-II immunopeptidomes from 227 benign human tissue samples. This dataset facilitates a balanced comparison between tumor and benign tissues on HLA ligand level. METHODS: Human tissue samples were obtained from 16 subjects at autopsy, five thymus samples and two ovary samples originating from living donors. HLA ligands were isolated via immunoaffinity purification and analyzed in over 1200 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry runs. Experimentally and computationally reproducible protocols were employed for data acquisition and processing. RESULTS: The initial release covers 51 HLA-I and 86 HLA-II allotypes presenting 90,428 HLA-I- and 142,625 HLA-II ligands. The HLA allotypes are representative for the world population. We observe that immunopeptidomes differ considerably between tissues and individuals on source protein and HLA-ligand level. Moreover, we discover 1407 HLA-I ligands from non-canonical genomic regions. Such peptides were previously described in tumors, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), healthy lung tissues and cell lines. In a case study in glioblastoma, we show that potential on-target off-tumor adverse events in immunotherapy can be avoided by comparing tumor immunopeptidomes to the provided multi-tissue reference. CONCLUSION: Given that T-cell-based immunotherapies, such as CAR-T cells, affinity-enhanced T cell transfer, cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibition, have significant side effects, the HLA Ligand Atlas is the first step toward defining tumor-associated targets with an improved safety profile. The resource provides insights into basic and applied immune-associated questions in the context of cancer immunotherapy, infection, transplantation, allergy and autoimmunity. It is publicly available and can be browsed in an easy-to-use web interface at https://hla-ligand-atlas.org .
PXD011527	33859001	An intercrypt subpopulation of goblet cells is essential for colonic mucus barrier function. 	Ileum and colon goblet cell proteome	colon, goblet cells, ileum	The intestinal mucus layer, an important element of epithelial protection, is produced by goblet cells. Intestinal goblet cells are assumed to be a homogeneous cell type. In this study, however, we delineated their specific gene and protein expression profiles and identified several distinct goblet cell populations that form two differentiation trajectories. One distinct subtype, the intercrypt goblet cells (icGCs), located at the colonic luminal surface, produced mucus with properties that differed from the mucus secreted by crypt-residing goblet cells. Mice with defective icGCs had increased sensitivity to chemically induced colitis and manifested spontaneous colitis with age. Furthermore, alterations in mucus and reduced numbers of icGCs were observed in patients with both active and remissive ulcerative colitis, which highlights the importance of icGCs in maintaining functional protection of the epithelium.
PXD019620	33859181	Wobble tRNA modification and hydrophilic amino acid patterns dictate protein fate. 	Wobble tRNA modification dependent proteome	Cancer, elongator, tRNA modification	Regulation of mRNA translation elongation impacts nascent protein synthesis and integrity and plays a critical role in disease establishment. Here, we investigate features linking regulation of codon-dependent translation elongation to protein expression and homeostasis. Using knockdown models of enzymes that catalyze the mcm(5)s(2) wobble uridine tRNA modification (U34-enzymes), we show that gene codon content is necessary but not sufficient to predict protein fate. While translation defects upon perturbation of U34-enzymes are strictly dependent on codon content, the consequences on protein output are determined by other features. Specific hydrophilic motifs cause protein aggregation and degradation upon codon-dependent translation elongation defects. Accordingly, the combination of codon content and the presence of hydrophilic motifs define the proteome whose maintenance relies on U34-tRNA modification. Together, these results uncover the mechanism linking wobble tRNA modification to mRNA translation and aggregation to maintain proteome homeostasis.
PXD024155	33859315	Chd8 regulates X chromosome inactivation in mouse through fine-tuning control of Xist expression. 	Role of Chd8 in Xist regulation	X chromosome inactivation (XCI), Xist, epigenetics	Female mammals achieve dosage compensation by inactivating one of their two X chromosomes during development, a process entirely dependent on Xist, an X-linked long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). At the onset of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), Xist is up-regulated and spreads along the future inactive X chromosome. Contextually, it recruits repressive histone and DNA modifiers that transcriptionally silence the X chromosome. Xist regulation is tightly coupled to differentiation and its expression is under the control of both pluripotency and epigenetic factors. Recent evidence has suggested that chromatin remodelers accumulate at the X Inactivation Center (XIC) and here we demonstrate a new role for Chd8 in Xist regulation in differentiating ES cells, linked to its control and prevention of spurious transcription factor interactions occurring within Xist regulatory regions. Our findings have a broader relevance, in the context of complex, developmentally-regulated gene expression.
PXD023558	33859415	A genome-wide atlas of co-essential modules assigns function to uncharacterized genes. 	A genome-wide atlas of co-essential modules assigns function to uncharacterized genes	C15orf57, IP-MS, TMEM189	A central question in the post-genomic era is how genes interact to form biological pathways. Measurements of gene dependency across hundreds of cell lines have been used to cluster genes into 'co-essential' pathways, but this approach has been limited by ubiquitous false positives. In the present study, we develop a statistical method that enables robust identification of gene co-essentiality and yields a genome-wide set of functional modules. This atlas recapitulates diverse pathways and protein complexes, and predicts the functions of 108 uncharacterized genes. Validating top predictions, we show that TMEM189 encodes plasmanylethanolamine desaturase, a key enzyme for plasmalogen synthesis. We also show that C15orf57 encodes a protein that binds the AP2 complex, localizes to clathrin-coated pits and enables efficient transferrin uptake. Finally, we provide an interactive webtool for the community to explore our results, which establish co-essentiality profiling as a powerful resource for biological pathway identification and discovery of new gene functions.
PXD022175	33859439	PCprophet: a framework for protein complex prediction and differential analysis using proteomic data. 	Analalysis of ASB6-UBA3-NAE1 interaction	ASB6 pulldown, DDA and PRM	Despite the availability of methods for analyzing protein complexes, systematic analysis of complexes under multiple conditions remains challenging. Approaches based on biochemical fractionation of intact, native complexes and correlation of protein profiles have shown promise. However, most approaches for interpreting cofractionation datasets to yield complex composition and rearrangements between samples depend considerably on protein-protein interaction inference. We introduce PCprophet, a toolkit built on size exclusion chromatography-sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectrometry (SEC-SWATH-MS) data to predict protein complexes and characterize their changes across experimental conditions. We demonstrate improved performance of PCprophet over state-of-the-art approaches and introduce a Bayesian approach to analyze altered protein-protein interactions across conditions. We provide both command-line and graphical interfaces to support the application of PCprophet to any cofractionation MS dataset, independent of separation or quantitative liquid chromatography-MS workflow, for the detection and quantitative tracking of protein complexes and their physiological dynamics.
PXD006191	33859640	Dynamic Intracellular Metabolic Cell Signaling Profiles During Ag-Dependent B-Cell Differentiation. 	Protein landscape for human B-cell differentiation	B-cell differentiation, centroblast, centrocyte, memory, naive, plasmablast, protein quantification	Human B-cell differentiation has been extensively investigated on genomic and transcriptomic grounds; however, no studies have accomplished so far detailed analysis of antigen-dependent maturation-associated human B-cell populations from a proteomic perspective. Here, we investigate for the first time the quantitative proteomic profiles of B-cells undergoing antigen-dependent maturation using a label-free LC-MS/MS approach applied on 5 purified B-cell subpopulations (naive, centroblasts, centrocytes, memory and plasma B-cells) from human tonsils (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD006191). Our results revealed that the actual differences among these B-cell subpopulations are a combination of expression of a few maturation stage-specific proteins within each B-cell subset and maturation-associated changes in relative protein expression levels, which are related with metabolic regulation. The considerable overlap of the proteome of the 5 studied B-cell subsets strengthens the key role of the regulation of the stoichiometry of molecules associated with metabolic regulation and programming, among other signaling cascades (such as antigen recognition and presentation and cell survival) crucial for the transition between each B-cell maturation stage.
PXD024378	33859983	Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 Promotes Bladder Hypertrophy Caused by Partial Bladder Outlet Obstruction. 	Fibroblast growth factor 2 promotes bladder hypertrophy caused by partial bladder outlet obstruction	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Bladder hypertrophy, Bladder outlet obstruction, Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Protein Misfolding and Aggregation (B/D-HPP), Rat	Non-invasive biomarkers to identify patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO)-related dysfunction are still needed to guide clinical practice. The current study aims to investigate molecular alterations and biomarkers associated with partial BOO (PBOO) in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish the BOO model. Serum samples from 60 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. RNA sequencing and TMT-labeling proteomic analyses were conducted to identify molecular alterations. Masson's trichrome, H&E, and immunohistochemical staining and western blotting were conducted by using conventional methods following the manufacturer's instructions. Rats with PBOO experienced hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells and hyperplasia of interstitial cells during the first 4 weeks after the initiation of obstruction. Four weeks later, rats with PBOO showed activation of the adaptive immune response, cell death and apoptosis. The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in the serum gradually increased in the first 4 weeks and gradually decreased after week 4. FGF2 levels slightly correlated with prostate volume (R = 0.156, P = 0.0028) but not with age or BMI in BPH patients. No correlations were found between BDNF levels and prostate volume, age or BMI. BOO induces a change from bladder compensation to decompensation at week 4. FGF2 is involved in the development of hypertrophy in the PBOO bladder and shows a positive correlation with prostate volume in BPH patients.
PXD023570	33861516	Proteome characterisation of extracellular vesicles isolated from heart. 	Heart extracellular vesicle proteome	Extracellular Vesicles, Heart, Signaling	Cardiac intercellular communication is critical for heart function and often dysregulated in cardiovascular diseases. While cardiac extracellular vesicles (cEVs) are emerging mediators of signalling, their isolation remains a technical challenge hindering our understanding of cEV protein composition. Here, we utilised Langendorff-collagenase-based enzymatic perfusion and differential centrifugation to isolate cEVs from mouse heart (yield 3-6 mug/heart). cEVs are ~200 nm, express classical EV markers (Cd63/81/9(+) , Tsg101(+) , Pdcd6ip/Alix(+) ), and are depleted of blood (Alb/Fga/Hba) and cardiac damage markers (Mb, Tnnt2, Ldhb). Comparison with mechanically-derived EVs revealed greater detection of EV markers and decreased cardiac damage contaminants. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic profiling revealed 1721 proteins in cEVs, implicated in proteasomal and autophagic proteostasis, glycolysis, and fatty acid metabolism; essential functions often disrupted in cardiac pathologies. There was striking enrichment of 942 proteins in cEVs compared to mouse heart tissue - implicated in EV biogenesis, antioxidant activity, and lipid transport, suggesting active cargo selection and specialised function. Interestingly, cEVs contain marker proteins for cardiomyocytes, cardiac progenitors, B-cells, T-cells, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and cardiac fibroblasts, suggesting diverse cellular origin. We present a method of cEV isolation and provide insight into potential functions, enabling future studies into EV roles in cardiac physiology and disease.
PXD020441	33863878	Global phosphoproteomics reveals DYRK1A regulates CDK1 activity in glioblastoma cells. 	Global Phosphoproteomics of DYRK1A Inhibition in Glioblastoma Cells	DYRK1A, U251, cancer, glioblastoma, phosphoproteome, phosphoproteomics, phosphorylation, post-translational modification, signal transduction	Both tumour suppressive and oncogenic functions have been reported for dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). Herein, we performed a detailed investigation to delineate the role of DYRK1A in glioblastoma. Our phosphoproteomic and mechanistic studies show that DYRK1A induces degradation of cyclin B by phosphorylating CDC23, which is necessary for the function of the anaphase-promoting complex, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades mitotic proteins. DYRK1A inhibition leads to the accumulation of cyclin B and activation of CDK1. Importantly, we established that the phenotypic response of glioblastoma cells to DYRK1A inhibition depends on both retinoblastoma (RB) expression and the degree of residual DYRK1A activity. Moderate DYRK1A inhibition leads to moderate cyclin B accumulation, CDK1 activation and increased proliferation in RB-deficient cells. In RB-proficient cells, cyclin B/CDK1 activation in response to DYRK1A inhibition is neutralized by the RB pathway, resulting in an unchanged proliferation rate. In contrast, complete DYRK1A inhibition with high doses of inhibitors results in massive cyclin B accumulation, saturation of CDK1 activity and cell cycle arrest, regardless of RB status. These findings provide new insights into the complexity of context-dependent DYRK1A signalling in cancer cells.
PXD024246	33864425	Plasma proteomics analysis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients revealed by Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. 	Plasma proteomics analysis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients revealed by Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry	adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, mass spectrum, plasma proteome	OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the changes of plasma proteome among mild, severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients and healthy controls. METHODS: In this retrospective study, there were 84 individuals including 56 confirmed AIS patients (27 follow-up AIS patients and 29 surgical AIS patients) and another 28 healthy teenagers. Plasma samples were obtained and Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer was performed to identify proteins in AIS patients and control group. T-test and ANOVA were performed to screen for differential proteins. GO and KEGG pathway, Pearson's correlation analysis and PLS model were applied to identify enriched proteins, investigate correlation between proteins and Cobb angles. ELISA was performed to further verify the quantitative proteomics results. RESULTS: A total of 349 proteins were identified, among which 55 protein levels changed significantly in AIS group, compared with control group. Post hoc test indicated 36 proteins were significantly different between surgical and control group, 35 proteins between follow-up and control group. Fibronectin, fibrinogen and calmodulin were statistically different among three groups through mass spectrometry and were positively correlated with the Cobb angle. CONCLUSIONS: We performed the proteomic study and revealed that fibronectin, fibrinogen and calmodulin might not only be considered as biomarkers for AIS but could be correlated with curve severity.
PXD024640	33864814	SAGA and SAGA-like SLIK transcriptional coactivators are structurally and biochemically equivalent. 	BS3 intermolecular crosslinking map of SAGA and SLIK (SAGA-like) transcription coactivators	Cryo-electron microscopy, DNA-protein interaction, Histone acetylation, Histone deubiquitination, Transcriptional coactivator	The SAGA-like complex SLIK is a modified version of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex. SLIK is formed through C-terminal truncation of the Spt7 SAGA subunit, causing loss of Spt8, one of the subunits that interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP). SLIK and SAGA are both coactivators of RNA polymerase II transcription in yeast, and both SAGA and SLIK perform chromatin modifications. The two complexes have been speculated to uniquely contribute to transcriptional regulation, but their respective contributions are not clear. To investigate, we assayed the chromatin modifying functions of SAGA and SLIK, revealing identical kinetics on minimal substrates in vitro. We also examined the binding of SAGA and SLIK to TBP and concluded that interestingly, both protein complexes have similar affinity for TBP. Additionally, despite the loss of Spt8 and C-terminus of Spt7 in SLIK, TBP prebound to SLIK is not released in the presence of TATA-box DNA, just like TBP prebound to SAGA. Furthermore, we determined a low-resolution cryo-EM structure of SLIK, revealing a modular architecture identical to SAGA. Finally, we performed a comprehensive study of DNA-binding properties of both coactivators. Purified SAGA and SLIK both associate with ssDNA and dsDNA with high affinity (KD = 10-17 nM), and the binding is sequence-independent. In conclusion, our study shows that the cleavage of Spt7 and the absence of the Spt8 subunit in SLIK neither drive any major conformational differences in its structure compared with SAGA, nor significantly affect HAT, DUB, or DNA-binding activities in vitro.
PXD023797	33865858	The Escherichia coli S2P intramembrane protease RseP regulates ferric citrate uptake by cleaving the sigma factor regulator FecR. 	Escherichia coli S2P family intramembrane protease RseP is engaged in the regulated sequential cleavages of FecR in the ferric citrate signaling	E.coli, TMT, membrane	Escherichia coli RseP, a member of the site-2 protease family of intramembrane proteases, is involved in the activation of the sigma(E) extracytoplasmic stress response and elimination of signal peptides from the cytoplasmic membrane. However, whether RseP has additional cellular functions is unclear. In this study, we used mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis to search for new substrates that might reveal unknown physiological roles for RseP. Our data showed that the levels of several Fec system proteins encoded by the fecABCDE operon (fec operon) were significantly decreased in an RseP-deficient strain. The Fec system is responsible for the uptake of ferric citrate, and the transcription of the fec operon is controlled by FecI, an alternative sigma factor, and its regulator FecR, a single-pass transmembrane protein. Assays with a fec operon expression reporter demonstrated that the proteolytic activity of RseP is essential for the ferric citrate-dependent upregulation of the fec operon. Analysis using the FecR protein and FecR-derived model proteins showed that FecR undergoes sequential processing at the membrane and that RseP participates in the last step of this sequential processing to generate the N-terminal cytoplasmic fragment of FecR that participates in the transcription of the fec operon with FecI. A shortened FecR construct was not dependent on RseP for activation, confirming this cleavage step is the essential and sufficient role of RseP. Our study unveiled that E. coli RseP performs the intramembrane proteolysis of FecR, a novel physiological role that is essential for regulating iron uptake by the ferric citrate transport system.
PXD021487	33866785	Heterogeneity of Lipid and Protein Cartilage Profiles Associated with Human Osteoarthritis with or without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. 	Lipid and protein profiles associated to human osteoarthritis type 2 diabetes phenotype	Diabetes (B/D-HPP), Human Proteome Project, Human osteoarthritis type 2 diabete, ProteomeXchange project tag: Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP)	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial pathology and comprises a wide range of distinct phenotypes. In this context, the characterization of the different molecular profiles associated with each phenotype can improve the classification of OA. In particular, OA can coexist with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study investigates lipidomic and proteomic differences between human OA/T2DM(-) and OA/T2DM(+) cartilage through a multimodal mass spectrometry approach. Human cartilage samples were obtained after total knee replacement from OA/T2DM(-) and OA/T2DM(+) patients. Label-free proteomics was employed to study differences in protein abundance and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) for spatially resolved-lipid analysis. Label-free proteomic analysis showed differences between OA/T2DM(-) and OA/T2DM(+) phenotypes in several metabolic pathways such as lipid regulation. Interestingly, phospholipase A2 protein was found increased within the OA/T2DM(+) cohort. In addition, MALDI-MSI experiments revealed that phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species were characteristic of the OA/T2DM(-) group, whereas lysolipids were more characteristic of the OA/T2DM(+) phenotype. The data also pointed out differences in phospholipid content between superficial and deep layers of the cartilage. Our study shows distinctively different lipid and protein profiles between OA/T2DM(-) and OA/T2DM(+) human cartilage, demonstrating the importance of subclassification of the OA disease for better personalized treatments.
PXD022203	33867982	COE Inhibits Vasculogenic Mimicry by Targeting EphA2 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma, a Research Based on Proteomics Analysis. 	Proteomics analysis on COE inhibiting vasculogenic mimicry in hepatocellular carcinoma	EphA2, cancer treatment, hepatocellular carcinoma, vasculogenic mimicry	New strategies and drugs are urgently needed to improve the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) has been elucidated being associated with the progression of HCC and anti-VM could be a promising strategy. Celastrus orbiculatu s extract (COE), a mixture of 26 compounds isolated from the Chinese Herb Celastrus Orbiculatus Vine, has been elucidated to be able to disrupt VM formation in HCC. This study aims to dissect and identify the potential targets of COE on anti-VM formation both in vitro and in vivo that are distinct from our previous study. Proteomics analysis was used to identify differential proteins in HCC cells treated with or without COE (Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022203). Cells invasion was examined using Transwell. Matrigel was used to establish a 3-D culture condition for VM formation in vitro. RT-PCR and Western Blot were used to examine changes of mRNA and protein respectively. Clinical resected samples were applied to confirm association between VM formation and identified targets. Subcutaneous xenograft tumor model was established to observe tumor growth and VM formation in vivo. PAS-CD34 dual staining was used to detect VM in vivo. A total of 194 proteins were identified to be differentially expressed in HCC cells treated with or without COE. In the 93 down-regulated proteins EphA2 stood out to be regulated on both RNA and protein level. Disruption EphA2 using COE or NVP inhibited VM formation and decreased VM associated biomarkers. In xenograft mouse model, COE inhibited tumor growth and VM formation via down-regulating EphA2. Taken together, our results indicate that COE could be used in HCC treatment because of its promising anti-VM effect.
PXD022404	33868213	Substrate Inhibition of 5beta-Delta(4)-3-Ketosteroid Dehydrogenase in Sphingobium sp. Strain Chol11 Acts as Circuit Breaker During Growth With Toxic Bile Salts. 	Shingobium sp. strain Chol11 MALDI-TOF MS	2DE, MALDI-TOF, Shingobium sp. strain Chol11	In contrast to many steroid hormones and cholesterol, mammalian bile salts are 5beta-steroids, which leads to a bent structure of the steroid core. Bile salts are surface-active steroids excreted into the environment in large amounts, where they are subject to bacterial degradation. Bacterial steroid degradation is initiated by the oxidation of the A-ring leading to canonical Delta(4)-3-keto steroids with a double bond in the A-ring. For 5beta-bile salts, this Delta(4)-double bond is introduced into 3-keto-bile salts by a 5beta-Delta(4)-ketosteroid dehydrogenase (5beta-Delta(4)-KSTD). With the Nov2c019 protein from bile-salt degrading Sphingobium sp. strain Chol11, a novel 5beta-Delta(4)-KSTD for bile-salt degradation belonging to the Old Yellow Enzyme family was identified and named 5beta-Delta(4)-KSTD1. By heterologous production in Escherichia coli, 5beta-Delta(4)-KSTD function could be shown for 5beta-Delta(4)-KSTD1 as well as the homolog CasH from bile-salt degrading Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. The deletion mutant of 5beta-Delta(4)-kstd1 had a prolonged lag-phase with cholate as sole carbon source and, in accordance with the function of 5beta-Delta(4)-KSTD1, showed delayed 3-ketocholate transformation. Purified 5beta-Delta(4)-KSTD1 was specific for 5beta-steroids in contrast to 5alpha-steroids and converted steroids with a variety of hydroxy groups regardless of the presence of a side chain. 5beta-Delta(4)-KSTD1 showed a relatively low K m for 3-ketocholate, a very high specific activity and pronounced substrate inhibition. With respect to the toxicity of bile salts, these kinetic properties indicate that 5beta-Delta(4)-KSTD1 can achieve fast detoxification of the detergent character as well as prevention of an overflow of the catabolic pathway in presence of increased bile-salt concentrations.
PXD022445	33869165	Transcriptional Repression of MFG-E8 Causes Disturbance in the Homeostasis of Cell Cycle Through DOCK/ZP4/STAT Signaling in Buffalo Mammary Epithelial Cells. 	Transcriptional repression of MFG-E8 causes disturbance in the homeostasis of Cell cycle through DOCK/ZP4/STAT signaling in mammary epithelial cells	Cell proliferation, Cytoscape, KEGG, Milk Fat Globule Epithelial Growth Factor-8, Quantitative proteomics	The mammary gland is a unique apocrine gland made up of a branching network of ducts that end in alveoli. It is an ideal system to study the molecular mechanisms associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenesis. MFG-E8, also known as Lactadherin, is a vital glycoprotein related to the milk fat globule membrane and initially identified to get secreted in bovine milk. Our previous report suggests that a high level of MFG-E8 is indicative of high milk yield in dairy animals. Here, we showed that MFG-E8 controls the cell growth and morphology of epithelial cells through a network of regulatory transcription factors. To understand the comprehensive action, we downregulated its expression in MECs by MFG-E8 specific shRNA. We generated a knockdown proteome profile of differentially expressed proteins through a quantitative iTRAQ experiment on a high-resolution mass spectrometer (Q-TOF). The downregulation of MFG-E8 resulted in reduced phagocytosis and cell migration ability, whereas it also leads to more lifespan to knockdown vis-a-vis healthy cells, which is confirmed through BrdU, MTT, and Caspase 3/7. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that MFG-E8 knockdown perturbs a large number of intracellular signaling, eventually leading to cessation in cell growth. Based on the directed network analysis, we found that MFG-E8 is activated by CX3CL1, TP63, and CSF2 and leads to the activation of SOCS3 and CCL2 for the regulation of cell proliferation. We further proved that the depletion of MFG-E8 resulted in activated cytoskeletal remodeling by MFG-E8 knockdown, which results in the activation of three independent pathways ZP4/JAK-STAT5, DOCK1/STAT3, and PIP3/AKT/mTOR. Overall, this study suggests that MFG-E8 expression in mammary epithelial cells is an indication of intracellular deterioration in cell health. To date, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores the downstream targets of MFG-E8 involved in the regulation of mammary epithelial cell health.
PXD016900	33869930	Urinary Proteomic Characteristics of Hyperuricemia and Their Possible Links with the Occurrence of Its Concomitant Diseases. 	Urinary Proteomic Characteristics of Hyperuricemia and Their Possible Links with the Occurrence of Hyperlipidemia and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Hyperlipidemia, Hyperuricemia, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Urinary proteomics	Hyperuricemia (HUA), a chronic disease caused by metabolic disorders of purine, is often accompanied by other diseases such as gout, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hyperlipidemia. However, little is known about the relationship between HUA and these diseases on the protein level. We performed label-free liquid chromatography MS/MS spectrometry analysis of urine samples from 26 HUA patients and 25 healthy controls, attempting to establish the possible protein links between HUA and these diseases by profiling urine proteome. A total of 2119 proteins were characterized in sample proteomes. Among them, 11 were found decreased and 2 were found increased in HUA samples. Plausible pathways found by enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) include the processes for insulin receptor recycling and lipid metabolism, suggesting potential links between HUA and T2DM and hyperlipidemia. The abundance changes of three key proteins (VATB1, CFAD, and APOC3) involved in these processes were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In conclusion, our result provides proteomic evidence, for the first time, that the aberrant pathways enriched by described key DEPs are closely related to the incidence of HUA and its concomitant diseases.
PXD018023	33870183	Urinary Metabolomic and Proteomic Analyses in a Mouse Model of Prostatic Inflammation. 	Urinary Metabolomic and Proteomic Analyses of a Prostatic Inflammation Mouse Model	Metandem, isobaric labeling, label free., lower urinary tract symptoms, metabolomics, prostatic inflammation, urine	Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common among aging men. Since prostatic inflammation is one of its etiologies, it is plausible that urinary metabolite and protein biomarkers could be identified and used to diagnose inflammation-induced LUTS. We characterized the urine metabolome and proteome in a mouse model of bacterial-induced prostatic inflammation. Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based multi-omics analysis was employed to discover urinary protein and metabolite-based biomarkers. The investigation of isobaric dimethylated leucine (DiLeu) labeling on metabolites allowed metabolomics and proteomics analysis on the same liquid chromatography (LC)-MS platform. In total, 143 amine-containing metabolites and 1058 urinary proteins were identified and quantified (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD018023); among them, 14 metabolites and 168 proteins were significantly changed by prostatic inflammation. Five metabolic pathways and four inflammation-related biological processes were potentially disrupted. By comparing our findings with urinary biomarkers identified in a mouse model of genetic-induced prostate inflammation and with those previously found to be associated with LUTS in older men, we identified creatine, haptoglobin, immunoglobulin kappa constant and polymeric Ig receptor as conserved biomarkers for prostatic inflammation associated with LUTS. These data suggest that these putative biomarkers could be used to identify men in which prostate inflammation is present and contributing to LUTS.
PXD022351	33870196	Inhibition of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase impairs DNA damage tolerance and repair in glioma cells. 	Inhibition of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase impairs DNA damage tolerance and repair in glioma cells	3-dioxygenase, DNA damage, DNA repair, DNA replication, kynurenine, replication stress, tryptophan 2	Expression of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) is a determinant of malignancy in gliomas through kynurenine (KYN) signaling. We report that inhibition of TDO activity attenuated recovery from replication stress and increased the genotoxic effects of bis-chloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU). Activation of the Chk1 arm of the replication stress response (RSR) was reduced when TDO activity was blocked prior to BCNU treatment, whereas phosphorylation of serine 33 (pS33) on replication protein A (RPA) was enhanced-indicative of increased fork collapse. Analysis of quantitative proteomic results revealed that TDO inhibition reduced nuclear 53BP1 and sirtuin levels. We confirmed that cells lacking TDO activity exhibited elevated gamma-H2AX signal and defective recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin following BCNU treatment, which corresponded with delayed repair of DNA breaks. Addition of exogenous KYN increased the rate of break repair. TDO inhibition diminished SIRT7 deacetylase recruitment to chromatin, which increased histone H3K18 acetylation-a key mark involved in preventing 53BP1 recruitment to sites of DNA damage. TDO inhibition also sensitized cells to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced damage, but this effect did not involve altered 53BP1 recruitment. These experiments support a model where TDO-mediated KYN signaling helps fuel a robust response to replication stress and DNA damage.
PXD022539	33871153	Reciprocal regulation between the negative regulator PP2CG1 phosphatase and the positive regulator OST1 kinase confers cold response in Arabidopsis. 	Cold-induced phosphorylational sites analysis of protein kinase OST1	Cold-induced, OST1, phospho-sites	Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have been reported to play important roles in plant cold responses. In addition, phospho-regulatory feedback is a conserved mechanism for biological processes and stress responses in animals and plants. However, it is less well known that a regulatory feedback loop is formed by the protein kinase and the protein phosphatase in plant responses to cold stress. Here, we report that OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1) and PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C G GROUP 1 (PP2CG1) reciprocally regulate the activity during the cold stress response. The interaction of PP2CG1 and OST1 is inhibited by cold stress, which results in the release of OST1 at the cytoplasm and nucleus from suppression by PP2CG1. Interestingly, cold-activated OST1 phosphorylates PP2CG1 to suppress its phosphatase activity, thereby amplifying cold signaling in plants. Mutations of PP2CG1 and its homolog PP2CG2 enhance freezing tolerance, whereas overexpression of PP2CG1 decreases freezing tolerance. Moreover, PP2CG1 negatively regulates protein levels of C-REPEAT BINDING FACTORs (CBFs) under cold stress. Our results uncover a phosphor/dephosphor-regulatory feedback loop mediated by PP2CG1 phosphatase and OST1 protein kinase in plant cold responses.
PXD020020	33871169	Sequence of proteome profiles in preclinical and symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. 	Alzheimer disease neocortex LC-MSMS	Alzheimer, neocortex	Proteome profile changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains have been reported. However, it is unclear whether they represent a continuous process, or whether there is a sequential involvement of distinct proteins. To address this question, we used mass spectrometry. We analyzed soluble, dispersible, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and formic acid fractions of neocortex homogenates (mainly Brodmann area 17-19) from 18 pathologically diagnosed preclinical AD, 17 symptomatic AD, and 18 cases without signs of neurodegeneration. By doing so, we identified four groups of AD-related proteins being changed in levels in preclinical and symptomatic AD cases: early-responding, late-responding, gradually-changing, and fraction-shifting proteins. Gene ontology analysis of these proteins and all known AD-risk/causative genes identified vesicle endocytosis and the secretory pathway-related processes as an early-involved AD component. In conclusion, our findings suggest that subtle changes involving the secretory pathway and endocytosis precede severe proteome changes in symptomatic AD as part of the preclinical phase of AD. The respective early-responding proteins may also contribute to synaptic vesicle cycle alterations in symptomatic AD.
PXD024188	33871355	Competitive binding of STATs to receptor phospho-Tyr motifs accounts for altered cytokine responses. 	Competitive binding of STATs to receptor phospho-Tyr motifs accounts for altered cytokine responses in autoimmune disorders	IL-27, IL-6, human Th-1	Cytokines elicit pleiotropic and non-redundant activities despite strong overlap in their usage of receptors, JAKs and STATs molecules. We use IL-6 and IL-27 to ask how two cytokines activating the same signaling pathway have different biological roles. We found that IL-27 induces more sustained STAT1 phosphorylation than IL-6, with the two cytokines inducing comparable levels of STAT3 phosphorylation. Mathematical and statistical modeling of IL-6 and IL-27 signaling identified STAT3 binding to GP130, and STAT1 binding to IL-27Ralpha, as the main dynamical processes contributing to sustained pSTAT1 levels by IL-27. Mutation of Tyr613 on IL-27Ralpha decreased IL-27-induced STAT1 phosphorylation by 80% but had limited effect on STAT3 phosphorgylation. Strong receptor/STAT coupling by IL-27 initiated a unique gene expression program, which required sustained STAT1 phosphorylation and IRF1 expression and was enriched in classical Interferon Stimulated Genes. Interestingly, the STAT/receptor coupling exhibited by IL-6/IL-27 was altered in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). IL-6/IL-27 induced a more potent STAT1 activation in SLE patients than in healthy controls, which correlated with higher STAT1 expression in these patients. Partial inhibition of JAK activation by sub-saturating doses of Tofacitinib specifically lowered the levels of STAT1 activation by IL-6. Our data show that receptor and STATs concentrations critically contribute to shape cytokine responses and generate functional pleiotropy in health and disease.
PXD021692	33872026	Ciprofloxacin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Displays Enhanced Resistance and Virulence in Iron-Restricted Conditions. 	Ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus keeps resistance and virulence in Iron-restricted Condition	Staphylococcus aureus, iron-restricted, virulence	The unreasonable misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of large-scale drug-resistant bacteria, seriously threatening human health. Compared with drug-sensitive bacteria, resistant bacteria are difficult to clear by host immunity. To fully explore the adaptive mechanism of resistant bacteria to the iron-restricted environment, we performed data-independent acquisition-based quantitative proteomics on ciprofloxacin (CIP)-resistant (CIP-R) Staphylococcus aureus in the presence or absence of iron. On bioinformatics analysis, CIP-R bacteria showed stronger amino acid synthesis and energy storage ability. Notably, CIP-R bacteria increased virulence by upregulating the expression of many virulence-related proteins and enhancing the synthesis of virulence-related amino acids under iron-restricted stress. This study will help us to further explain the adaptive mechanisms that lead to bacterial resistance to antibiotics depending on the host environment and provide insights into the development of novel drugs for the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections.
PXD023169	33872496	Flash Oxidation (FOX) System: A Novel Laser-Free Fast Photochemical Oxidation Protein Footprinting Platform. 	The Flash Oxidation (FOX) System: A Novel Laser-free Fast Photochemical Oxidation Protein Footprinting Platform	FPOP, Flash photolysis, HRPF, tumor necrosis factor-alpha	Hydroxyl radical protein footprinting (HRPF) is a powerful and flexible technique for probing changes in protein topography. With the development of the fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP), it became possible for researchers to perform HRPF in their laboratory on a very short time scale. While FPOP has grown significantly in popularity since its inception, adoption remains limited due to technical and safety issues involved in the operation of a hazardous Class IV UV laser and irreproducibility often caused by improper laser operation and/or differential radical scavenging by various sample components. Here, we present a new integrated FOX (Flash OXidation) Protein Footprinting System. This platform delivers sample via flow injection to a facile and safe-to-use high-pressure flash lamp with a flash duration of 10 mus fwhm. Integrated optics collect the radiant light and focus it into the lumen of a capillary flow cell. An inline radical dosimeter measures the hydroxyl radical dose delivered and allows for real-time compensation for differential radical scavenging. A programmable fraction collector collects and quenches only the sample that received the desired effective hydroxyl radical dose, diverting the carrier liquid and improperly oxidized sample to waste. We demonstrate the utility of the FOX Protein Footprinting System by determining the epitope of TNFalpha recognized by adalimumab. We successfully identify the surface of the protein that serves as the epitope for adalimumab, identifying four of the five regions previously noted by X-ray crystallography while seeing no changes in peptides not involved in the epitope interface. The FOX Protein Footprinting System allows for FPOP-like experiments with real-time dosimetry in a safe, compact, and integrated benchtop platform.
PXD024645	33872597	AKT/AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TBC1D4 disrupts the interaction with insulin-regulated aminopeptidase. 	AKT and AMPK site-specific phosphorylation on TBC1D4 biological activity	Partial Digest, TBC1D4	TBC1D4 is a 160 kDa multidomain Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP) and a downstream target of the insulin- and contraction-activated kinases AKT and AMPK. Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 has been linked to translocation of GLUT4 from storage vesicles (GSVs) to the cell surface. However, its impact on enzymatic activity is not well understood, as previous studies mostly investigated the truncated GAP domain lacking the known phosphorylation sites. In the present study, we expressed and purified recombinant full-length TBC1D4 using a baculovirus system. Size-exclusion chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that full-length TBC1D4 forms oligomers of ~600 kDa. Compared with the truncated GAP domain, full-length TBC1D4 displayed similar substrate specificity, but had a markedly higher specific GAP activity toward Rab10. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we mapped 19 Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites in TBC1D4. We determined Michaelis-Menten kinetics using in vitro phosphorylation assays with purified kinases and stable isotope-labeled gamma-[(18)O4]-ATP. These data revealed that Ser(324) (KM ~6 muM) and Thr(649) (KM ~25 muM) were preferential sites for phosphorylation by AKT, whereas Ser(348), Ser(577), Ser(595) (KM ~10 muM), Ser(711) (KM ~79 muM), and Ser(764) were found to be preferred targets for AMPK. Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 by AKT or AMPK did not alter the intrinsic RabGAP activity, but did disrupt interaction with insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), a resident protein of GSVs implicated in GLUT4 trafficking. These findings provide evidence that insulin and contraction may regulate TBC1D4 function primarily by disrupting the recruitment of the RabGAP to GLUT4 vesicles.
PXD021695	33872779	Engineering promiscuity of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase for microbial designer ester biosynthesis. 	Repurposing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase for a robust and efficient designer ester biosynthesis platform	Clostridium thermocellum, alcohol acyltransferase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, ester biosynthesis	Robust and efficient enzymes are essential modules for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies across biological systems to engineer whole-cell biocatalysts. By condensing an acyl-CoA and an alcohol, alcohol acyltransferases (AATs) can serve as interchangeable metabolic modules for microbial biosynthesis of a diverse class of ester molecules with broad applications as flavors, fragrances, solvents, and drop-in biofuels. However, the current lack of robust and efficient AATs significantly limits their compatibility with heterologous precursor pathways and microbial hosts. Through bioprospecting and rational protein engineering, we identified and engineered promiscuity of chloramphenicol acetyltransferases (CATs) from mesophilic prokaryotes to function as robust and efficient AATs compatible with at least 21 alcohol and 8 acyl-CoA substrates for microbial biosynthesis of linear, branched, saturated, unsaturated and/or aromatic esters. By plugging the best engineered CAT (CATec3 Y20F) into the gram-negative mesophilic bacterium Escherichia coli, we demonstrated that the recombinant strain could effectively convert various alcohols into desirable esters, for instance, achieving a titer of 13.9 g/L isoamyl acetate with 95% conversion by fed-batch fermentation. The recombinant E. coli was also capable of simulating the ester profile of roses with high conversion (>97%) and titer (>1 g/L) from fermentable sugars at 37 degreesC. Likewise, a recombinant gram-positive, cellulolytic, thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum harboring CATec3 Y20F could produce many of these esters from recalcitrant cellulosic biomass at elevated temperatures (>50 degreesC) due to the engineered enzyme's remarkable thermostability. Overall, the engineered CATs can serve as a robust and efficient platform for designer ester biosynthesis from renewable and sustainable feedstocks.
PXD011589	33879316	Tissue-specific modulation of gene expression in response to lowered insulin signalling in Drosophila. 	Profiling tissue-specific modulation of gene expression in response to insulin signalling in Drosophila	drosophila tissue-specific insulin longevity lifespan aging shotgun	Reduced activity of the insulin/IGF signalling network increases health during ageing in multiple species. Diverse and tissue-specific mechanisms drive the health improvement. Here, we performed tissue-specific transcriptional and proteomic profiling of long-lived Drosophila dilp2-3,5 mutants, and identified tissue-specific regulation of >3600 transcripts and >3700 proteins. Most expression changes were regulated post-transcriptionally in the fat body, and only in mutants infected with the endosymbiotic bacteria, Wolbachia pipientis, which increases their lifespan. Bioinformatic analysis identified reduced co-translational ER targeting of secreted and membrane-associated proteins and increased DNA damage/repair response proteins. Accordingly, age-related DNA damage and genome instability were lower in fat body of the mutant, and overexpression of a minichromosome maintenance protein subunit extended lifespan. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism showed altered expression in the mutant intestine, and gut-specific overexpression of a lysosomal mannosidase increased autophagy, gut homeostasis, and lifespan. These processes are candidates for combatting ageing-related decline in other organisms.
PXD024452	33879767	ARIH1 signaling promotes anti-tumor immunity by targeting PD-L1 for proteasomal degradation. 	ARIH1 Signaling Promotes Anti-tumor Immunity by Targeting PD-L1 for Proteasomal Degradation	PDL1 phosphorylation	Cancer expression of PD-L1 suppresses anti-tumor immunity. PD-L1 has emerged as a remarkable therapeutic target. However, the regulation of PD-L1 degradation is not understood. Here, we identify several compounds as inducers of PD-L1 degradation using a high-throughput drug screen. We find EGFR inhibitors promote PD-L1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation following GSK3alpha-mediated phosphorylation of Ser279/Ser283. We identify ARIH1 as the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for targeting PD-L1 to degradation. Overexpression of ARIH1 suppresses tumor growth and promotes cytotoxic T cell activation in wild-type, but not in immunocompromised mice, highlighting the role of ARIH1 in anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, combining EGFR inhibitor ES-072 with anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy results in an additive effect on both tumor growth and cytotoxic T cell activation. Our results delineate a mechanism of PD-L1 degradation and cancer escape from immunity via EGFR-GSK3alpha-ARIH1 signaling and suggest GSK3alpha and ARIH1 might be potential drug targets to boost anti-tumor immunity and enhance immunotherapies.
PXD021781	33884197	Growth factor profile in calcified cartilage from the metaphysis of a calf costochondral junction, the site of initial bone formation. 	Profile of growth factors in calf costochondral junction - the site of initial bone formation	calcified cartilage, endochondral bone formation, growth factors, osteoclasts	Endochondral bone formation is orchestrated by growth factors produced by chondrocytes and deposited in the cartilage matrix. Whilst some of these factors have been identified, the complete list and their relationship remains unknown. In the present study, the growth factors were isolated from non-calcified and calcified cartilage of costochondral junctions. Cartilage dissected from the ribs of 6-20-week-old calves was purchased from a local butcher within 24 h of the death of the animal. The isolation involved hyaluronidase digestion, guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl) extraction, HCl decalcification and GuHCl extraction of the decalcified matrix. Growth factors were purified by heparin chromatography and their quantities were estimated using ELISA. Decalcified cartilage was also used for protein sequence analysis (data are available via ProteomeXchange; ID, PXD021781). Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7), growth/differentiation factor-5 (GDF-5) and NEL-like protein-1 (NELL-1), all known growth factors that stimulate bone formation, quantitatively accounted for the majority of the material obtained in all steps of isolation. Thus, cartilage serves as a store for growth factors. During initial bone formation septoclasts release osteoclastogenesis-stimulating factors deposited in non-calcified cartilage. Osteoclasts dissolve calcified cartilage and transport the released factors required for the stimulation of osteoprogenitor cells to deposit osteoid. High concentrations of BMP-7, GDF-5 and NELL-1 at the site of initial bone formation may suggest that their synergistic action favours osteogenesis.
PXD022875	33885279	Exploring the Microbiome-Wide Lysine Acetylation, Succinylation, and Propionylation in Human Gut Microbiota. 	Lysine acylations of humangut microbiome	PTM, lysine acylation, metaproteomics, microbiome	Lysine acylations are important post-translational modifications that are present in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes and regulate diverse cellular functions. Our knowledge of the microbiome lysine acylation remains limited due to the lack of efficient analytical and bioinformatics methods for complex microbial communities. Here, we show that the serial enrichment using motif antibodies successfully captures peptides containing lysine acetylation, propionylation, and succinylation from human gut microbiome samples. A new bioinformatic workflow consisting of an unrestricted database search confidently identified >60,000 acetylated, and ~20,000 propionylated and succinylated gut microbial peptides. The characterization of these identified modification-specific metaproteomes, i.e., meta-PTMomes, demonstrates that lysine acylations are differentially distributed in microbial species with different metabolic capabilities. This study provides an analytical framework for the study of lysine acylations in the microbiome, which enables functional microbiome studies at the post-translational level.
PXD019346	33886552	Smoothened transduces Hedgehog signals via activity-dependent sequestration of PKA catalytic subunits. 	Smoothened Transduces Hedgehog Signals via Activity-Dependent Sequestration of PKA Subunits	Phosphorylation, Smoothened	The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is essential for organ development, homeostasis, and regeneration. Dysfunction of this cascade drives several cancers. To control expression of pathway target genes, the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (SMO) activates glioma-associated (GLI) transcription factors via an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that, rather than conforming to traditional GPCR signaling paradigms, SMO activates GLI by binding and sequestering protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunits at the membrane. This sequestration, triggered by GPCR kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation of SMO intracellular domains, prevents PKA from phosphorylating soluble substrates, releasing GLI from PKA-mediated inhibition. Our work provides a mechanism directly linking Hh signal transduction at the membrane to GLI transcription in the nucleus. This process is more fundamentally similar between species than prevailing hypotheses suggest. The mechanism described here may apply broadly to other GPCR- and PKA-containing cascades in diverse areas of biology.
PXD024401	33888855	Lepidopteran wing scales contain abundant cross-linked film-forming histidine-rich cuticular proteins. 	wing scale LC-MSMS ANALYSIS RAW DATA	bombyx mori, scale, wing	Scales are symbolic characteristic of Lepidoptera; however, nothing is known about the contribution of cuticular proteins (CPs) to the complex patterning of lepidopteran scales. This is because scales are resistant to solubilization, thus hindering molecular studies. Here we succeeded in dissolving developing wing scales from Bombyx mori, allowing analysis of their protein composition. We identified a distinctive class of histidine rich (His-rich) CPs (6%-45%) from developing lepidopteran scales by LC-MS/MS. Functional studies using RNAi revealed CPs with different histidine content play distinct and critical roles in constructing the microstructure of the scale surface. Moreover, we successfully synthesized films in vitro by crosslinking a 45% His-rich CP (BmorCPR152) with laccase2 using N-acetyl- dopamine or N-beta-alanyl-dopamine as the substrate. This molecular study of scales provides fundamental information about how such a fine microstructure is constructed and insights into the potential application of CPs as new biomaterials.
PXD023961	33889149	Comparative Proteomics Reveals the Anaerobic Lifestyle of Meat-Spoiling Pseudomonas Species. 	Comparative proteomics reveals the anaerobic lifestyle of meat-spoiling Pseudomonas species	Arginine fermentation, Entner-Doudoroff pathway, meat-spoilage Pseudomonas species, modified atmosphere packaging, redox stress	The ability of certain Pseudomonas (P.) species to grow or persist in anoxic habitats by either denitrification, acetate fermentation, or arginine fermentation has been described in several studies as a special property. Previously, we had isolated strains belonging to the species P. lundensis, P. weihenstephanensis, and P. fragi from anoxic modified atmosphere packaged (MAP) minced beef and further proved their anaerobic growth in vitro on agar plates. This follow-up study investigated the anaerobic growth of two strains per respective species in situ on inoculated chicken breast filet under 100% N2 modified atmosphere. We were able to prove anaerobic growth of all six strains on chicken breast filet with cell division rates of 0.2-0.8/day. Furthermore, we characterized the anaerobic metabolic lifestyle of these Pseudomonas strains by comparative proteomics, upon their cultivation in meat simulation media, which were constantly gassed with either air or 100% N2 atmospheres. From these proteomic predictions, and respective complementation by physiological experiments, we conclude that the Pseudomonas strains P. fragi, P. weihenstephanensis, P. lundensis exhibit a similar anaerobic lifestyle and employ arginine fermentation via the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway to grow anaerobically also on MAP meats. Furthermore, glucose fermentation to ethanol via the ED-pathway is predicted to enable long term survival but no true growth, while respiratory growth with nitrate as alternative electron acceptor or glucose fermentation to acetate could be excluded due to absence of essential genes. The citric acid cycle is partially bypassed by the glyoxylate shunt, functioning as the gluconeogenetic route without production of NADH2 under carbon limiting conditions as e.g., in packaged meats. Triggered by an altered redox balance, we also detected upregulation of enzymes involved in protein folding as well as disulfide bonds isomerization under anoxic conditions as a counteracting mechanism to reduce protein misfolding. Hence, this study reveals the mechanisms enabling anaerobic grow and persistence of common meat-spoiling Pseudomonas species, and further complements the hitherto limited knowledge of the anaerobic lifestyle of Pseudomonas species in general.
PXD023500	33889548	Analysis of Serum Paraoxonase 1 Using Mass Spectrometry and Lectin Immunoassay in Patients With Alpha-Fetoprotein Negative Hepatocellular Carcinoma. 	N-glycopeptide Signatures in AFP-negative HCC	Alpha-fetoprotein-negative hepatocellular carcinoma, Glycopeptide, serum	The diagnosis of AFP (alpha-fetoprotein)-negative HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) mostly relies on imaging and pathological examinations, and it lacks valuable and practical markers. Protein N-glycosylation is a crucial post-translation modifying process related to many biological functions in an organism. Alteration of N-glycosylation correlates with inflammatory diseases and infectious diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, serum N-linked intact glycopeptides with molecular weight (MW) of 40-55 kDa were analyzed in a discovery set (n = 40) including AFP-negative HCC and liver cirrhosis (LC) patients using label-free quantification methodology. Quantitative lens culinaris agglutin (LCA) ELISA was further used to confirm the difference of glycosylation on serum PON1 in liver diseases (n = 56). Then, the alteration of site-specific intact N-glycopeptides of PON1 was comprehensively assessed by using Immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectrometry based (16)O/(18)O C-terminal labeling quantification method to distinguish AFP-negative HCC from LC patients in a validation set (n = 64). Totally 195 glycopeptides were identified using a dedicated search engine pGlyco. Among them, glycopeptides from APOH, HPT/HPTR, and PON1 were significantly changed in AFP-negative HCC as compared to LC. In addition, the reactivity of PON1 with LCA in HCC patients with negative AFP was significantly elevated than that in cirrhosis patients. The two glycopeptides HAN(253)WTLTPLK (H5N4S2) and (H5N4S1) corresponding to PON1 were significantly increased in AFP-negative HCC patients, as compared with LC patients. Variations in PON1 glycosylation may be associated with AFP-negative HCC and might be helpful to serve as potential glycomic-based biomarkers to distinguish AFP-negative HCC from cirrhosis.
PXD013613	33890134	Exploring the dermotoxicity of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol: combined morphologic and proteomic profiling of human epidermal cells reveals alteration of lipid biosynthesis machinery and membrane structural integrity relevant for skin barrier function. 	Deoxynivalenol and human epidermal cells: proteomic profiling indicates alterations of cell membrane integrity and barrier function	Deoxynivalenol (DON, human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn), lipid synthesis machinery, vomitoxin)	Deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin, DON) is a secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium spp. fungi and it is one of the most prevalent mycotoxins worldwide. Crop infestation results not only in food and feed contamination, but also in direct dermal exposure, especially during harvest and food processing. To investigate the potential dermotoxicity of DON, epidermoid squamous cell carcinoma cells A431 were compared to primary human neonatal keratinocytes (HEKn) cells via proteome/phosphoproteome profiling. In A431 cells, 10 microM DON significantly down-regulated ribosomal proteins, as well as mitochondrial respiratory chain elements (OXPHOS regulation) and transport proteins (TOMM22; TOMM40; TOMM70A). Mitochondrial impairment was reflected in altered metabolic competence, apparently combined with interference of the lipid biosynthesis machinery. Functional effects on the cell membrane were confirmed by live cell imaging and membrane fluidity assays (0.1-10 microM DON). Moreover, a common denominator for both A431 and HEKn cells was a significant downregulation of the squalene synthase (FDFT1). In sum, proteome alterations could be traced back to the transcription factor Klf4, a crucial regulator of skin barrier function. Overall, these results describe decisive molecular events sustaining the capability of DON to impair skin barrier function. Proteome data generated in the study are fully accessible via ProteomeXchange with the accession numbers PXD011474 and PXD013613.
PXD023698	33892138	Proteomics analysis of hip articular cartilage identifies differentially expressed proteins associated with osteonecrosis of the femoral head. 	Proteomics analysis of hip articular cartilage identifies differentially expressed proteins associated with osteonecrosis of the femoral head	Cartilage degeneration, Osteonecrosis of femoral head, Pathogenesis, Tandem mass tag-based quantitation	OBJECTIVE: The cartilage degeneration that accompanies subchondral bone necrosis plays an important role in the development of osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONFH). To better understand the molecular basis of cartilage degradation in ONFH, we compared the proteomic profiles of ONFH cartilage with that of fracture control. DESIGN: Hip cartilage samples were collected from 16 ONFH patients and 16 matched controls with femoral neck fracture. Proteomics analysis was conducted using tandem mass tag-based quantitation technique. Gene ontology (GO) analysis, KEGG pathway and protein-protein interaction analysis were used to investigate the functions of the altered proteins and biological pathways. Differentially expressed proteins including alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG) and Cytokine-like protein 1 (Cytl1) were validated by Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: 303 differentially expressed proteins were identified in ONFH cartilage with 72 up-regulated and 231 down-regulated. Collagen turnover, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, and complement and coagulation cascades were significantly modified in ONFH cartilage. WB and IHC confirmed the increased expression of AHSG and decreased expression of Cytl1 in ONFH cartilage. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the implication of altered protein expression in the development of ONFH, and provide novel clues for pathogenesis studies of cartilage degradation in ONFH.
PXD021254	33893075	G-Protein-coupled Estrogen Receptor 1 Agonist G-1 Perturbs Sunitinib Resistance-related Phosphoproteomic Signatures in Renal Cell Carcinoma. 	Quantitative phosphoproteomics of chronic sunitinib treated renal cell carcinoma 786-O cells with GPR30 agonist G-1	GPR30, renal cell carcinoma, sunitinib	BACKGROUND: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) often develops resistance to first-line targeted therapy such as sunitinib. G-Protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) agonist G-1 was recently reported to regulate RCC physiology but the role of G-1 in RCC tumorigenesis and sunitinib resistance remains largely unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parental and sunitinib-resistant 786-O cells were treated with GPER1 agonist G-1, and quantitative phosphoproteomics was performed. Bioinformatic analyses and validations, including immunoblotting, cell migration, and cell cycle distribution, were performed. RESULTS: G-1 repressed cell proliferation and migration in both parental and sunitinib-resistant 786-O cells. Phosphoproteomic signatures, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) as well as other pathways, were up-regulated in sunitinib-resistant cells but application of G-1 reversed this effect. Among phosphoprotein candidates, activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) Thr69/71 phosphorylation was antagonistically regulated by sunitinib resistance and G-1. CONCLUSION: Our results open up the possibility for managing RCC and sunitinib resistance by GPER1 agonist G-1 and its regulated pathways.
PXD023483	33893175	Nanobody cocktails potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 D614G N501Y variant and protect mice. 	Nanobodies peptide/glycopeptide identification	MS-MS, Nanobodies, glycopeptides	Neutralizing antibodies are important for immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and as therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Here, we identified high-affinity nanobodies from alpacas immunized with coronavirus spike and receptor-binding domains (RBD) that disrupted RBD engagement with the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Epitope mapping, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy revealed two distinct antigenic sites and showed two neutralizing nanobodies from different epitope classes bound simultaneously to the spike trimer. Nanobody-Fc fusions of the four most potent nanobodies blocked ACE2 engagement with RBD variants present in human populations and potently neutralized both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the N501Y D614G variant at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM. Prophylactic administration of either single nanobody-Fc or as mixtures reduced viral loads by up to 10(4)-fold in mice infected with the N501Y D614G SARS-CoV-2 virus. These results suggest a role for nanobody-Fc fusions as prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2.
PXD022869	33893288	Specificity of AMPylation of the human chaperone BiP is mediated by TPR motifs of FICD. 	Structural basis of chaperone regulation by a post-translational modification	AMPylation, HYPE, Hsp70 chaperone BiP	To adapt to fluctuating protein folding loads in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Hsp70 chaperone BiP is reversibly modified with adenosine monophosphate (AMP) by the ER-resident Fic-enzyme FICD/HYPE. The structural basis for BiP binding and AMPylation by FICD has remained elusive due to the transient nature of the enzyme-substrate-complex. Here, we use thiol-reactive derivatives of the cosubstrate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to covalently stabilize the transient FICD:BiP complex and determine its crystal structure. The complex reveals that the TPR-motifs of FICD bind specifically to the conserved hydrophobic linker of BiP and thus mediate specificity for the domain-docked conformation of BiP. Furthermore, we show that both AMPylation and deAMPylation of BiP are not directly regulated by the presence of unfolded proteins. Together, combining chemical biology, crystallography and biochemistry, our study provides structural insights into a key regulatory mechanism that safeguards ER homeostasis.
PXD021138	33893293	Cdk5 and GSK3beta inhibit fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis. 	Cdk5 and GSK3beta inhibit fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis	LC-MS	Endocytosis mediates the cellular uptake of micronutrients and cell surface proteins. Fast Endophilin-mediated endocytosis, FEME, is not constitutively active but triggered upon receptor activation. High levels of growth factors induce spontaneous FEME, which can be suppressed upon serum starvation. This suggested a role for protein kinases in this growth factor receptor-mediated regulation. Using chemical and genetic inhibition, we find that Cdk5 and GSK3beta are negative regulators of FEME. They antagonize the binding of Endophilin to Dynamin-1 and to CRMP4, a Plexin A1 adaptor. This control is required for proper axon elongation, branching and growth cone formation in hippocampal neurons. The kinases also block the recruitment of Dynein onto FEME carriers by Bin1. As GSK3beta binds to Endophilin, it imposes a local regulation of FEME. Thus, Cdk5 and GSK3beta are key regulators of FEME, licensing cells for rapid uptake by the pathway only when their activity is low.
PXD023668	33894203	Tolerance to nascent protein misfolding stress requires fine-tuning of the cAMP/PKA pathway. 	Yeast response to protein misfolding induced by azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC)	peroxiredoxin, protein misfolding	Protein aggregation is the abnormal association of misfolded proteins into larger, often insoluble structures that can be toxic during aging and in protein aggregation-associated diseases. Previous research has established a role for the cytosolic Tsa1 peroxiredoxin in responding to protein misfolding stress. Tsa1 is also known to downregulate the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway as part of the response to hydrogen peroxide stress. However, whether the cAMP/PKA pathway is involved in protein misfolding stress is not known. Using transcriptomics, we examined the response to protein misfolding stress and found upregulation of numerous stress gene functions and downregulation of many genes related to protein synthesis and other growth-related processes consistent with the well-characterized environmental stress response. The scope of the transcriptional response is largely similar in wild-type and tsa1 mutant strains, but the magnitude is dampened in the strain lacking Tsa1. We identified a direct protein interaction between Tsa1 and the Bcy1 regulatory subunit of PKA that is present under normal growth conditions and explains the observed differences in gene expression profiles. This interaction is increased in a redox-dependent manner in response to nascent protein misfolding, via Tsa1-mediated oxidation of Bcy1. Oxidation of Bcy1 causes a reduction in cAMP binding by Bcy1, which dampens PKA pathway activity, leading to a targeted reprogramming of gene expression. Redox regulation of the regulatory subunit of PKA provides a mechanism to mitigate the toxic consequences of protein misfolding stress that is distinct to stress caused by exogenous sources of reactive oxygen species.
PXD024116	33894211	Endothelial ether lipids link the vasculature to blood pressure, behavior, and neurodegeneration. 	Endothelial ether lipids link blood vessels to neurodegeneration	Glycerophospholipids, Peroxisomes, Phospholipids/Biosynthesis, Plasmalogens, Q-Exactive, Vascular Biology/Endothelial Cells	Vascular disease contributes to neurodegeneration, which is associated with decreased blood pressure in older humans. Plasmalogens, ether phospholipids produced by peroxisomes, are decreased in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanistic links between ether phospholipids, blood pressure, and neurodegeneration are not fully understood. Here, we show that endothelium-derived ether phospholipids affect blood pressure, behavior, and neurodegeneration in mice. In young adult mice, inducible endothelial-specific disruption of PexRAP, a peroxisomal enzyme required for ether lipid synthesis, unexpectedly decreased circulating plasmalogens. PexRAP endothelial knockout (PEKO) mice responded normally to hindlimb ischemia but had lower blood pressure and increased plasma renin activity. In PEKO as compared with control mice, tyrosine hydroxylase was decreased in the locus coeruleus, which maintains blood pressure and arousal. PEKO mice moved less, slept more, and had impaired attention to and recall of environmental events as well as mild spatial memory deficits. In PEKO hippocampus, gliosis was increased, and a plasmalogen associated with memory was decreased. Despite lower blood pressure, PEKO mice had generally normal homotopic functional connectivity by optical neuroimaging of the cerebral cortex. Decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylation, a marker of neurodegeneration, was detected in PEKO cerebral cortex. In a co-culture system, PexRAP knockdown in brain endothelial cells decreased glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylation in co-cultured astrocytes that was rescued by incubation with the ether lipid alkylglycerol. Taken together, our findings suggest that endothelium-derived ether lipids mediate several biological processes and may also confer neuroprotection in mice.
PXD024687	33895140	Oxidation of peroxiredoxin-4 induces oligomerization and promotes interaction with proteins governing protein folding and endoplasmic reticulum stress. 	Oxidation of peroxiredoxin-4 induces oligomerization and promotes interaction with endoplasmic reticulum proteins	Prdx4, Tert-butyl hydroperoxide	Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). PRDX4 is the only peroxiredoxin located within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is the most highly expressed H2O2 scavenger in the ER. PRDX4 has emerged as an important player in numerous diseases, such as fibrosis and metabolic syndromes, and its overoxidation is a potential indicator of ER redox stress. It is unclear how overoxidation of PRDX4 governs its oligomerization state and interacting partners. Herein, we addressed these questions via nonreducing Western blots, mass spectrometry, and site-directed mutagenesis. We report that the oxidation of PRDX4 in lung epithelial cells treated with tertbutyl hydroperoxide caused a shift of PRDX4 from monomer/dimer to high molecular weight (HMW) species, which contain PRDX4 modified with sulfonic acid residues (PRDX4-SO3), as well as of a complement of ER-associated proteins, including protein disulfide isomerases important in protein folding, thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5, and heat shock protein A5, a key regulator of the ER stress response. Mutation of any of the four cysteines in PRDX4 altered the HMW species in response to tertbutyl hydroperoxide as well as the secretion of PRDX4. We also demonstrate that the expression of ER oxidoreductase 1 alpha, which generates H2O2 in the ER, increased PRDX4 HMW formation and secretion. These results suggest a link between SO3 modification in the formation of HMW PRDX4 complexes in cells, whereas the association of key regulators of ER homeostasis with HMW oxidized PRDX4 point to a putative role of PRDX4 in regulating ER stress responses.
PXD019719	33895336	Proteomic profiling of soft tissue sarcomas with SWATH mass spectrometry. 	Proteomic profiling of soft tissue sarcomas with SWATH mass spectrometry	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), DIA-MS, Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Cancer (B/D-HPP), SWATH-MS, sarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma	Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a group of rare and heterogeneous cancers. While large-scale genomic and epigenomic profiling of STS have been undertaken, proteomic analysis has thus far been limited. Here we utilise sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) for proteomic profiling of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens from a cohort of STS patients (n = 36) across four histological subtypes (leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma). We quantified 2951 proteins across all cases and show that there is a significant enrichment of gene sets associated with smooth muscle contraction in leiomyosarcoma, RNA splicing regulation in synovial sarcoma and leukocyte activation in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. We further identified a subgroup of STS cases that have a distinct expression profile in a panel of proteins, with worse survival outcomes when compared to the rest of the cohort. Our study highlights the value of comprehensive proteomic characterisation as a means to identify histotype-specific STS profiles that describe key biological pathways of clinical and therapeutic relevance; as well as for discovering new prognostic biomarkers in this group of rare and difficult-to-treat diseases.
PXD029179	33896563	An efficient approach based on basic strong cation exchange chromatography for enriching methylated peptides with high specificity for methylproteomics analysis. 	BaSCX method for enriching methylated peptieds	basic strong cation exchange, methlated peptides	Protein methylation as one of the most important post-translational modifications has been under the spotlight due to its essential role in many biological processes. Development of methods for large-scale analysis of protein methylation greatly accelerates the related researches. To date, antibody-based enrichment strategy is the most common approach for methylproteomics analysis. However, it is still lacking of a pan-specific antibody to enrich peptides or proteins carrying all kinds of lysine and arginine methylation forms. Herein, an online basic strong cation exchange chromatography was developed to enrich methylated peptides from protein digests prepared by two complementary methods, including direct multiple enzymes digestion and carboxylic amidation followed by multiple enzymes digestion. After enrichment, the majority of identifications were obtained from direct multiple enzymes digested sample. The enrichment specificity of methylated peptides was up to 28.5%, and 445 methylation forms corresponding to 376 methylation sites were identified on 194 proteins in one LC-MS/MS run using only 100 mug of digests. This method has great potential in studying protein methylation mediated biological processes.
PXD022838	33897275	Application of frequency multiple FT-ICR-MS signal acquisition for improved proteome research. 	Application of harmonic FT-ICR-MS signal acquisition for improved proteome research	FTICR	Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) is a powerful combination useful in many research areas due to the utility of high mass resolving power and mass measurement accuracy for studying highly complex samples. Ideally, every analyte in a complex sample can be subjected to accurate mass MS/MS analysis to aid in identification. FT-ICR MS can provide high mass resolving power and mass accuracy at the cost of long data acquisition periods, reducing the number of spectra that can be acquired per unit time. Frequency multiple signal acquisition has long been realized as an attractive method to obtain high mass resolving power and mass accuracy with shorter data acquisition periods. However, one of the limitations associated with frequency multiple signal acquisition is reduced signal intensity as compared to a traditional dipole detector. In this study, we demonstrated the use of a novel ICR cell to improve frequency multiple signal intensity and investigated the potential use of frequency multiple acquisition for proteome measurements. This novel ICR cell containing both dipole and frequency multiple detection electrodes was installed on a 7T FT-ICR MS coupled to an LC system. Tryptic digests of HeLa cell lysates were analyzed using dipole and frequency multiple detectors by holding either the mass resolving power or signal acquisition time constant. Compared to dipole detection, second frequency multiple detection yielded 36% or 45% more unique identified peptides from HeLa cell lysates at twice the scan rate or twice the mass resolving power, respectively. These results indicate that frequency multiple signal acquisition with either the same resolving power or the same signal acquisition duration as used with dipole signals can produce a significant increase in the number of peptides identified in complex proteome samples.
PXD024543	33897769	Proteome and Phosphoproteome Analyses Reveal the Kinase Regulatory Network Involved in Glycogen Synthesis Kinase 3beta. 	Proteome and phosphoproteome analyses reveal the kinase regulatory network involved in glycogen synthesis kinase 3beta	Diabetic nephropathy, GSK-3beta, Phosphoproteome, Podocytes	Diabetic nephropathy is the most common chronic kidney disease in the world and the main cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The structural integrity of podocytes is fundamental to the normal function of the glomerulus, and the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) in podocytes is complicated. A thorough understanding of GSK-3beta is crucial to understand the mechanism of diabetic nephropathy. To analyze the roles of GSK-3beta in podocytes, GSK-3beta knockdown lentivirus by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas)9 was applied to establish stable cell lines. Mass spectrometry was utilized to search for differentially expressed proteins. Consequently, we found 34 proteins with higher levels and 115 proteins with lower levels in GSk-3beta knockdown cells than in control cells and identified 581 phosphosites with higher phosphorylation levels and 288 phosphosites with lower phosphorylation levels. We performed functional enrichment analysis of these proteins and phosphorylated proteins based on public databases. Enrichment analysis revealed that GSK-3beta participates in the spliceosome, Hippo signaling pathway, actin binding, structural molecule activity, and other pathways. Then, we used motif analysis of phosphate sites to determine 89 conserved motifs based on 1,068 phosphoserine (pS) sites and 15 conserved motifs in view of 104 phosphothreonine (pT) sites. Additionally, protein-protein interaction network analysis was carried out using the STRING database. Cytoscape's add-on Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to analyze key and core protein groups. In quantitative differential protein analysis, four MCODEs were obtained, and 22 MCODEs were obtained in the analysis of the phosphoproteome of differentially expressed proteins. Finally, we analyzed the kinase regulatory network in podocytes after GSK-3beta knockdown and identified 299 protein kinases and 3,460 significantly changed phosphorylation modification sites on 1,574 proteins. These results will be valuable for further research on GSK-3beta.
PXD020205	33897873	Endogenous glutamate determines ferroptosis sensitivity via ADCY10-dependent YAP suppression in lung adenocarcinoma. 	Erastin induced protein expression change in H1975 cells	erastin, ferroptosis, lung cancer	Rationale: Ferroptosis, a newly identified form of regulated cell death, can be induced following the inhibition of cystine-glutamate antiporter system XC(-) because of the impaired uptake of cystine. However, the outcome following the accumulation of endogenous glutamate in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has not yet been determined. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is sustained by the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP)-dependent O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation), and glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (GFPT1), the rate-limiting enzyme of the HBP, can be phosphorylated and inhibited by adenylyl cyclase (ADCY)-mediated activation of protein kinase A (PKA). However, whether accumulated endogenous glutamate determines ferroptosis sensitivity by influencing the ADCY/PKA/HBP/YAP axis in LUAD cells is not understood. Methods: Cell viability, cell death and the generation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured to evaluate the responses to the induction of ferroptosis following the inhibition of system XC(-). Tandem mass tags (TMTs) were employed to explore potential factors critical for the ferroptosis sensitivity of LUAD cells. Immunoblotting (IB) and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) were used to analyze protein and mRNA expression. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed to identify protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications. Metabolite levels were measured using the appropriate kits. Transcriptional regulation was evaluated using a luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Drug administration and limiting dilution cell transplantation were performed with cell-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. The associations among clinical outcome, drug efficacy and ADCY10 expression were determined based on data from patients who underwent curative surgery and evaluated with patient-derived primary LUAD cells and tissues. Results: The accumulation of endogenous glutamate following system XC(-) inhibition has been shown to determine ferroptosis sensitivity by suppressing YAP in LUAD cells. YAP O-GlcNAcylation and expression cannot be sustained in LUAD cells upon impairment of GFPT1. Thus, Hippo pathway-like phosphorylation and ubiquitination of YAP are enhanced. ADCY10 acts as a key downstream target and diversifies the effects of glutamate on the PKA-dependent suppression of GFPT1. We also discovered that the protumorigenic and proferroptotic effects of ADCY10 are mediated separately. Advanced-stage LUADs with high ADCY10 expression are sensitive to ferroptosis. Moreover, LUAD cells with acquired therapy resistance are also prone to higher ADCY10 expression and are more likely to respond to ferroptosis. Finally, a varying degree of secondary labile iron increase is caused by the failure to sustain YAP-stimulated transcriptional compensation for ferritin at later stages further explains why ferroptosis sensitivity varies among LUAD cells. Conclusions: Endogenous glutamate is critical for ferroptosis sensitivity following the inhibition of system XC(-) in LUAD cells, and ferroptosis-based treatment is a good choice for LUAD patients with later-stage and/or therapy-resistant tumors.
PXD017779	33898396	Proteomic Profiling of IgG1 Producing CHO Cells Using LC/LC-SPS-MS(3): The Effects of Bioprocessing Conditions on Productivity and Product Quality. 	Analysis of IgG1 producing CHO cells	CHO, SPS-MS3, TMT	The biopharmaceutical market is dominated by monoclonal antibodies, the majority of which are produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Intense cell engineering, in combination with optimization of various process parameters results in increasing product titers. To enable further improvements in manufacturing processes, detailed information about how certain parameters affect cellular mechanisms in the production cells, and thereby also the expressed drug substance, is required. Therefore, in this study the effects of commonly applied changes in bioprocessing parameters on an anti-IL8 IgG1 producing CHO DP-12 cell line were investigated on the level of host cell proteome expression combined with product quality assessment of the expressed IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Applying shifts in temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen concentration, respectively, resulted in altered productivity and product quality. Furthermore, analysis of the cells using two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry employing tandem mass tag based isotopic quantitation and synchronous precursor selection-MS(3) detection revealed substantial changes in the protein expression profiles of CHO cells. Pathway analysis indicated that applied bioprocessing conditions resulted in differential activation of oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, activation of ERK5 and TNFR1 signaling suggested an affected cell cycle. Moreover, in-depth product characterization by means of charge variant analysis, peptide mapping, as well as structural and functional analysis, revealed posttranslational and structural changes in the expressed drug substance. Taken together, the present study allows the conclusion that, in anti-IL8 IgG1 producing CHO DP-12 cells, an improved energy metabolism achieved by lowering the cell culture pH is favorable when aiming towards high antibody production rates while maintaining product quality.
PXD023037	33898427	Proteome Profile of Myelin in the Zebrafish Brain. 	Proteome profile of myelin in the zebrafish brain	CD59, MBP, MPZ, Oligodendrocyte, PLP, central nervous system (CNS), danio rerio, label-free proteomics, myelin proteome, teleost, transcriptome, zebrafish	The velocity of nerve conduction along vertebrate axons depends on their ensheathment with myelin. Myelin membranes comprise specialized proteins well characterized in mice. Much less is known about the protein composition of myelin in non-mammalian species. Here, we assess the proteome of myelin biochemically purified from the brains of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), considering its increasing popularity as model organism for myelin biology. Combining gel-based and gel-free proteomic approaches, we identified > 1,000 proteins in purified zebrafish myelin, including all known constituents. By mass spectrometric quantification, the predominant Ig-CAM myelin protein zero (MPZ/P0), myelin basic protein (MBP), and the short-chain dehydrogenase 36K constitute 12%, 8%, and 6% of the total myelin protein, respectively. Comparison with previously established mRNA-abundance profiles shows that expression of many myelin-related transcripts coincides with the maturation of zebrafish oligodendrocytes. Zebrafish myelin comprises several proteins that are not present in mice, including 36K, CLDNK, and ZWI. However, a surprisingly large number of ortholog proteins is present in myelin of both species, indicating partial evolutionary preservation of its constituents. Yet, the relative abundance of CNS myelin proteins can differ markedly as exemplified by the complement inhibitor CD59 that constitutes 5% of the total zebrafish myelin protein but is a low-abundant myelin component in mice. Using novel transgenic reporter constructs and cryo-immuno electron microscopy, we confirm the incorporation of CD59 into myelin sheaths. These data provide the first proteome resource of zebrafish CNS myelin and demonstrate both similarities and heterogeneity of myelin composition between teleost fish and rodents.
PXD020543	33898438	Prednisolone Alters Endometrial Decidual Cells and Affects Decidual-Trophoblast Interactions. 	Prednisolone alters decidualization and affects decidual-trophoblast interactions	LCMS, Label free Quantification, decidualization, prednisolone, recurrent pregnancy loss, repeated implantation failure, trophoblast	Poor pregnancy outcomes such as recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and preeclampsia are associated with impaired decidualization and abnormal trophoblast invasion. Emerging evidence suggests that use of corticosteroids, including prednisolone affects fertility by altering uterine function and may be associated with preeclampsia incidence. In this study, using primary and gestational-age appropriate tissue, we aimed to define the effect of prednisolone on human endometrial stromal fibroblast (hESF) decidualization and determine whether hESF decidualization in the presence of prednisolone would alter hESF regulation of trophoblast function. We found that prednisolone treatment reduced hESF cytokine expression (IL6, IL11, IL18, LIF, and LIFR) but had no effect on hESF expression or secretion of the classic markers of decidualization [prolactin (PRL) and IGFBP1]. Using proteomics we determined that prednisolone altered decidualized hESF protein production, enriching hESF proteins associated with acetylation and mitrochondria. Conditioned media from hESF decidualized in the presence of prednisolone significantly enhanced trophoblast outgrowth and trophoblast mRNA expression of cell motility gene PLCG1 and reduced trophoblast production of PGF. Prednisolone treatment during the menstrual cycle and 1st trimester of pregnancy might alter decidual interactions with other cells, including invasive trophoblast.
PXD022322	33898456	Proteomic Changes Associated With Sperm Fertilizing Ability in Meat-Type Roosters. 	Proteomic changes associated with sperm fertilizing ability in meat type roosters	Chicken, fertility, spermatozoa	The molecular basis of male fertility remains unclear, especially in chickens, where decades of genetic selection increased male fertility variability as a side effect. As transcription and translation are highly limited in sperm, proteins are key molecules defining their functionality, making proteomic approaches one of the most adequate methods to investigate sperm capacity. In this context, it is interesting to combine complementary proteomic approaches to maximize the identification of proteins related to sperm-fertilizing ability. In the present study, we aimed at identifying proteins related to fertility in meat-type roosters, showing fertility variability. Fertile roosters (fertility rates higher than 70% after artificial insemination) differed from subfertile roosters (fertility rates lower than 40%) in their sperm mass motility. Fertile and subfertile sperm protein contents were compared using two complementary label-free quantitative proteomic methods: Intact Cell MALDI-TOF-Mass Spectrometry and GeLC-MS/MS. Combining the two strategies, 57 proteins were identified as differentially abundant. Most of them were described for the first time as differentially abundant according to fertility in this species. These proteins were involved in various molecular pathways including flagellum integrity and movement, mitochondrial functions, sperm maturation, and storage in female tract as well as oocyte-sperm interaction. Collectively, our data improved our understanding of chicken sperm biology by revealing new actors involved in the complexity of male fertility that depends on multiple cell functions to reach optimal rates. This explains the inability of reductionist in vitro fertility testing in predicting male fertility and suggests that the use of a combination of markers is a promising approach.
PXD024275	33900084	TMTpro-18plex: The Expanded and Complete Set of TMTpro Reagents for Sample Multiplexing. 	TMTpro-18plex: The Expanded and Complete Set of TMTpro Reagents for Sample Multiplexing	18plex, BYL-719, Eclipse, KIN-193, MCF10A, PTEN, Real-time search, TMTpro	The development of the TMTpro-16plex series expanded the breadth of commercial isobaric tagging reagents by nearly 50% over classic TMT-11plex. In addition to the described 16plex reagents, the proline-based TMTpro molecule can accommodate two additional combinations of heavy carbon and nitrogen isotopes. Here, we introduce the final two labeling reagents, TMTpro-134C and TMTpro-135N, which permit the simultaneous global protein profiling of 18 samples with essentially no missing values. For example, six conditions with three biological replicates can now be perfectly accommodated. We showcase the 18plex reagent set by profiling the proteome and phosphoproteome of a pair of isogenic mammary epithelial cell lines under three conditions in triplicate. We compare the depth and quantitative performance of this data set with a TMTpro-16plex experiment in which two samples were omitted. Our analysis revealed similar numbers of quantified peptides and proteins, with high quantitative correlation. We interrogated further the TMTpro-18plex data set by highlighting changes in protein abundance profiles under different conditions in the isogenic cell lines. We conclude that TMTpro-18plex further expands the sample multiplexing landscape, allowing for complex and innovative experimental designs.
PXD019279	33900085	Proteomic Profiling of the Substantia Nigra to Identify Determinants of Lewy Body Pathology and Dopaminergic Neuronal Loss. 	Proteomic Profiling of the Substantia Nigra to Identify Determinants of Lewy Body Pathology and Dopaminergic Neuronal Loss	Brain, Lewy bodies, substantia nigra	Proteinaceous aggregates containing alpha-synuclein protein called Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. The molecular mechanisms of Lewy body formation and associated neuronal loss remain largely unknown. To gain insights into proteins and pathways associated with Lewy body pathology, we performed quantitative profiling of the proteome. We analyzed substantia nigra tissue from 51 subjects arranged into three groups: cases with Lewy body pathology, Lewy body-negative controls with matching neuronal loss, and controls with no neuronal loss. Using a label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach, we characterized the proteome both in terms of protein abundances and peptide modifications. Statistical testing for differential abundance of the most abundant 2963 proteins, followed by pathway enrichment and Bayesian learning of the causal network structure, was performed to identify likely drivers of Lewy body formation and dopaminergic neuronal loss. The identified pathways include (1) Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation; (2) synaptic function; (3) poly(A) RNA binding; (4) basement membrane and endothelium; and (5) hydrogen peroxide metabolic process. According to the data, the endothelial/basement membrane pathway is tightly connected with both pathologies and likely to be one of the drivers of neuronal loss. The poly(A) RNA-binding proteins, including the ones relevant to other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., TDP-43 and FUS), have a strong inverse correlation with Lewy bodies and may reflect an alternative mechanism of nigral neurodegeneration.
PXD023954	33901176	The dominantly expressed class II molecule from a resistant MHC haplotype presents only a few Marek's disease virus peptides by using an unprecedented binding motif. 	Chicken MHC class II presented Marek's disease virus (MDV) and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) antigenic peptides	Chicken MHC, IBDV, MDV, MHC class I, MHC class II, immunopeptidomics	Viral diseases pose major threats to humans and other animals, including the billions of chickens that are an important food source as well as a public health concern due to zoonotic pathogens. Unlike humans and other typical mammals, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of chickens can confer decisive resistance or susceptibility to many viral diseases. An iconic example is Marek's disease, caused by an oncogenic herpesvirus with over 100 genes. Classical MHC class I and class II molecules present antigenic peptides to T lymphocytes, and it has been hard to understand how such MHC molecules could be involved in susceptibility to Marek's disease, given the potential number of peptides from over 100 genes. We used a new in vitro infection system and immunopeptidomics to determine peptide motifs for the 2 class II molecules expressed by the MHC haplotype B2, which is known to confer resistance to Marek's disease. Surprisingly, we found that the vast majority of viral peptide epitopes presented by chicken class II molecules arise from only 4 viral genes, nearly all having the peptide motif for BL2*02, the dominantly expressed class II molecule in chickens. We expressed BL2*02 linked to several Marek's disease virus (MDV) peptides and determined one X-ray crystal structure, showing how a single small amino acid in the binding site causes a crinkle in the peptide, leading to a core binding peptide of 10 amino acids, compared to the 9 amino acids in all other reported class II molecules. The limited number of potential T cell epitopes from such a complex virus can explain the differential MHC-determined resistance to MDV, but raises questions of mechanism and opportunities for vaccine targets in this important food species, as well as providing a basis for understanding class II molecules in other species including humans.
PXD022580	33902396	Potential functions of histone H3.3 lysine 56 acetylation in mammals. 	Potential Functions of Histone H3.3K56 Acetylation in Mammals	H3.3K56 acetylation, Triple-TOF 5600	H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac) was first identified in yeast and has recently been reported to play important roles in maintaining genomic stability, chromatin assembly, DNA replication, cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Although H3.1K56Ac has been relatively well studied, the function of H3.3K56Ac remains mostly unknown in mammals. In this study, we used H3.3K56Q and H3.3K56R mutants to study the possible function of H3.3K56 acetylation. The K-to-Q substitution mimics a constitutively acetylated lysine, while the K-to-R replacement mimics a constitutively unmodified lysine. We report that cell lines harbouring mutation of H3.3K56R exhibit increased cell death and dramatic morphology changes. Using a Tet-Off inducible system, we found an increased population of polyploid/aneuploid cells and decreased cell viability in H3.3K56R mutant cells. Consistent with these results, the H3.3K56R mutant had compromised H3.3 incorporation into several pericentric and centric heterochromatin regions we tested. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis coupled with label-free quantification revealed that biological processes regulated by the H3.3-associating proteins, whose interaction with H3.3 was markedly increased by H3.3K56Q mutation but decreased by H3.3K56R mutation, include sister chromatid cohesion, mitotic nuclear division, and mitotic nuclear envelope disassembly. These results suggest that H3.3K56 acetylation is crucial for chromosome segregation and cell division in mammals.
PXD019496	33902430	O-GlcNAcylation protein disruption by Thiamet G promotes changes on the GBM U87-MG cells secretome molecular signature. 	O-GlcNAcase activity is necessary for the molecular signature of the Glioblastoma secretome	Glioblastoma secretome, LCMS, O-GlcNAcase activity	Glioblastoma (GBM) is a grade IV glioma highly aggressive and refractory to the therapeutic approaches currently in use. O-GlcNAcylation plays a key role for tumor aggressiveness and progression in different types of cancer; however, experimental evidence of its involvement in GBM are still lacking. Here, we show that O-GlcNAcylation plays a critical role in maintaining the composition of the GBM secretome, whereas inhibition of OGA activity disrupts the intercellular signaling via microvesicles. Using a label-free quantitative proteomics methodology, we identified 51 proteins in the GBM secretome whose abundance was significantly altered by activity inhibition of O-GlcNAcase (iOGA). Among these proteins, we observed that proteins related to proteasome activity and to regulation of immune response in the tumor microenvironment were consistently downregulated in GBM cells upon iOGA. While the proteins IGFBP3, IL-6 and HSPA5 were downregulated in GBM iOGA cells, the protein SQSTM1/p62 was exclusively found in GBM cells under iOGA. These findings were in line with literature evidence on the role of p62/IL-6 signaling axis in suppressing tumor aggressiveness and our experimental evidence showing a decrease in radioresistance potential of these cells. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that OGA activity may regulate the p62 and IL-6 abundance in the GBM secretome. We propose that the assessment of tumor status from the main proteins present in its secretome may contribute to the advancement of diagnostic, prognostic and even therapeutic tools to approach this relevant malignancy.
PXD020692	33902744	Coupled microbiome analyses highlights relative functional roles of bacteria in a bivalve hatchery. 	Washington state shellfish hatchery microbiome	DDA, metagenomics, metaproteomics, microbiome	BACKGROUND: Microbial communities are ubiquitous throughout ecosystems and are commensal with hosts across taxonomic boundaries. Environmental and species-specific microbiomes are instrumental in maintaining ecosystem and host health, respectively. The introduction of pathogenic microbes that shift microbiome community structure can lead to illness and death. Understanding the dynamics of microbiomes across a diversity of environments and hosts will help us to better understand which taxa forecast survival and which forecast mortality events. RESULTS: We characterized the bacterial community microbiome in the water of a commercial shellfish hatchery in Washington state, USA, where the hatchery has been plagued by recurring and unexplained larval mortality events. By applying the complementary methods of metagenomics and metaproteomics we were able to more fully characterize the bacterial taxa in the hatchery at high (pH 8.2) and low (pH 7.1) pH that were metabolically active versus present but not contributing metabolically. There were shifts in the taxonomy and functional profile of the microbiome between pH and over time. Based on detected metagenomic reads and metaproteomic peptide spectral matches, some taxa were more metabolically active than expected based on presence alone (Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria) and some were less metabolically active than expected (e.g., Betaproteobacteria, Cytophagia). There was little correlation between potential and realized metabolic function based on Gene Ontology analysis of detected genes and peptides. CONCLUSION: The complementary methods of metagenomics and metaproteomics contribute to a more full characterization of bacterial taxa that are potentially active versus truly metabolically active and thus impact water quality and inter-trophic relationships.
PXD015124	33905124	The human brain acetylome reveals that decreased acetylation of mitochondrial proteins associates with Alzheimer's disease. 	Human brain global proteome and succinylome analyses	Brain, Succinylation	Metabolic changes that correlate to cognitive changes are well-known in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Metabolism is often linked to functional changes in proteins by post-translational modifications. The importance of the regulation of transcription by acetylation is well documented. Advanced mass spectrometry reveals hundreds of acetylated proteins in multiple tissues, but the acetylome of human brain, its functional significance, and the changes with disease are unknown. Filling this gap is critical for understanding the pathophysiology and development of therapies. To fill this gap, we assessed the human brain acetylome in human brain and its changes with AD. More than 5% of the 4,442 proteins from the human brain global proteome were acetylated. Acetylated proteins were primarily found in the cytosol (148), mitochondria (100), nucleus (91), and plasma membrane (58). The comparison of the brain acetylome in controls to that of patients with AD revealed striking and selective differences in terms of its abundances of acetylated peptides/sites. Acetylation of 18 mitochondrial proteins decreased, while acetylation of two cytosolic proteins, tau and GFAP, increased. Our experiments demonstrate that acetylation at some specific lysine sites alters enzyme function. The results indicate that general activation of de-acetylases (i.e., sirtuins) is not an appropriate therapeutic approach for AD.
PXD063372	33905871	Abnormalities of mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics in neuronal cells from CDKL5 deficiency disorder. 	Abnormalities of mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics in neuronal cells from CDKL5 deficiency disorder	CDKL5, CDKL5 deficiency disorder, Induced pluripotent stem cell, Mitochondria, Oxidative phosphorylation, Proteomics.	CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene, resulting in dysfunctional CDKL5 protein. It predominantly affects females and causes seizures in the first few months of life, ultimately resulting in severe intellectual disability. In the absence of targeted therapies, treatment is currently only symptomatic. CDKL5 is a serine/threonine kinase that is highly expressed in the brain, with a critical role in neuronal development. Evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in CDD is gathering, but has not been studied extensively. We used human patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells with a pathogenic truncating mutation (p.Arg59*) and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-corrected isogenic controls, differentiated into neurons, to investigate the impact of CDKL5 mutation on cellular function. Quantitative proteomics indicated mitochondrial defects in CDKL5 p.Arg59* neurons, and mitochondrial bioenergetics analysis confirmed decreased activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Additionally, mitochondrial trafficking velocity was significantly impaired, and there was a higher percentage of stationary mitochondria. We propose mitochondrial dysfunction is contributing to CDD pathology, and should be a focus for development of targeted treatments for CDD.
PXD022745	33906910	MEK/ERK Signaling in beta-Cells Bifunctionally Regulates beta-Cell Mass and Glucose-Stimulated Insulin Secretion Response to Maintain Glucose Homeostasis. 	Phosphoproteome of mouse pancreatic beta cell	phospho TMT	In diabetic pathology, insufficiency in beta-cell mass, unable to meet peripheral insulin demand, and functional defects of individual beta-cells in production of insulin are often concurrently observed, collectively causing hyperglycemia. Here we show that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is significantly decreased in the islets of db/db mice as well as in those of a cohort of subjects with type 2 diabetes. In mice with abrogation of ERK signaling in pancreatic beta-cells through deletion of Mek1 and Mek2, glucose intolerance aggravates under high-fat diet-feeding conditions due to insufficient insulin production with lower beta-cell proliferation and reduced beta-cell mass, while in individual beta-cells dampening of the number of insulin exocytosis events is observed, with the molecules involved in insulin exocytosis being less phosphorylated. These data reveal bifunctional roles for MEK/ERK signaling in beta-cells for glucose homeostasis, i.e., in regulating beta-cell mass as well as in controlling insulin exocytosis in individual beta-cells, thus providing not only a novel perspective for the understanding of diabetes pathophysiology but also a potential clue for new drug development for diabetes treatment.
PXD024558	33907216	Transcriptomics and metabolomics reveal the adaption of Akkermansia muciniphila to high mucin by regulating energy homeostasis. 	gas chromatography mass spectrometry raw data of A.muciniphila	metabolomics,gas chromatography mass spectrometry,bacteria culture	In gut, Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) probably exerts its probiotic activities by the positive modulation of mucus thickness and gut barrier integrity. However, the potential mechanisms between A. muciniphila and mucin balance have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we cultured the bacterium in a BHI medium containing 0% to 0.5% mucin, and transcriptome and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses were performed. We found that 0.5% (m/v) mucin in a BHI medium induced 1191 microbial genes to be differentially expressed, and 49 metabolites to be changed. The metabolites of sorbose, mannose, 2,7-anhydro-beta-sedoheptulose, fructose, phenylalanine, threonine, lysine, ornithine, asparagine, alanine and glutamic acid were decreased by 0.5% mucin, while the metabolites of leucine, valine and N-acetylneuraminic acid were increased. The association analysis between transcriptome and metabolome revealed that A. muciniphila gave strong responses to energy metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and galactose metabolism pathways to adapt to high mucin in the medium. This finding showed that only when mucin reached a certain concentration in a BHI medium, A. muciniphila could respond to the culture environment significantly at the level of genes and metabolites, and changed its metabolic characteristics by altering the effect on carbohydrates and amino acids.
PXD020689	33908254	Boosting Detection of Low-Abundance Proteins in Thermal Proteome Profiling Experiments by Addition of an Isobaric Trigger Channel to TMT Multiplexes. 	Affinity Purification Trigger with mTPP	AP-MS, TPP	The study of low-abundance proteins is a challenge to discovery-based proteomics. Mass spectrometry (MS) applications, such as thermal proteome profiling (TPP), face specific challenges in the detection of the whole proteome as a consequence of the use of nondenaturing extraction buffers. TPP is a powerful method for the study of protein thermal stability, but quantitative accuracy is highly dependent on consistent detection. Therefore, TPP can be limited in its amenability to study low-abundance proteins that tend to have stochastic or poor detection by MS. To address this challenge, we incorporated an affinity-purified protein complex sample at submolar concentrations as an isobaric trigger channel into a mutant TPP (mTPP) workflow to provide reproducible detection and quantitation of the low-abundance subunits of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) complex. The inclusion of an isobaric protein complex trigger channel increased detection an average of 40x for previously detected subunits and facilitated detection of CPF subunits that were previously below the limit of detection. Importantly, these gains in CPF detection did not cause large changes in melt temperature (Tm) calculations for other unrelated proteins in the samples, with a high positive correlation between Tm estimates in samples with and without isobaric trigger channel addition. Overall, the incorporation of an affinity-purified protein complex as an isobaric trigger channel within a tandem mass tag (TMT) multiplex for mTPP experiments is an effective and reproducible way to gather thermal profiling data on proteins that are not readily detected using the original TPP or mTPP protocols.
PXD019270	33908345	The final step of 40S ribosomal subunit maturation is controlled by a dual key lock. 	Proteomics analysis of human pre-40S ribosomal particles	ribosomal particles	Preventing premature interaction of pre-ribosomes with the translation apparatus is essential for translational accuracy. Hence, the final maturation step releasing functional 40S ribosomal subunits, namely processing of the 18S ribosomal RNA 3' end, is safeguarded by the protein DIM2, which both interacts with the endoribonuclease NOB1 and masks the rRNA cleavage site. To elucidate the control mechanism that unlocks NOB1 activity, we performed cryo-electron microscopy analysis of late human pre-40S particles purified using a catalytically inactive form of the ATPase RIO1. These structures, together with in vivo and in vitro functional analyses, support a model in which ATP-loaded RIO1 cooperates with ribosomal protein RPS26/eS26 to displace DIM2 from the 18S rRNA 3' end, thereby triggering final cleavage by NOB1; release of ADP then leads to RIO1 dissociation from the 40S subunit. This dual key lock mechanism requiring RIO1 and RPS26 guarantees the precise timing of pre-40S particle conversion into translation-competent ribosomal subunits.
PXD021104	33908447	One step carboxyl group isotopic labeling for quantitative analysis of intact N-glycopeptides by mass spectrometry. 	one step carboxyl group isotopic labeling for quantitative analysis of  N-glycopeptide by Mass Spectrometry	intact N-glycopeptides, quantification	Here, we have developed an approach termed methylamine stable isotope labeling (MeSIL) to relatively quantify N-glycopeptides through one step labeling. It is the first time that this approach is applied to measure N-glycopeptide changes in huh7 cells after Zika virus infection and it has been revealed that differentially expressed N-glycopeptides played important roles in virus infection at the glycosylation site-specific level.
PXD022564	33911136	PKR activity modulation by phosphomimetic mutations of serine residues located three aminoacids upstream of double-stranded RNA binding motifs. 	PKR activity modulation by phosphomimetic mutations of serine residues located three aminoacids upstream of double-stranded RNA binding motifs	PKR, autophosphorylation, dsRNA binding, regulation, viral infection	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2), better known as PKR, plays a key role in the response to viral infections and cellular homeostasis by regulating mRNA translation. Upon binding dsRNA, PKR is activated through homodimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation on residues Thr446 and Thr451. In this study, we identified a novel PKR phosphorylation site, Ser6, located 3 amino acids upstream of the first double-stranded RNA binding motif (DRBM1). Another Ser residue occurs in PKR at position 97, the very same position relative to the DRBM2. Ser or Thr residues also occur 3 amino acids upstream DRBMs of other proteins such as ADAR1 or DICER. Phosphoinhibiting mutations (Ser-to-Ala) introduced at Ser6 and Ser97 spontaneously activated PKR. In contrast, phosphomimetic mutations (Ser-to-Asp) inhibited PKR activation following either poly (I:C) transfection or virus infection. These mutations moderately affected dsRNA binding or dimerization, suggesting a model where negative charges occurring at position 6 and 97 tighten the interaction of DRBMs with the kinase domain, thus keeping PKR in an inactive closed conformation even in the presence of dsRNA. This study provides new insights on PKR regulation mechanisms and identifies Ser6 and Ser97 as potential targets to modulate PKR activity for therapeutic purposes.
PXD022583	33912035	Dezocine, An Opioid Analgesic, Exerts Antitumor Effects in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer by Targeting Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase. 	dezocine pull down LC-MSMS in MDA-MB-231 CELLS	MDA-MB-231, ProteomeXchange project tag: Human Proteome Project, breast cancer	Opioids are a potential adjuvant treatment for certain cancers; while they are primarily used to relieve chronic pain, these drugs may also affect cancer progression and recurrence. Dezocine is one opioid commonly used in China, but its effects on cancer cells are unknown. Here, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of dezocine on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, and determined the underlying molecular mechanism. We found that dezocine suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis in TNBC cells. Xenograft models demonstrated the inhibitory effects of dezocine treatment on TNBC tumor growth in vivo. The anticancer effects of dezocine were independent of opioid receptors, which are not highly expressed by normal breast or breast cancer tissues. A pull-down assay and LC-MS/MS analysis indicated that dezocine directly targets NAMPT: computer modeling verified that the free energy of dezocine kinetically bound into the pocket of NAMPT was -17.4 kcal/mol. Consequently, dezocine treatment inhibited NAMPT enzyme activity, resulting in cellular NAD abolishment. We confirmed the dezocine-induced inhibition of cell proliferation by both NAMPT knockdown and upon treatment with the inhibitor FK866. Our results suggest that both dezocine and NAMPT might represent novel therapeutic targets for TNBC.

Characterization of protrusions proteome is crucial for understanding their function. We present a complete step-by-step protocol based on microporous filter-based fractionation of protrusive cellular domains coupled with sample preparation for quantitative proteomics, mass spectrometric data acquisition, and data analysis. This protocol enables purification, quantification, and analysis of the distribution of proteins present in protrusions and cell bodies. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Dermit et al. (2020).
PXD024340	33914801	Dual proteomics of Drosophila melanogaster hemolymph infected with the heritable endosymbiont Spiroplasma poulsonii. 	Drosophila hemolymph infected with Spiroplasma poulsonii	Drosophila, Spiroplasma, endosymbiosis	Insects are frequently infected with heritable bacterial endosymbionts. Endosymbionts have a dramatic impact on their host physiology and evolution. Their tissue distribution is variable with some species being housed intracellularly, some extracellularly and some having a mixed lifestyle. The impact of extracellular endosymbionts on the biofluids they colonize (e.g. insect hemolymph) is however difficult to appreciate because biofluid composition can depend on the contribution of numerous tissues. Here we investigate Drosophila hemolymph proteome changes in response to the infection with the endosymbiont Spiroplasma poulsonii. S. poulsonii inhabits the fly hemolymph and gets vertically transmitted over generations by hijacking the oogenesis in females. Using dual proteomics on infected hemolymph, we uncovered a weak, chronic activation of the Toll immune pathway by S. poulsonii that was previously undetected by transcriptomics-based approaches. Using Drosophila genetics, we also identified candidate proteins putatively involved in controlling S. poulsonii growth. Last, we also provide a deep proteome of S. poulsonii, which, in combination with previously published transcriptomics data, improves our understanding of the post-transcriptional regulations operating in this bacterium.
PXD022690	33915260	Enabling Photoactivated Cross-Linking Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Protein Complexes by Novel MS-Cleavable Cross-Linkers. 	Enabling Photoactivated Cross-linking Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Protein Complexes by Novel MS-cleavable Cross-linkers	26S Proteasome, BSA, Photocross-linking, SDASO	Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) is a powerful tool for studying protein-protein interactions and elucidating architectures of protein complexes. While residue-specific XL-MS studies have been very successful, accessibility of interaction regions nontargetable by specific chemistries remain difficult. Photochemistry has shown great potential in capturing those regions because of nonspecific reactivity, but low yields and high complexities of photocross-linked products have hindered their identification, limiting current studies predominantly to single proteins. Here, we describe the development of three novel MS-cleavable heterobifunctional cross-linkers, namely SDASO (Succinimidyl diazirine sulfoxide), to enable fast and accurate identification of photocross-linked peptides by MS(n). The MS(n)-based workflow allowed SDASO XL-MS analysis of the yeast 26S proteasome, demonstrating the feasibility of photocross-linking of large protein complexes for the first time. Comparative analyses have revealed that SDASO cross-linking is robust and captures interactions complementary to residue-specific reagents, providing the foundation for future applications of photocross-linking in complex XL-MS studies.

However, its effect and mechanism of action are still unknown. The negative effect of SKR on HCT 116 and HT-29 cancer cell lines in hypoxic and normoxic conditions was observed. HCT 116 cells were more responsive to SKR treatment as demonstrated by decreased metabolic activity, cellularity and accumulation of cells in the G1 phase. Moreover, an increasing number of apoptotic cells was observed after treatment with SKR. Based on the LC-MS comparative proteomic data from hypoxia and normoxia (data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD019995), SKR significantly upregulated Death receptor 5 (DR5), which was confirmed by real-time qualitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, multiple changes in the Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-activated cascade were observed. Moreover, the reversion of TRAIL resistance was observed in HCT 116, HT-29 and SW620 cell lines, even in hypoxia, which was linked to the upregulation of DR5. In conclusion, our results propose the use of SKR as a prospective anticancer drug, particularly as an adjuvant to TRAIL-targeting treatment to reverse TRAIL resistance in hypoxia.
PXD022177	33918250	Chronically Elevated Exogenous Glucose Elicits Antipodal Effects on the Proteome Signature of Differentiating Human iPSC-Derived Pancreatic Progenitors. 	Chronically elevated exogenous glucose elicits antipodal effects on the proteome signature of differentiating human pancreatic progenitors	glucose, iPSCs	The past decade revealed that cell identity changes, such as dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation, accompany the insulin-producing beta-cell decay in most diabetes conditions. Mapping and controlling the mechanisms governing these processes is, thus, extremely valuable for managing the disease progression. Extracellular glucose is known to influence cell identity by impacting the redox balance. Here, we use global proteomics and pathway analysis to map the response of differentiating human pancreatic progenitors to chronically increased in vitro glucose levels. We show that exogenous high glucose levels impact different protein subsets in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, regardless of concentration, glucose elicits an antipodal effect on the proteome landscape, inducing both beneficial and detrimental changes in regard to achieving the desired islet cell fingerprint. Furthermore, we identified that only a subgroup of these effects and pathways are regulated by changes in redox balance. Our study highlights a complex effect of exogenous glucose on differentiating pancreas progenitors characterized by a distinct proteome signature.
PXD023801	33918763	Effects of 3FTx Protein Fraction from Naja ashei Venom on the Model and Native Membranes: Recognition and Implications for the Mechanisms of Toxicity. 	Fractionation of Naja ashei venom with Size-exclusion chromatography and identification of proteins in obtained fractions	Naja ashei, Size-exclusion chromatography, shotgun LC-MS/MS, venom	Three-finger toxins are naturally occurring proteins in Elapidae snake venoms. Nowadays, they are gaining popularity because of their therapeutic potential. On the other hand, these proteins may cause undesirable reactions inside the body's cells. A full assessment of the safety of Naja ashei venom components for human cell application is still unknown. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of the exogenous application of three-finger toxins on the cells of monocytes (U-937) and promyelocytes (HL-60), with particular emphasis on the modification of their membranes under the influence of various doses of 3FTx protein fraction (0-120 ng/mL). The fraction exhibiting the highest proportion of 3FTx proteins after size exclusion chromatography (SEC) separation was used in the experiments. The structural response of cell membranes was described on the basis of single-component and multi-component Langmuir monolayers that mimicked the native membranes. The results show that the mechanism of protein-lipid interactions depends on both the presence of lipid polar parts (especially zwitterionic type of lipids) and the degree of membrane saturation (the greatest-for unsaturated lipids). The biochemical indicators reflecting the tested cells (MDA, LDH, cell survival, induction of inflammation, LD50) proved the results that were obtained for the model.
PXD023663	33919525	Mass Spectrometry Imaging as a Tool to Investigate Region Specific Lipid Alterations in Symptomatic Human Carotid Atherosclerotic Plaques. 	Investigation of region specific lipid alterations in symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques using mass spectrometry imaging	MALDI MSI, VSMCs, atherosclerosis, lipids, macrophages, plaque vulnerability	Atherosclerosis is characterized by fatty plaques in large and medium sized arteries. Their rupture can causes thrombi, occlusions of downstream vessels and adverse clinical events. The investigation of atherosclerotic plaques is made difficult by their highly heterogeneous nature. Here we propose a spatially resolved approach based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging to investigate lipids in specific regions of atherosclerotic plaques. The method was applied to a small dataset including symptomatic and asymptomatic human carotid atherosclerosis plaques. Tissue sections of symptomatic and asymptomatic human carotid atherosclerotic plaques were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) of lipids, and adjacent sections analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence. These multimodal datasets were used to compare the lipid profiles of specific histopathological regions within the plaque. The lipid profiles of macrophage-rich regions and intimal vascular smooth muscle cells exhibited the largest changes associated with plaque outcome. Macrophage-rich regions from symptomatic lesions were found to be enriched in sphingomyelins, and intimal vascular smooth muscle cells of symptomatic plaques were enriched in cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. The proposed method enabled the MALDI MSI analysis of specific regions of the atherosclerotic lesion, confirming MALDI MSI as a promising tool for the investigation of histologically heterogeneous atherosclerotic plaques.
PXD024551	33921066	Loss of RET Promotes Mesenchymal Identity in Neuroblastoma Cells. 	Loss of RET promotes mesenchymal identity in neuroblastoma cells	ALK, ALKAL2, EMT, adrenergic, neural differentiation, retinoic acid	Aberrant activation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) drives neuroblastoma (NB). Previous work identified the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) as a downstream target of ALK activity in NB models. We show here that ALK activation in response to ALKAL2 ligand results in the rapid phosphorylation of RET in NB cells, providing additional insight into the contribution of RET to the ALK-driven gene signature in NB. To further address the role of RET in NB, RET knockout (KO) SK-N-AS cells were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. Gene expression analysis of RET KO NB cells identified a reprogramming of NB cells to a mesenchymal (MES) phenotype that was characterized by increased migration and upregulation of the AXL and MNNG HOS transforming gene (MET) RTKs, as well as integrins and extracellular matrix components. Strikingly, the upregulation of AXL in the absence of RET reflects the development timeline observed in the neural crest as progenitor cells undergo differentiation during embryonic development. Together, these findings suggest that a MES phenotype is promoted in mesenchymal NB cells in the absence of RET, reflective of a less differentiated developmental status.
PXD024114	33923941	The Human 2-Cys Peroxiredoxins form Widespread, Cysteine-Dependent- and Isoform-Specific Protein-Protein Interactions. 	The Human 2-Cys Peroxiredoxins Form Widespread, Cysteine-Dependent- And Isoform-Specific Protein-Protein Interactions.	cysteine sulfenic acid, hydrogen peroxide, peroxiredoxin, protein thiol oxidation, redox relay, redox signaling, thiol disulfide exchange	Redox signaling is controlled by the reversible oxidation of cysteine thiols, a post-translational modification triggered by H2O2 acting as a second messenger. However, H2O2 actually reacts poorly with most cysteine thiols and it is not clear how H2O2 discriminates between cysteines to trigger appropriate signaling cascades in the presence of dedicated H2O2 scavengers like peroxiredoxins (PRDXs). It was recently suggested that peroxiredoxins act as peroxidases and facilitate H2O2-dependent oxidation of redox-regulated proteins via disulfide exchange reactions. It is unknown how the peroxiredoxin-based relay model achieves the selective substrate targeting required for adequate cellular signaling. Using a systematic mass-spectrometry-based approach to identify cysteine-dependent interactors of the five human 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, we show that all five human 2-Cys peroxiredoxins can form disulfide-dependent heterodimers with a large set of proteins. Each isoform displays a preference for a subset of disulfide-dependent binding partners, and we explore isoform-specific properties that might underlie this preference. We provide evidence that peroxiredoxin-based redox relays can proceed via two distinct molecular mechanisms. Altogether, our results support the theory that peroxiredoxins could play a role in providing not only reactivity but also selectivity in the transduction of peroxide signals to generate complex cellular signaling responses.
PXD024784	33924085	Proteome Damage Inflicted by Ionizing Radiation: Advancing a Theme in the Research of Miroslav Radman. 	Radiation resistance comparable to natural extremophiles achieved through experimental evolution	D radiodurans, E coli, Oxidation, Radiation	Oxidative proteome damage has been implicated as a major contributor to cell death and aging. Protein damage and aging has been a particular theme of the recent research of Miroslav Radman. However, the study of how cellular proteins are damaged by oxidative processes is still in its infancy. Here we examine oxidative changes in the proteomes of four bacterial populations-wild type E. coli, two isolates from E. coli populations evolved for high levels of ionizing radiation (IR) resistance, and D. radiodurans-immediately following exposure to 3000 Gy of ionizing radiation. By a substantial margin, the most prominent intracellular oxidation events involve hydroxylation of methionine residues. Significant but much less frequent are carbonylation events on tyrosine and dioxidation events on tryptophan. A few proteins are exquisitely sensitive to targeted oxidation events, notably the active site of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in E. coli. Extensive experimental evolution of E. coli for IR resistance has decreased overall proteome sensitivity to oxidation but not to the level seen in D. radiodurans. Many observed oxidation events may reflect aspects of protein structure and/or exposure of protein surfaces to water. Proteins such as GAPDH and possibly Ef-Tu may have an evolved sensitivity to oxidation by H2O2.
PXD023734	33924212	Proteomic and Bioinformatic Investigation of Altered Pathways in Neuroglobin-Deficient Breast Cancer Cells. 	Label-free proteomic analysis of neuroglobin-knockout breast cancer cells	NGB, Neuroglobin, S-Trap, label-free proteomics	Neuroglobin (NGB) is a myoglobin-like monomeric globin that is involved in several processes, displaying a pivotal redox-dependent protective role in neuronal and extra-neuronal cells. NGB remarkably exerts its function upon upregulation by NGB inducers, such as 17beta-estradiol (E2) and H2O2. However, the molecular bases of NGB's functions remain undefined, mainly in non-neuronal cancer cells. Human MCF-7 breast cancer cells with a knocked-out (KO) NGB gene obtained using CRISPR/Cas9 technology were analyzed using shotgun label-free quantitative proteomics in comparison with control cells. The differential proteomics experiments were also performed after treatment with E2, H2O2, and E2 + H2O2. All the runs acquired using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were elaborated within the same MaxQuant analysis, leading to the quantification of 1872 proteins in the global proteomic dataset. Then, a differentially regulated protein dataset was obtained for each specific treatment. After the proteomic study, multiple bioinformatics analyses were performed to highlight unbalanced pathways and processes. Here, we report the proteomic and bioinformatic investigations concerning the effects on cellular processes of NGB deficiency and cell treatments. Globally, the main processes that were affected were related to the response to stress, cytoskeleton dynamics, apoptosis, and mitochondria-driven pathways.
PXD013412	33924830	Proteomic Charting of Imipenem Adaptive Responses in a Highly Carbapenem Resistant Clinical Enterobacter roggenkampii Isolate. 	Proteomics analysis of the Enterobacter cloacae response to imipenem	Enterobacter cloacae, anitbiotic, drug resistance, imipenem	Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Enterobacter cloacae complex are increasingly implicated in difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections, as exemplified by a recently characterized highly carbapenem-resistant clinical Enterobacter roggenkampii isolate with sequence type (ST) 232. While mechanisms of carbapenem resistance are well-understood, little is known about the responses of highly drug-resistant bacteria to these antibiotics. Our present study was therefore aimed at charting the responses of the E. roggenkampii ST232 isolate to the carbapenem imipenem, using a 'stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture' approach for quantitative mass spectrometry. This unveiled diverse responses of E. roggenkampii ST232 to imipenem, especially altered levels of proteins for cell wall biogenesis, central carbon metabolism, respiration, iron-sulfur cluster synthesis, and metal homeostasis. These observations suggest a scenario where imipenem-challenged bacteria reduce metabolic activity to save resources otherwise used for cell wall biogenesis, and to limit formation of detrimental reactive oxygen species at the cytoplasmic membrane due to respiration and Fenton chemistry. We consider these observations important, because knowing the adaptive responses of a highly resistant bacterium of the E. cloacae complex to last-resort antibiotics, such as imipenem, provides a 'sneak preview' into the future development of antibiotic resistance in this emerging group of pathogens.
PXD022542	33925586	Chromatin-Directed Proteomics Identifies ZNF84 as a p53-Independent Regulator of p21 in Genotoxic Stress Response. 	Identification of chromatin-associated proteins occupying the promoter region of CDKN1A	CDKN1A, Chromatin-associated proteins, ZNF84	The p21(WAF1/Cip1) protein, encoded by CDKN1A, plays a vital role in senescence, and its transcriptional control by the tumour suppressor p53 is well-established. However, p21 can also be regulated in a p53-independent manner, by mechanisms that still remain less understood. We aimed to expand the knowledge about p53-independent senescence by looking for novel players involved in CDKN1A regulation. We used a chromatin-directed proteomic approach and identified ZNF84 as a novel regulator of p21 in various p53-deficient cell lines treated with cytostatic dose of doxorubicin. Knock-down of ZNF84, an as-yet un-characterized protein, inhibited p21 gene and protein expression in response to doxorubicin, it attenuated senescence and was associated with enhanced proliferation, indicating that ZNF84-deficiency can favor senescence bypass. ZNF84 deficiency was also associated with transcriptomic changes in genes governing various cancer-relevant processes e.g., mitosis. In cells with ZNF84 knock-down we discovered significantly lower level of H2AX Ser139 phosphorylation (gammaH2AX), which is triggered by DNA double strand breaks. Intriguingly, we observed a reverse correlation between the level of ZNF84 expression and survival rate of colon cancer patients. In conclusion, ZNF84, whose function was previously not recognized, was identified here as a critical p53-independent regulator of senescence, opening possibilities for its targeting in novel therapies of p53-null cancers.
PXD019911	33927199	Decrypting bacterial polyphenol metabolism in an anoxic wetland soil. 	Multi-Omics interrogation of soil microcosms amended with condensed tannins	anoxic response, polyphenols, soil microbiome	Microorganisms play vital roles in modulating organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling in soil ecosystems. The enzyme latch paradigm posits microbial degradation of polyphenols is hindered in anoxic peat leading to polyphenol accumulation, and consequently diminished microbial activity. This model assumes that polyphenols are microbially unavailable under anoxia, a supposition that has not been thoroughly investigated in any soil type. Here, we use anoxic soil reactors amended with and without a chemically defined polyphenol to test this hypothesis, employing metabolomics and genome-resolved metaproteomics to interrogate soil microbial polyphenol metabolism. Challenging the idea that polyphenols are not bioavailable under anoxia, we provide metabolite evidence that polyphenols are depolymerized, resulting in monomer accumulation, followed by the generation of small phenolic degradation products. Further, we show that soil microbiome function is maintained, and possibly enhanced, with polyphenol addition. In summary, this study provides chemical and enzymatic evidence that some soil microbiota can degrade polyphenols under anoxia and subvert the assumed polyphenol lock on soil microbial metabolism.
PXD024220	33927388	The structure of a virus-encoded nucleosome. 	The structure of a virus-encoded nucleosome	Chromatin, Cryo-EM, Evolution, Histones, Marseillevirus, Nucleosomes	Certain large DNA viruses, including those in the Marseilleviridae family, encode histones. Here we show that fused histone pairs Hbeta-Halpha and Hdelta-Hgamma from Marseillevirus are structurally analogous to the eukaryotic histone pairs H2B-H2A and H4-H3. These viral histones form 'forced' heterodimers, and a heterotetramer of four such heterodimers assembles DNA to form structures virtually identical to canonical eukaryotic nucleosomes.
PXD023932	33927411	ABHD17 regulation of plasma membrane palmitoylation and N-Ras-dependent cancer growth. 	ABHD17 regulation of plasma membrane palmitoylation and N-Ras-dependent cancer growth	ABHD17, N-Ras, human acute myeloid leukemia, palmitoylation	Multiple Ras proteins, including N-Ras, depend on a palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle to regulate their subcellular trafficking and oncogenicity. General lipase inhibitors such as Palmostatin M (Palm M) block N-Ras depalmitoylation, but lack specificity and target several enzymes displaying depalmitoylase activity. Here, we describe ABD957, a potent and selective covalent inhibitor of the ABHD17 family of depalmitoylases, and show that this compound impairs N-Ras depalmitoylation in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. ABD957 produced partial effects on N-Ras palmitoylation compared with Palm M, but was much more selective across the proteome, reflecting a plasma membrane-delineated action on dynamically palmitoylated proteins. Finally, ABD957 impaired N-Ras signaling and the growth of NRAS-mutant AML cells in a manner that synergizes with MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition. Our findings uncover a surprisingly restricted role for ABHD17 enzymes as regulators of the N-Ras palmitoylation cycle and suggest that ABHD17 inhibitors may have value as targeted therapies for NRAS-mutant cancers.
PXD023081	33928079	The Pharmacological Effect and Mechanism of Lanthanum Hydroxide on Vascular Calcification Caused by Chronic Renal Failure Hyperphosphatemia. 	The Pharmacological Effect and Mechanism of Lanthanum Hydroxide on Vascular Calcification Caused by Chronic Renal Failure Hyperphosphatemia	Lanthanum hydroxide, chronic renal failure, hyperphosphatemia, mechanism, pharmacological effect, vascular calcification	OBJECTIVE: The present work aimed to explore the efficacy of lanthanum hydroxide in managing the vascular calcification induced by hyperphosphate in chronic renal failure (CRF) as well as the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Rats were randomly allocated to five groups: normal diet control, CKD hyperphosphatemia model, CKD model treated with lanthanum hydroxide, CKD model receiving lanthanum carbonate treatment, together with CKD model receiving calcium carbonate treatment. The serum biochemical and kidney histopathological parameters were analyzed. The aortic vessels were subjected to Von Kossa staining, CT scan and proteomic analysis. In vitro, the calcium content and ALP activity were measured, and RT-PCR (SM22alpha, Runx2, BMP-2, and TRAF6) and Western blot (SM22alpha, Runx2, BMP-2, TRAF6, and NF-kappaB) were performed. RESULTS: In the lanthanum hydroxide group, serum biochemical and kidney histopathological parameters were significantly improved compared with the model group, indicating the efficacy of lanthanum hydroxide in postponing CRF progression and in protecting renal function. In addition, applying lanthanum hydroxide postponed hyperphosphatemia-mediated vascular calcification in CKD. Furthermore, lanthanum hydroxide was found to mitigate vascular calcification via the NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway. For the cultured VSMCs, lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) alleviated phosphate-mediated calcification and suppressed the activation of NF-kappaB as well as osteo-/chondrogenic signal transduction. Lanthanum hydroxide evidently downregulated NF-kappaB, BMP-2, Runx2, and TRAF6 expression. CONCLUSION: Lanthanum hydroxide protects against renal failure and reduces the phosphorus level in serum to postpone vascular calcification progression.
PXD015565	33929514	SUMOylation stabilizes sister kinetochore biorientation to allow timely anaphase. 	SUMOylation regulates the metaphase-anaphase transition by stabilizing sister kinetochore biorientation	Yeast SUMO SMT3 SGO1	During mitosis, sister chromatids attach to microtubules from opposite poles, called biorientation. Sister chromatid cohesion resists microtubule forces, generating tension, which provides the signal that biorientation has occurred. How tension silences the surveillance pathways that prevent cell cycle progression and correct erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments remains unclear. Here we show that SUMOylation dampens error correction to allow stable sister kinetochore biorientation and timely anaphase onset. The Siz1/Siz2 SUMO ligases modify the pericentromere-localized shugoshin (Sgo1) protein before its tension-dependent release from chromatin. Sgo1 SUMOylation reduces its binding to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and weakening of this interaction is important for stable biorientation. Unstable biorientation in SUMO-deficient cells is associated with persistence of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres, and SUMOylation of CPC subunit Bir1 also contributes to timely anaphase onset. We propose that SUMOylation acts in a combinatorial manner to facilitate dismantling of the error correction machinery within pericentromeres and thereby sharpen the metaphase-anaphase transition.
PXD058503	33929778	BoxCar increases the depth and reproducibility of diabetic urinary proteome analysis. 	BoxCar data acquisition mode helps deeply and high efficiency analysis diabetic urinary proteome	BoxCar, DDA, urinary proteome	PURPOSE: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics performs well in high throughput detection of urinary proteins. Nonetheless, protein identification depth and reproducibility remain the challenges in diabetic urinary proteome with high complexity and broad dynamic range, especially for low-abundant proteins. As a new data acquisition strategy, the BoxCar method was reported to benefit for low-abundant protein identification. Whether it is propitious to diabetic samples with high dynamic range proteomes has not been discussed yet. We aimed to apply BoxCar method to diabetic urine sample analysis, and to compare it with standard data dependent acquisition (DDA) method on protein identification in detail. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed seven technical replicates analysis on two urine samples from healthy individuals and diabetic patients to evaluate protein detection of BoxCar and standard DDA methods on single sample. Further comparison of two methods was made on multiple diabetic urine samples. RESULTS: BoxCar could increase over 20% of identified proteins and performed better quantitative reproducibility than standard DDA method either in single or multiple diabetic urinary samples. BoxCar also improved the detection of low-abundant proteins. Functional enrichment analysis of normal albuminuria or microalbuminuria samples indicated that BoxCar acquired more diabetes-related biological information. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The study demonstrates that BoxCar could enhance the depth and reproducibility in diabetic urinary proteome analysis, which provides reference for mass spectrometry approach selection in clinical urinary proteomic research.
PXD021822	33929844	An in vivo Interaction Network of DNA-Repair Proteins: A Snapshot at Double Strand Break Repair in Deinococcus radiodurans. 	Identification of proteins in the interactomes of 4 DNA-repair proteins of Deinococcus radiodurans	Deinococcus radiodurans DNA damage repair	An extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans survives massive DNA damage by efficiently mending hundreds of double strand breaks through homology-dependent DNA repair pathways. Although DNA repair proteins that contribute to its impressive DNA repair capacity are fairly known, interactions among them or with proteins related to other relevant pathways remain unexplored. Here, we report in vivo cross-linking of the interactomes of key DNA repair proteins DdrA, DdrB, RecA, and Ssb (baits) in D. radiodurans cells recovering from gamma irradiation. The protein-protein interactions were systematically investigated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to mass spectrometry. From a total of 399 proteins co-eluted with the baits, we recovered interactions among diverse biological pathways such as DNA repair, transcription, translation, chromosome partitioning, cell division, antioxidation, protein folding/turnover, metabolism, cell wall architecture, membrane transporters, and uncharacterized proteins. Among these, about 80 proteins were relevant to the DNA damage resistance of the organism based on integration of data on inducible expression following DNA damage, radiation sensitive phenotype of deletion mutant, etc. Further, we cloned ORFs of 23 interactors in heterologous E. coli and expressed corresponding proteins with N-terminal His-tag, which were used for pull-down assays. A total of 95 interactions were assayed, in which we confirmed 25 previously unknown binary interactions between the proteins associated with radiation resistance, and 2 known interactions between DdrB and Ssb or DR_1245. Among these, five interactions were positive even under non-stress conditions. The confirmed interactions cover a wide range of biological processes such as DNA repair, negative regulation of cell division, chromosome partitioning, membrane anchorage, etc., and their functional relevance is discussed from the perspective of DNA repair. Overall, the study substantially advances our understanding on the cross-talk between different homology-dependent DNA repair pathways and other relevant biological processes that essentially contribute to the extraordinary DNA damage repair capability of D. radiodurans. The data sets generated and analyzed in this study have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD021822.
PXD021661	33929851	TMTpro Complementary Ion Quantification Increases Plexing and Sensitivity for Accurate Multiplexed Proteomics at the MS2 Level. 	TMTPro Complementary Ion Quantification Increase Plexing and Sensitivity for Accurate Multiplexed Proteomics at the MS2 level	TMTpro, complementary ion quantification, interference-free quantification, multiplexing	Multiplexed proteomics is a powerful tool to assay cell states in health and disease, but accurate quantification of relative protein changes is impaired by interference from co-isolated peptides. Interference can be reduced by using MS3-based quantification, but this reduces sensitivity and requires specialized instrumentation. An alternative approach is quantification by complementary ions, the balancer group-peptide conjugates, which allows accurate and precise multiplexed quantification at the MS2 level and is compatible with most proteomics instruments. However, complementary ions of the popular TMT-tag form inefficiently and multiplexing is limited to five channels. Here, we evaluate and optimize complementary ion quantification for the recently released TMTpro-tag, which increases complementary ion plexing capacity to eight channels (TMTproC). Furthermore, the beneficial fragmentation properties of TMTpro increase sensitivity for TMTproC, resulting in ~65% more proteins quantified compared to TMTpro-MS3 and ~18% more when compared to real-time-search TMTpro-MS3 (RTS-SPS-MS3). TMTproC quantification is more accurate than TMTpro-MS2 and even superior to RTS-SPS-MS3. We provide the software for quantifying TMTproC data as an executable that is compatible with the MaxQuant analysis pipeline. Thus, TMTproC advances multiplexed proteomics data quality and widens access to accurate multiplexed proteomics beyond laboratories with MS3-capable instrumentation.
PXD018831	33930333	The oxidoreductase PYROXD1 uses NAD(P)(+) as an antioxidant to sustain tRNA ligase activity in pre-tRNA splicing and unfolded protein response. 	The oxidoreductase PYROXD1 links human myopathies with pre-tRNA splicing and the unfolded protein response.	flavoprotein, immunoprecipitation	The tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC) splices precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNA), and Xbp1-mRNA during the unfolded protein response (UPR). In aerobic conditions, a cysteine residue bound to two metal ions in its ancient, catalytic subunit RTCB could make the tRNA-LC susceptible to oxidative inactivation. Here, we confirm this hypothesis and reveal a co-evolutionary association between the tRNA-LC and PYROXD1, a conserved and essential oxidoreductase. We reveal that PYROXD1 preserves the activity of the mammalian tRNA-LC in pre-tRNA splicing and UPR. PYROXD1 binds the tRNA-LC in the presence of NAD(P)H and converts RTCB-bound NAD(P)H into NAD(P)(+), a typical oxidative co-enzyme. However, NAD(P)(+) here acts as an antioxidant and protects the tRNA-LC from oxidative inactivation, which is dependent on copper ions. Genetic variants of PYROXD1 that cause human myopathies only partially support tRNA-LC activity. Thus, we establish the tRNA-LC as an oxidation-sensitive metalloenzyme, safeguarded by the flavoprotein PYROXD1 through an unexpected redox mechanism.
PXD023862	33930553	Systemic sclerosis biomarkers detection in the secretome of TGFbeta1-activated primary human lung fibroblasts. 	SSc biomarkers detection in the secretome of TGFbeta1-activated primary human lung fibroblasts.	Fibroblasts, Secretome, TGFbeta	TGFbeta1 is a profibrotic mediator that contributes to a broad spectrum of pathologies, including systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary fibrosis (SSc-PF). However, the secretome of TGFbeta1-stimulated primary human normal lung (NL) fibroblasts has not been well characterized. Using fluorescent 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and differential gel electrophoresis (DIGE) followed by Mass Spectrometry, we identified 37 differentially secreted proteins in the conditioned media of TGFbeta1-activated NL fibroblasts and generated a protein-protein association network of the TGFbeta1 secretome using STRING. Functional enrichment revealed that several biological processes and pathways characteristic of PF were enriched. Additionally, by comparing the TGFbeta1 secretome of NL fibroblasts to proteomic biomarkers from biological fluids of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, we identified 11 overlapping proteins. Together our data validate the TGFbeta1-induced secretome of NL fibroblasts as a valid in vitro model that reflects SSc biomarkers and identify potential therapeutic targets for SSc-PF. SIGNIFICANCE: All proteins secreted by fibroblasts into the extracellular space, representing the secretome, promote cell-to-cell communication as well as tissue homeostasis, immune mechanisms, developmental regulation, proteolysis, development of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell adhesion. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how TGFbeta1, a well-known profibrotic cytokine, modulates the secretome of pulmonary fibroblasts, and how the TGFbeta1-induced secretome resembles biomarkers in SSc. Using functional enrichment analysis, key pathways and hub proteins can be identified and studied as potential therapeutic targets for pulmonary fibrosis.
PXD021473	33931071	FMRP attenuates activity dependent modifications in the mitochondrial proteome. 	Activity-Dependent Mitochondrial Plasticity and Mitoproteome are Dysregulated in Fragile X Syndrome	Autism, FMR1, Fmrp, Fragile X syndrome, Mitochondria, homeostatic plasticity, mitoproteome	Homeostatic plasticity is necessary for the construction and maintenance of functional neuronal networks, but principal molecular mechanisms required for or modified by homeostatic plasticity are not well understood. We recently reported that homeostatic plasticity induced by activity deprivation is dysregulated in cortical neurons from Fragile X Mental Retardation protein (FMRP) knockout mice (Bulow et al. in Cell Rep 26: 1378-1388 e1373, 2019). These findings led us to hypothesize that identifying proteins sensitive to activity deprivation and/or FMRP expression could reveal pathways required for or modified by homeostatic plasticity. Here, we report an unbiased quantitative mass spectrometry used to quantify steady-state proteome changes following chronic activity deprivation in wild type and Fmr1(-/y) cortical neurons. Proteome hits responsive to both activity deprivation and the Fmr1(-/y) genotype were significantly annotated to mitochondria. We found an increased number of mitochondria annotated proteins whose expression was sensitive to activity deprivation in Fmr1(-/y) cortical neurons as compared to wild type neurons. These findings support a novel role of FMRP in attenuating mitochondrial proteome modifications induced by activity deprivation.
PXD024743	33931711	Parallel G-quadruplexes recruit the HSV-1 transcription factor ICP4 to promote viral transcription in herpes virus-infected human cells. 	Parallel G-quadruplexes recruit the HSV-1 transcription factor ICP4 to promote viral transcription in herpes virus-infected human cells	G-quadruplex, HSV-1, ICP4, proteins	G-quadruplexes (G4s) are four-stranded nucleic acid structures abundant at gene promoters. They can adopt several distinctive conformations. G4s have been shown to form in the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) genome during its viral cycle. Here by cross-linking/pull-down assay we identified ICP4, the major HSV-1 transcription factor, as the protein that most efficiently interacts with viral G4s during infection. ICP4 specific and direct binding and unfolding of parallel G4s, including those present in HSV-1 immediate early gene promoters, induced transcription in vitro and in infected cells. This mechanism was also exploited by ICP4 to promote its own transcription. Proximity ligation assay allowed visualization of G4-protein interaction at the single selected G4 in cells. G4 ligands inhibited ICP4 binding to G4s. Our results indicate the existence of a well-defined G4-viral protein network that regulates the productive HSV-1 cycle. They also point to G4s as elements that recruit transcription factors to activate transcription in cells.
PXD017895	33932333	Formation of polarized contractile interfaces by self-organized Toll-8/Cirl GPCR asymmetry. 	Formation of polarized contractile interfaces by self-organized Toll-8/Cirl GPCR asymmetry	Cirl, Drosophila, GPCR, LRR, Myo-II, Toll-8, planar polarity	Interfaces between cells with distinct genetic identities elicit signals to organize local cell behaviors driving tissue morphogenesis. The Drosophila embryonic axis extension requires planar polarized enrichment of myosin-II powering oriented cell intercalations. Myosin-II levels are quantitatively controlled by GPCR signaling, whereas myosin-II polarity requires patterned expression of several Toll receptors. How Toll receptors polarize myosin-II and how this involves GPCRs remain unknown. Here, we report that differential expression of a single Toll receptor, Toll-8, polarizes myosin-II through binding to the adhesion GPCR Cirl/latrophilin. Asymmetric expression of Cirl is sufficient to enrich myosin-II, and Cirl localization is asymmetric at Toll-8 expression boundaries. Exploring the process dynamically, we reveal that Toll-8 and Cirl exhibit mutually dependent planar polarity in response to quantitative differences in Toll-8 expression between neighboring cells. Collectively, we propose that the cell surface protein complex Toll-8/Cirl self-organizes to generate local asymmetric interfaces essential for planar polarization of contractility.
PXD025224	33933138	Serum proteomic profiling in patients with advanced Schistosoma japonicum-induced hepatic fibrosis. 	Serum proteomic profiling in patients with advanced Schistosoma japonicum-induced hepatic fibrosis	Quantitative proteomics, Schistosomiasis-induced hepatic fibrosis	BACKGROUND: Schistosoma japonicum is a parasitic flatworm that is the aetiological agent of human schistosomiasis, an important cause of hepatic fibrosis. Schistosomiasis-induced hepatic fibrosis is a consequence of the highly fibrogenic nature of egg-induced granulomatous lesions, which are the main pathogenic features of schistosomiasis. Although global awareness of the association between schistosomiasis-induced hepatic fibrosis and S. japonicum infection is increasing, little is known about the molecular differences associated with rapid progression to schistosomiasis in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: We systematically used data-independent acquisition (DIA)-based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify differentially expressed proteins in serum samples from patients with advanced S. japonicum-induced hepatic fibrosis. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 1144 proteins, among which 66 were differentially expressed between the healthy control group and the group of patients with advanced S. japonicum-induced hepatic fibrosis stage F2 (SHF-F2) and 214 were differentially expressed between the SHF-F2 and SHF-F4 groups (up- or downregulation of at least 1.5-fold in serum samples). The results also indicated that two selected proteins (C1QA and CFD) are potential biomarkers for distinguishing between patients with SHF-F2 and those with SHF-F4 due to S. japonicum infection. CONCLUSIONS: We provide here the first global proteomic profile of serum samples from patients with advanced S. japonicum-induced hepatic fibrosis. The proteins C1QA and CFD are potential diagnostic markers for patients with SHF-F2 and SHF-F4 due to S. japonicum infection, although further large-scale studies are needed. Our DIA-based quantitative proteomic analysis revealed molecular differences among individuals at different stages of advanced S. japonicum-induced hepatic fibrosis and may provide fundamental information for further detailed investigations.
PXD022864	33933680	TMEM67, TMEM237, and Embigin in Complex With Monocarboxylate Transporter MCT1 Are Unique Components of the Photoreceptor Outer Segment Plasma Membrane. 	Proteomic profiling of plasma membrane proteins from bovine rod photoreceptor outer segments	outer segment, photoreneptor, protein correlation profiling, retina	The outer segment (OS) organelle of vertebrate photoreceptors is a highly specialized cilium evolved to capture light and initiate light response. The plasma membrane which envelopes the OS plays vital and diverse roles in supporting photoreceptor function and health. However, little is known about the identity of its protein constituents, as this membrane cannot be purified to homogeneity. In this study, we used the technique of protein correlation profiling to identify unique OS plasma membrane proteins. To achieve this, we used label-free quantitative MS to compare relative protein abundances in an enriched preparation of the OS plasma membrane with a preparation of total OS membranes. We have found that only five proteins were enriched at the same level as previously validated OS plasma membrane markers. Two of these proteins, TMEM67 and TMEM237, had not been previously assigned to this membrane, and one, embigin, had not been identified in photoreceptors. We further showed that embigin associates with monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 in the OS plasma membrane, facilitating lactate transport through this cellular compartment.
PXD022930	33933681	HLA Class II Presentation Is Specifically Altered at Elevated Temperatures in the B-Lymphoblastic Cell Line JY. 	Temperature induced change of the HLA ligandome	Biology/disease-driven human proteome project (b/d-hpp), EPIC-XS, HLA class I ligandome, HLA class II ligandome, Human immuno-peptidome project (hupo-hipp) (b/d-hpp), ProteomeXchange project tag: Human proteome project, immunopeptidome	Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play critical roles in our adaptive immune system by signaling a cell's health status to the immune system, through presentation of small peptides. Understanding HLA biology is important because of its prominent role in autoimmune diseases and cancer immunotherapy. Although both the HLA class I and class II antigen processing and presentation pathways have been studied extensively, the fundamental rules in HLA class II antigen presentation still remain less understood. To clarify the mechanistic and adaptive differences between the HLA systems, we challenged a B lymphoblastic cell line (JY), widely used as model system in studying antigen presentation, with a high temperature treatment to mimic a "fever-like state", representing one of the most common physiological responses to infection. In the absence of real invading pathogenic peptides to present, we could focus on delineating the intrinsic HLA pathway adaptations in response to high temperature in this particular cell line. Following a three-pronged approach, we performed quantitative analyses of the proteome, the HLA class I ligandome, as well as the HLA class II ligandome. The data reveals that elevated temperature may already prepare these cells for an immune-like response through increased HLA class II presentation capacity and specific release of, from the invariant chain originating, CLIP peptides. Interestingly, at high temperature, prominent changes in the composition of the CLIP repertoire were observed, with enrichment of peptides containing C-terminal extensions beyond the CLIP-core region. Collectively, these illustrate intriguing temperature sensitive adaptations in this B cell line.
PXD014079	33933734	Integrated multi-omics uncovers reliable potential biomarkers and adverse effects of zinc deficiency. 	Integrated multi-omics analysis of zinc deficiency	TMT isobaric labeling, Zinc deficiency	BACKGROUND: Zinc deficiency is a worldwide public health problem. Currently, there are no established biomarkers available for the accurate diagnosis of zinc-deficiency in individuals. Additionally, a comprehensive view of the adverse effects of zinc deficiency is lacking. Our aim was to identify superior biomarkers of zinc deficiency and uncover the adverse effects of zinc deficiency. METHODS: We performed multi-omics analysis using serum proteomics-metabolomics and liver proteomics on zinc-deficient rats to identify candidate biomarkers and reveal the associated adverse effects of zinc deficiency. Secondly, the candidate biomarkers were validated in two zinc-deficient populations and an RCT zinc supplementation trial on a zinc-deficient population. RESULTS: Our integrated multi-omics approach revealed numerous biomarkers (>2000) and glutathione metabolism as the most important changed pathway in zinc deficiency. Three candidate biomarkers from glutathione metabolism were validated in repeated zinc-deficient rats by quantitative analysis. Only glutathione sulfotransferase omega-1 (GSTO1) (among 3 candidate biomarkers) was validated in the two zinc-deficient populations and zinc-supplemented population. Compared with serum zinc, serum GSTO1 yielded a better response to zinc supplementation and a higher correlation coefficient with zinc intake and the AUC value and has the potential for diagnosing zinc deficiency. By integrated multi-omics, we identified both established and novel adverse effects of zinc deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our integrated multi-omics analysis revealed more complete information about zinc deficiency; GSTO1 was found to be a reliable potential biomarker for diagnosis of zinc deficiency.

A novel Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ramulus Mori (Sangzhi) alkaloids ameliorates glucose metabolism accompanied by the modulation of gut microbiota and ileal inflammatory damage in type 2 diabetic KKAy mice	Ramulus Mori (Sangzhi) alkaloids, gut microbiome, ileal damage, inflammation, type 2 diabetes	The novel Traditional Chinese Medicine Ramulus Mori (Sangzhi) alkaloid tablets (SZ-A) are approved by The China National Medical Products Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the extensive pharmacological characteristics and the underlying mechanism are unknown. This study investigated the mechanisms by which SZ-A ameliorates glucose metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model of T2DM. Diabetic KKAy mice were treated intragastrically with SZ-A once daily for 8 weeks, after which glucose levels, lipid metabolism, gut microbiome, systemic inflammatory factors, luminal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (fecal samples), and ileal proteomic changes were evaluated. The ileum tissues were collected, and the effects of SZ-A on pathological inflammatory damage were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of various inflammatory markers, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B p65, were detected in the ileum tissues. SZ-A improved glucose metabolism with enhanced insulin response and elevated glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) nearly 2.7-fold during the glucose tolerance test in diabetic KKAy mice. Gut microbiota analysis demonstrated that SZ-A administration elevated the abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Verrucomicrobia, reduced the levels of Rikenellaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae; and increased the concentrations of fecal acetic and propionic acids compared to the diabetic model group. Additionally, SZ-A markedly improved ileal inflammatory injury and pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration and improved intestinal mucosal barrier function in diabetic KKAy mice. SZ-A also attenuated the levels of circulating endotoxin, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in the mice sera. Collectively, SZ-A ameliorated the overall metabolic profile including glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, which may be associated with an improvement in GLP-1 and insulin secretion, at least in part by modulating the gut microbiome and relieving the degree of ileal and systemic inflammation.
PXD020750	33936100	An Integrated Genomic, Proteomic, and Immunopeptidomic Approach to Discover Treatment-Induced Neoantigens. 	An integrated genomic, proteomic and immunopeptidomic approach to discover treatment-induced neoantigens	MHC, Orbitrap, antigen presentation, interferon gamma	All nucleated mammalian cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins that present peptides on cell surfaces for immune surveillance. These MHC-presented peptides (pMHC) are necessary for directing T-cell responses against cells harboring non-self antigens derived from pathogens or from somatic mutations. Alterations in tumor-specific antigen repertoires - particularly novel MHC presentation of mutation-bearing peptides (neoantigens) - can be potent targets of anti-tumor immune responses. Here we employed an integrated genomic and proteomic antigen discovery strategy aimed at measuring how interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) alters antigen presentation, using a human lymphoma cell line, GRANTA-519. IFN-gamma treatment resulted in 126 differentially expressed proteins (2% of all quantified proteins), which included components of antigen presentation machinery and interferon signaling pathways, and MHC molecules themselves. In addition, several proteasome subunits were found to be modulated, consistent with previous reports of immunoproteasome induction by IFN-gamma exposure. This finding suggests that a modest proteomic response to IFN-gamma could create larger alteration to cells' antigen/epitope repertoires. Accordingly, MHC immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric analysis of eluted peptide repertoires revealed exclusive signatures of IFN-gamma induction, with 951 unique peptides reproducibly presented by MHC-I and 582 presented by MHC-II. Furthermore, an additional set of pMHCs including several candidate neoantigens, distinguished control and the IFN-gamma samples by their altered relative abundances. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to distinguish peptides which are differentially presented due to altered expression from novel peptides resulting from changes in antigen processing. Taken together, these data demonstrate that IFN-gamma can re-shape antigen repertoires by identity and by abundance. Extending this approach to models with greater clinical relevance could help develop strategies by which immunopeptide repertoires are intentionally reshaped to improve endogenous or vaccine-induced anti-tumor immune responses and potentially anti-viral immune responses.
PXD023094	33936167	Three-in-One Simultaneous Extraction of Proteins, Metabolites and Lipids for Multi-Omics. 	Three-in-one simultaneous extraction of proteins, metabolites and lipids for multi-omics	Systemic Acquired Resistance, lipidomics, metabolomics, multi-omics	Elucidation of complex molecular networks requires integrative analysis of molecular features and changes at different levels of information flow and regulation. Accordingly, high throughput functional genomics tools such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics have emerged to provide system-wide investigations. Unfortunately, analysis of different types of biomolecules requires specific sample extraction procedures in combination with specific analytical instrumentation. The most efficient extraction protocols often only cover a restricted type of biomolecules due to their different physicochemical properties. Therefore, several sets/aliquots of samples are needed for extracting different molecules. Here we adapted a biphasic fractionation method to extract proteins, metabolites, and lipids from the same sample (3-in-1) for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) multi-omics. To demonstrate utility of the improved method, we used bacteria-primed Arabidopsis leaves to generate multi-omics datasets from the same sample. In total, we were able to analyze 1849 proteins, 1967 metabolites, and 424 lipid species in single samples. The molecules cover a wide range of biological and molecular processes, and allow quantitative analyses of different molecules and pathways. Our results have shown the clear advantages of the multi-omics method, including sample conservation, high reproducibility, and tight correlation between different types of biomolecules.
PXD014325	33936566	Extracellular vesicles from monocyte/platelet aggregates modulate human atherosclerotic plaque reactivity. 	Proteomic analysis of monocyte-derived Extracellular vesicles	Extracellular vesicles, monocytes	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as key players in different stages of atherosclerosis. Here we provide evidence that EVs released by mixed aggregates of monocytes and platelets in response to TNF-alpha display pro-inflammatory actions on endothelial cells and atherosclerotic plaques. Tempering platelet activation with Iloprost, Aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor impacted quantity and phenotype of EV produced. Proteomics of EVs from cells activated with TNF-alpha alone or in the presence of Iloprost revealed a distinct composition, with interesting hits like annexin-A1 and gelsolin. When added to human atherosclerotic plaque explants, EVs from TNF-alpha stimulated monocytes augmented release of cytokines. In contrast, EVs generated by TNF-alpha together with Iloprost produced minimal plaque activation. Notably, patients with coronary artery disease that required percutaneous coronary intervention had elevated plasma numbers of monocyte, platelet as well as double positive EV subsets. In conclusion, EVs released following monocyte/platelet activation may play a potential role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Whereas attenuating platelet activation modifies EV composition released from monocyte/platelet aggregates, curbing their pro-inflammatory actions may offer therapeutic avenues for the treatment of atherosclerosis.
PXD024039	33937095	Deletion of the ATP2 Gene in Candida albicans Blocks Its Escape From Macrophage Clearance. 	Effect of ATP2 deletion on protein expression in Candida albicans	ATP2 gene, Candida albicans, macrophage	Macrophages provide the first-line defense against invasive fungal infections and, therefore, escape from macrophage becomes the basis for the establishment of Candida albicans invasive infection. Here, we found that deletion of ATP2 (atp2Delta/Delta) in C. albicans resulted in a dramatic decrease from 69.2% (WT) to 1.2% in the escape rate in vitro. The effect of ATP2 on macrophage clearance stands out among the genes currently known to affect clearance. In the normal mice, the atp2Delta/Delta cells were undetectable in major organs 72 h after systemic infection, while WT cells persisted in vivo. However, in the macrophage-depleted mice, atp2Delta/Delta could persist for 72 h at an amount comparable to that at 24 h. Regarding the mechanism, WT cells sustained growth and switched to hyphal form, which was more conducive to escape from macrophages, in media that mimic the glucose-deficient environment in macrophages. In contrast, atp2Delta/Delta cells can remained viable but were unable to complete morphogenesis in these media, resulting in them being trapped within macrophages in the yeast form. Meanwhile, atp2Delta/Delta cells were killed by oxidative stress in alternative carbon sources by 2- to 3-fold more than WT cells. Taken together, ATP2 deletion prevents C. albicans from escaping macrophage clearance, and therefore ATP2 has a functional basis as a drug target that interferes with macrophage clearance.
PXD010014	33937334	Bacterial Hsp90 Facilitates the Degradation of Aggregation-Prone Hsp70-Hsp40 Substrates. 	Bacterial Hsp90 mediates the degradation of aggregation-prone Hsp70-Hsp40 substrates preferentially by the HslUV protease	DnaJ, DnaK, HslV, HtpG, proteostasis	In eukaryotes, the 90-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp90s) are profusely studied chaperones that, together with 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70s), control protein homeostasis. In bacteria, however, the function of Hsp90 (HtpG) and its collaboration with Hsp70 (DnaK) remains poorly characterized. To uncover physiological processes that depend on HtpG and DnaK, we performed comparative quantitative proteomic analyses of insoluble and total protein fractions from unstressed wild-type (WT) Escherichia coli and from knockout mutants DeltadnaKdnaJ (DeltaKJ), DeltahtpG (DeltaG), and DeltadnaKdnaJDeltahtpG (DeltaKJG). Whereas the DeltaG mutant showed no detectable proteomic differences with wild-type, DeltaKJ expressed more chaperones, proteases and ribosomes and expressed dramatically less metabolic and respiratory enzymes. Unexpectedly, we found that the triple mutant DeltaKJG showed higher levels of metabolic and respiratory enzymes than DeltaKJ, suggesting that bacterial Hsp90 mediates the degradation of aggregation-prone Hsp70-Hsp40 substrates. Further in vivo experiments suggest that such Hsp90-mediated degradation possibly occurs through the HslUV protease.
PXD018446	33937930	Exploring the molecular content of CHO exosomes during bioprocessing. 	Isolation and Characterization of small EVs from CHO-K1 cell cultures	CHO, Exosomes, Extracellular vesicles, cell culture	In biopharmaceutical production, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells derived from Cricetulus griseus remain the most commonly used host cell for recombinant protein production, especially antibodies. Over the last decade, in-depth multi-omics characterization of these CHO cells provided data for extensive cell line engineering and corresponding increases in productivity. However, exosomes, extracellular vesicles containing proteins and nucleic acids, are barely researched at all in CHO cells. Exosomes have been proven to be a ubiquitous mediator of intercellular communication and are proposed as new biopharmaceutical format for drug delivery, indicator reflecting host cell condition and anti-apoptotic factor in spent media. Here we provide a brief overview of different separation techniques and subsequently perform a proteome and regulatory, non-coding RNA analysis of exosomes, derived from lab-scale bioreactor cultivations of a CHO-K1 cell line, to lay out reference data for further research in the field. Applying bottom-up orbitrap shotgun proteomics and next-generation small RNA sequencing, we detected 1395 proteins, 144 micro RNA (miRNA), and 914 PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) species differentially across the phases of a batch cultivation process. The exosomal proteome and RNA data are compared with other extracellular fractions and cell lysate, yielding several significantly exosome-enriched species. Graphical Abstract KEY POINTS: * First-time comprehensive protein and miRNA characterization of CHO exosomes. * Isolation protocol and time point of bioprocess strongly affect quality of extracellular vesicles. * CHO-derived exosomes also contain numerous piRNA species of yet unknown function.
PXD022850	33939164	Integrative Multi-omics Analysis to Characterize Human Brain Ischemia. 	Integrative multi-omics analysis to characterize human brain ischemia	Ischemic stroke, integrative analysis, transcriptomics	Stroke is a major cause of death and disability. A better comprehension of stroke pathophysiology is fundamental to reduce its dramatic outcome. The use of high-throughput unbiased omics approaches and the integration of these data might deepen the knowledge of stroke at the molecular level, depicting the interaction between different molecular units. We aimed to identify protein and gene expression changes in the human brain after ischemia through an integrative approach to join the information of both omics analyses. The translational potential of our results was explored in a pilot study with blood samples from ischemic stroke patients. Proteomics and transcriptomics discovery studies were performed in human brain samples from six deceased stroke patients, comparing the infarct core with the corresponding contralateral brain region, unveiling 128 proteins and 2716 genes significantly dysregulated after stroke. Integrative bioinformatics analyses joining both datasets exposed canonical pathways altered in the ischemic area, highlighting the most influential molecules. Among the molecules with the highest fold-change, 28 genes and 9 proteins were selected to be validated in five independent human brain samples using orthogonal techniques. Our results were confirmed for NCDN, RAB3C, ST4A1, DNM1L, A1AG1, A1AT, JAM3, VTDB, ANXA1, ANXA2, and IL8. Finally, circulating levels of the validated proteins were explored in ischemic stroke patients. Fluctuations of A1AG1 and A1AT, both up-regulated in the ischemic brain, were detected in blood along the first week after onset. In summary, our results expand the knowledge of ischemic stroke pathology, revealing key molecules to be further explored as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets.
PXD018596	33939431	Proteomic Profiling of Leukocytes Reveals Dysregulation of Adhesion and Integrin Proteins in Chronic Kidney Disease-Related Atherosclerosis. 	The LC-MS/MS analysis of human leukocytes in atherosclerosis related and non-related to chronic kidney disease	atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, leukocytes	A progressive loss of functional nephrons defines chronic kidney disease (CKD). Complications related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the principal causes of mortality in CKD; however, the acceleration of CVD in CKD remains unresolved. Our study used a complementary proteomic approach to assess mild and advanced CKD patients with different atherosclerosis stages and two groups of patients with different classical CVD progression but without renal dysfunction. We utilized a label-free approach based on LC-MS/MS and functional bioinformatic analyses to profile CKD and CVD leukocyte proteins. We revealed dysregulation of proteins involved in different phases of leukocytes' diapedesis process that is very pronounced in CKD's advanced stage. We also showed an upregulation of apoptosis-related proteins in CKD as compared to CVD. The differential abundance of selected proteins was validated by multiple reaction monitoring, ELISA, Western blotting, and at the mRNA level by ddPCR. An increased rate of apoptosis was then functionally confirmed on the cellular level. Hence, we suggest that the disturbances in leukocyte extravasation proteins may alter cell integrity and trigger cell death, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and microscopy analyses. Our proteomics data set has been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE repository with the data set identifier PXD018596.
PXD023040	33939434	A Simple Optimization Workflow to Enable Precise and Accurate Imputation of Missing Values in Proteomic Data Sets. 	Ovarian cancer imputation analysis, LC MS/MS	DIA-MS, Ovarianc cancer, stroma, tumor	Missing values in proteomic data sets have real consequences on downstream data analysis and reproducibility. Although several imputation methods exist to handle missing values, no single imputation method is best suited for a diverse range of data sets, and no clear strategy exists for evaluating imputation methods for clinical DIA-MS data sets, especially at different levels of protein quantification. To navigate through the different imputation strategies available in the literature, we have established a strategy to assess imputation methods on clinical label-free DIA-MS data sets. We used three DIA-MS data sets with real missing values to evaluate eight imputation methods with multiple parameters at different levels of protein quantification: a dilution series data set, a small pilot data set, and a clinical proteomic data set comparing paired tumor and stroma tissue. We found that imputation methods based on local structures within the data, like local least-squares (LLS) and random forest (RF), worked well in our dilution series data set, whereas imputation methods based on global structures within the data, like BPCA, performed well in the other two data sets. We also found that imputation at the most basic protein quantification level-fragment level-improved accuracy and the number of proteins quantified. With this analytical framework, we quickly and cost-effectively evaluated different imputation methods using two smaller complementary data sets to narrow down to the larger proteomic data set's most accurate methods. This acquisition strategy allowed us to provide reproducible evidence of the accuracy of the imputation method, even in the absence of a ground truth. Overall, this study indicates that the most suitable imputation method relies on the overall structure of the data set and provides an example of an analytic framework that may assist in identifying the most appropriate imputation strategies for the differential analysis of proteins.
PXD023271	33939924	Defining the Caprin-1 Interactome in Unstressed and Stressed Conditions. 	Defining the Caprin-1 interactome in unstressed and stressed conditions	Caprin-1, IP-MS, Protein-protein interactions, Stress Granules	Cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) are dynamic foci containing translationally arrested mRNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that form in response to a variety of cellular stressors. It has been debated that SGs may evolve into cytoplasmic inclusions observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have examined the SG proteome by interrogating the interactome of G3BP1. However, it is widely accepted that multiple baits are required to capture the full SG proteome. To gain further insight into the SG proteome, we employed immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry of endogenous Caprin-1, an RBP implicated in mRNP granules. Overall, we identified 1543 proteins that interact with Caprin-1. Interactors under stressed conditions were primarily annotated to the ribosome, spliceosome, and RNA transport pathways. We validated four Caprin-1 interactors that localized to arsenite-induced SGs: ANKHD1, TALIN-1, GEMIN5, and SNRNP200. We also validated these stress-induced interactions in SH-SY5Y cells and further determined that SNRNP200 also associated with osmotic- and thermal-induced SGs. Finally, we identified SNRNP200 in cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) spinal cord and motor cortex. Collectively, our findings provide the first description of the Caprin-1 protein interactome, identify novel cytoplasmic SG components, and reveal a SG protein in cytoplasmic aggregates in ALS patient neurons. Proteomic data collected in this study are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD023271.
PXD019051	33940111	Activation of the kidney sodium chloride cotransporter by the beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist salbutamol increases blood pressure. 	Acute effects of Salbutamol in Mouse Kidney Distal Convoluted Tubules (mpkDCT) Cells	Beta2-adrenergic receptor, DCT, hypertention, salbutamol	The thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride-cotransporter (NCC) in the kidney distal convoluted tubule (DCT) plays an essential role in sodium and potassium homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that NCC activity is increased by the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol, a drug prevalently used to treat asthma. Relative to beta1-adrenergic receptors, the beta2-adrenergic receptors were greatly enriched in mouse DCT cells. In mice, administration of salbutamol increased NCC phosphorylation (indicating increased activity) within 30 minutes but also caused hypokalemia, which also increases NCC phosphorylation. In ex vivo kidney slices and isolated tubules, salbutamol increased NCC phosphorylation in the pharmacologically relevant range of 0.01-10 muM, an effect observed after 15 minutes and maintained at 60 minutes. Inhibition of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir) 4.1 or the downstream with-no-lysine kinases (WNKs) and STE20/SPS1-related proline alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) pathway greatly attenuated, but did not prevent, salbutamol-induced NCC phosphorylation. Salbutamol increased cAMP in tubules, kidney slices and mpkDCT cells (model of DCT). Phosphoproteomics indicated that protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) was a key upstream regulator of salbutamol effects. A role for PP1 and the PP1 inhibitor 1 (I1) was confirmed in tubules using inhibitors of PP1 or kidney slices from I1 knockout mice. On normal and high salt diets, salbutamol infusion increased systolic blood pressure, but this increase was normalized by thiazide suggesting a role for NCC. Thus, beta2-adrenergic receptor signaling modulates NCC activity via I1/PP1 and WNK-dependent pathways, and chronic salbutamol administration may be a risk factor for hypertension.
PXD023164	33941673	Integrative analysis reveals unique structural and functional features of the Smc5/6 complex. 	Structural and functional analyses identify unique features of the Smc5/6 complex among SMC family of complexes	Cross-linking, Integrative modeling, Smc5/6, XL-MS	Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes are critical chromatin modulators. In eukaryotes, the cohesin and condensin SMC complexes organize chromatin, while the Smc5/6 complex directly regulates DNA replication and repair. The molecular basis for the distinct functions of Smc5/6 is poorly understood. Here, we report an integrative structural study of the budding yeast Smc5/6 holo-complex using electron microscopy, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and computational modeling. We show that the Smc5/6 complex possesses several unique features, while sharing some architectural characteristics with other SMC complexes. In contrast to arm-folded structures of cohesin and condensin, Smc5 and Smc6 arm regions do not fold back on themselves. Instead, these long filamentous regions interact with subunits uniquely acquired by the Smc5/6 complex, namely the Nse2 SUMO ligase and the Nse5/Nse6 subcomplex, with the latter also serving as a linchpin connecting distal parts of the complex. Our 3.0-Aa resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure of the Nse5/Nse6 core further reveals a clasped-hand topology and a dimeric interface important for cell growth. Finally, we provide evidence that Nse5/Nse6 uses its SUMO-binding motifs to contribute to Nse2-mediated sumoylation. Collectively, our integrative study identifies distinct structural features of the Smc5/6 complex and functional cooperation among its coevolved unique subunits.
PXD016794	33941886	Chlorine disinfection facilitates natural transformation through ROS-mediated oxidative stress. 	Proteomic analysis of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 under exposure of disinfectants	Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, SWATH-MS, bacteria, disinfectants	The bacterial infection that involves antimicrobial resistance is a rising global threat to public health. Chlorine-based water disinfection processes can inactivate antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, at the same time, these processes may cause the release of antibiotic resistance genes into the water as free DNA, and consequently increase the risk to disseminate antibiotic resistance via natural transformation. Presently, little is known about the contribution of residual chlorine affecting the transformation of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study investigates whether chloramine and free chlorine promote the transformation of ARGs and how this may occur. We reveal that both chloramine and free chlorine, at practically relevant concentrations, significantly stimulated the transformation of plasmid-encoded ARGs by the recipient Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, by up to a 10-fold increase. The underlying mechanisms underpinning the increased transformations were revealed. Disinfectant exposure induced a series of cell responses, including increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), bacterial membrane damage, ROS-mediated DNA damage, and increased stress response. These effects thus culminated in the enhanced transformation of ARGs. This promoted transformation was observed when exposing disinfectant-pretreated A. baylyi to free plasmid. In contrast, after pretreating free plasmid with disinfectants, the transformation of ARGs decreased due to the damage of plasmid integrity. These findings provide important insight on the roles of disinfectants affecting the horizontal transfer of ARGs, which could be crucial in the management of antibiotic resistance in our water systems.
PXD019967	33945654	Proteomic analyses reveal that immune integrins are major targets for regulation by Membrane-Associated Ring-CH (MARCH) proteins MARCH2, 3, 4 and 9. 	Proteomic analyses reveal that immune integrins are major targets for proteolysis by Membrane-Associated Ring-CH (MARCH) proteins MARCH2, 3, 4 and 9.	Cell Surface, Immune cells, Integrins	MARCH proteins are membrane-associated Ring-CH E3 ubiquitin ligases that dampen immune responses by downregulating cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complexes I and II as well as immune co-stimulatory receptors. We recently showed that MARCH2,3,4 and 9 also downregulate cell surface expression of the inflammatory cytokine receptor for interleukin-6 (IL6Ralpha). Here we use over-expression of these MARCH proteins in the M1 myeloid leukaemia cell line and cell surface proteomic analyses to globally analyse other potential targets of these proteins. A large range of cell surface proteins regulated by more than one MARCH protein in addition to several MARCH protein-specific cell surface targets were identified most of which were downregulated by MARCH expression. Prominent among these were several integrin complexes associated with immune cell homing, adhesion and migration. Integrin alpha4beta1 (VLA4 or VCAM-1 receptor) was downregulated only by MARCH2 and we showed that in MARCH2 knockout mice, Integrin alpha4 was upregulated specifically in mature B-lymphocytes and this was accompanied by decreased numbers of B-cells in the spleen.
PXD019832	33946525	Temporal Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Alterations Associated with Adaptive Response to Hypoxia in Melanoma Cells. 	Temporal proteomic analysis unravels the hypoxic response of melanoma cells	kinome, phosphoproteome, proteasome	Hypoxia is a common feature in various solid tumours, including melanoma. Cancer cells in hypoxic environments are resistant to both chemotherapy and radiation. Hypoxia is also associated with immune suppression. Identification of proteins and pathways that regulate cancer cell survival in hypoxic environments can reveal potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited to improve the efficacy of anticancer therapies. We carried out temporal proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling in melanoma cell lines to identify hypoxia-induced protein expression and phosphorylation changes. By employing a TMT-based quantitative proteomics strategy, we report the identification and quantitation of >7000 proteins and >10,000 phosphosites in melanoma cell lines grown in hypoxia. Proteomics data show metabolic reprogramming as one of the prominent adaptive responses in hypoxia. We identify several novel hypoxia-mediated phosphorylation changes that have not been reported before. They reveal kinase signalling pathways that are potentially involved in modulating cellular response to hypoxia. In addition to known protein expression changes, we identify several novel proteomic alterations associated with adaptive response to hypoxia. We show that cancer cells require the ubiquitin-proteasome system to survive in both normoxia and hypoxia. Inhibition of proteasome activity affects cell survival and may provide a novel therapeutic avenue to target cancer cells in hypoxia. Our study can serve as a valuable resource to pursue novel candidates to target hypoxia in cancers and improve the efficacy of anticancer therapies.
PXD024405	33946530	Protamine Characterization by Top-Down Proteomics: Boosting Proteoform Identification with DBSCAN. 	Protamine characterization by top-down proteomics: Boosting proteoform identification with DBSCAN	Bioinformatics, DBSCAN., Male Infertility, Post-Translational Modifications, Protamine, Proteoform, Sperm, Top Down Proteomics	Protamines replace histones as the main nuclear protein in the sperm cells of many species and play a crucial role in compacting the paternal genome. Human spermatozoa contain protamine 1 (P1) and the family of protamine 2 (P2) proteins. Alterations in protamine PTMs or the P1/P2 ratio may be associated with male infertility. Top-down proteomics enables large-scale analysis of intact proteoforms derived from alternative splicing, missense or nonsense genetic variants or PTMs. In contrast to current gold standard techniques, top-down proteomics permits a more in-depth analysis of protamine PTMs and proteoforms, thereby opening up new perspectives to unravel their impact on male fertility. We report on the analysis of two normozoospermic semen samples by top-down proteomics. We discuss the difficulties encountered with the data analysis and propose solutions as this step is one of the current bottlenecks in top-down proteomics with the bioinformatics tools currently available. Our strategy for the data analysis combines two software packages, ProSight PD (PS) and TopPIC suite (TP), with a clustering algorithm to decipher protamine proteoforms. We identified up to 32 protamine proteoforms at different levels of characterization. This in-depth analysis of the protamine proteoform landscape of normozoospermic individuals represents the first step towards the future study of sperm pathological conditions opening up the potential personalized diagnosis of male infertility.
PXD023525	33946784	Toward an Understanding of the Structural and Mechanistic Aspects of Protein-Protein Interactions in 2-Oxoacid Dehydrogenase Complexes. 	OGDH/DHTKD1-DLST (E1o/E1a- E2o) CL-MS	OGDH, dhtkd1	The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHc) is a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and represents one of the major regulators of mitochondrial metabolism through NADH and reactive oxygen species levels. The OGDHc impacts cell metabolic and cell signaling pathways through the coupling of 2-oxoglutarate metabolism to gene transcription related to tumor cell proliferation and aging. DHTKD1 is a gene encoding 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase (E1a), which functions in the L-lysine degradation pathway. The potentially damaging variants in DHTKD1 have been associated to the (neuro) pathogenesis of several diseases. Evidence was obtained for the formation of a hybrid complex between the OGDHc and E1a, suggesting a potential cross talk between the two metabolic pathways and raising fundamental questions about their assembly. Here we reviewed the recent findings and advances in understanding of protein-protein interactions in OGDHc and 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex (OADHc), an understanding that will create a scaffold to help design approaches to mitigate the effects of diseases associated with dysfunction of the TCA cycle or lysine degradation. A combination of biochemical, biophysical and structural approaches such as chemical cross-linking MS and cryo-EM appears particularly promising to provide vital information for the assembly of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, their function and regulation.
PXD024110	33946813	Proteomic Studies of Primary Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells Derived from Patients Before and during Disease-Stabilizing Treatment Based on All-Trans Retinoic Acid and Valproic Acid. 	Responder and non-responder proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles to ATRA/Valproic acid before treatment	ATRA AML mass spectrometry valcproic acid proteomics phosphoproteomics	All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and valproic acid (VP) have been tried in the treatment of non-promyelocytic variants of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Non-randomized studies suggest that the two drugs can stabilize AML and improve normal peripheral blood cell counts. In this context, we used a proteomic/phosphoproteomic strategy to investigate the in vivo effects of ATRA/VP on human AML cells. Before starting the combined treatment, AML responders showed increased levels of several proteins, especially those involved in neutrophil degranulation/differentiation, M phase regulation and the interconversion of nucleotide di- and triphosphates (i.e., DNA synthesis and binding). Several among the differentially regulated phosphorylation sites reflected differences in the regulation of RNA metabolism and apoptotic events at the same time point. These effects were mainly caused by increased cyclin dependent kinase 1 and 2 (CDK1/2), LIM domain kinase 1 and 2 (LIMK1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7) and protein kinase C delta (PRKCD) activity in responder cells. An extensive effect of in vivo treatment with ATRA/VP was the altered level and phosphorylation of proteins involved in the regulation of transcription/translation/RNA metabolism, especially in non-responders, but the regulation of cell metabolism, immune system and cytoskeletal functions were also affected. Our analysis of serial samples during the first week of treatment suggest that proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling can be used for the early identification of responders to ATRA/VP-based treatment.
PXD024204	33946829	Quantitative Label-Free Comparison of the Metabolic Protein Fraction in Old and Modern Italian Wheat Genotypes by a Shotgun Approach. 	Quantitative Label-free Comparison of the Metabolic Protein Fraction in Old and Modern Wheat Italian Genotypes by a Shotgun Approach	Old and modern wheat genotypes, high-resolution mass spectrometry, label-free quantitation, metabolic proteins, proteome analysis	Wheat represents one of the most important cereals for mankind. However, since wheat proteins are also the causative agent of several adverse reactions, during the last decades, consumers have shown an increasing interest in the old wheat genotypes, which are generally perceived as more "natural" and healthier than the modern ones. Comparison of nutritional value for modern and old wheat genotypes is still controversial, and to evaluate the real impact of these foods on human health comparative experiments involving old and modern genotypes are desirable. The nutritional quality of grain is correlated with its proteomic composition that depends on the interplay between the genetic characteristics of the plant and external factors related to the environment. We report here the label-free shotgun quantitative comparison of the metabolic protein fractions of two old Sicilian landraces (Russello and Timilia) and the modern variety Simeto, from the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 growing seasons. The overall results show that Timilia presents the major differences with respect to the other two genotypes investigated. These differences may be related to different defense mechanisms and some other peculiar properties of these genotypes. On the other hand, our results confirm previous results leading to the conclusion that with respect to a nutritional value evaluation, there is a substantial equivalence between old and modern wheat genotypes.

PXD025688	33946872	Immune-Associated Proteins Are Enriched in Lung Tissue-Derived Extracellular Vesicles during Allergen-Induced Eosinophilic Airway Inflammation. 	Immune-Associated Proteins Are Enriched in Lung Tissue-Derived Extracellular Vesicles during Allergen-Induced Eosinophilic Airway Inflammation	allergy, asthma, exosomes, extracellular vesicles, quantitative proteomics, tandem mass tag, tis-sue-derived extracellular vesicles	Studying the proteomes of tissue-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can lead to the identification of biomarkers of disease and can provide a better understanding of cell-to-cell communication in both healthy and diseased tissue. The aim of this study was to apply our previously established tissue-derived EV isolation protocol to mouse lungs in order to determine the changes in the proteomes of lung tissue-derived EVs during allergen-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation. A mouse model for allergic airway inflammation was used by sensitizing the mice intraperitoneal with ovalbumin (OVA), and one week after the final sensitization, the mice were challenged intranasal with OVA or PBS. The animals were sacrificed 24 h after the final challenge, and their lungs were removed and sliced into smaller pieces that were incubated in culture media with DNase I and Collagenase D for 30 min at 37 degreesC. Vesicles were isolated from the medium by ultracentrifugation and bottom-loaded iodixanol density cushions, and the proteomes were determined using quantitative mass spectrometry. More EVs were present in the lungs of the OVA-challenged mice compared to the PBS-challenged control mice. In total, 4510 proteins were quantified in all samples. Among them, over 1000 proteins were significantly altered (fold change >2), with 614 proteins being increased and 425 proteins being decreased in the EVs from OVA-challenged mice compared to EVs from PBS-challenged animals. The associated cellular components and biological processes were analyzed for the altered EV proteins, and the proteins enriched during allergen-induced airway inflammation were mainly associated with gene ontology (GO) terms related to immune responses. In conclusion, EVs can be isolated from mouse lung tissue, and the EVs' proteomes undergo changes in response to allergen-induced airway inflammation. This suggests that the composition of lung-derived EVs is altered in diseases associated with inflammation of the lung, which may have implications in type-2 driven eosinophilic asthma pathogenesis.
PXD024225	33947439	Role of epigenetics in unicellular to multicellular transition in Dictyostelium. 	Role of Epigenetics in Unicellular to Multicellular Transition in Dictyostelium	epigenetics, histone, multicellularity	BACKGROUND: The evolution of multicellularity is a critical event that remains incompletely understood. We use the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, one of the rare organisms that readily transits back and forth between both unicellular and multicellular stages, to examine the role of epigenetics in regulating multicellularity. RESULTS: While transitioning to multicellular states, patterns of H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation significantly change. By combining transcriptomics, epigenomics, chromatin accessibility, and orthologous gene analyses with other unicellular and multicellular organisms, we identify 52 conserved genes, which are specifically accessible and expressed during multicellular states. We validated that four of these genes, including the H3K27 deacetylase hdaD, are necessary and that an SMC-like gene, smcl1, is sufficient for multicellularity in Dictyostelium. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of epigenetics in reorganizing chromatin architecture to facilitate multicellularity in Dictyostelium discoideum and raise exciting possibilities about the role of epigenetics in the evolution of multicellularity more broadly.
PXD021859	33947818	SIK2 orchestrates actin-dependent host response upon Salmonella infection. 	SIK2-dependent Phosphoproteome and Interactome upon Salmonella infection	Homo sapiens (human)	Salmonella is an intracellular pathogen of a substantial global health concern. In order to identify key players involved in Salmonella infection, we performed a global host phosphoproteome analysis subsequent to bacterial infection. Thereby, we identified the kinase SIK2 as a central component of the host defense machinery upon Salmonella infection. SIK2 depletion favors the escape of bacteria from the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) and impairs Xenophagy, resulting in a hyperproliferative phenotype. Mechanistically, SIK2 associates with actin filaments under basal conditions; however, during bacterial infection, SIK2 is recruited to the SCV together with the elements of the actin polymerization machinery (Arp2/3 complex and Formins). Notably, SIK2 depletion results in a severe pathological cellular actin nucleation and polymerization defect upon Salmonella infection. We propose that SIK2 controls the formation of a protective SCV actin shield shortly after invasion and orchestrates the actin cytoskeleton architecture in its entirety to control an acute Salmonella infection after bacterial invasion.
PXD024004	33947858	Structures of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase condensation domain suggest the basis of substrate selectivity. 	Understanding condensation domain selectivity in non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis: structural characterization of the acceptor bound state	Biocatalysis, Biosynthesis, Condensation domain, Non-ribosomal peptide, Peptidyl carrier protein	Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are important enzymes for the assembly of complex peptide natural products. Within these multi-modular assembly lines, condensation domains perform the central function of chain assembly, typically by forming a peptide bond between two peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)-bound substrates. In this work, we report structural snapshots of a condensation domain in complex with an aminoacyl-PCP acceptor substrate. These structures allow the identification of a mechanism that controls access of acceptor substrates to the active site in condensation domains. The structures of this complex also allow us to demonstrate that condensation domain active sites do not contain a distinct pocket to select the side chain of the acceptor substrate during peptide assembly but that residues within the active site motif can instead serve to tune the selectivity of these central biosynthetic domains.
PXD018744	33947863	Proteomics of resistance to Notch1 inhibition in acute lymphoblastic leukemia reveals targetable kinase signatures. 	Multilayered proteomics uncovers Notch/PKC targeting to overcome resistance to Notch inhibition in acute lymphoblastic leukemia	Notch signaling, PKCdelta, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, T-ALL, drug resistance	Notch1 is a crucial oncogenic driver in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), making it an attractive therapeutic target. However, the success of targeted therapy using gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), small molecules blocking Notch cleavage and subsequent activation, has been limited due to development of resistance, thus restricting its clinical efficacy. Here, we systematically compare GSI resistant and sensitive cell states by quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, using complementary models of resistance, including T-ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models. Our datasets reveal common mechanisms of GSI resistance, including a distinct kinase signature that involves protein kinase C delta. We demonstrate that the PKC inhibitor sotrastaurin enhances the anti-leukemic activity of GSI in PDX models and completely abrogates the development of acquired GSI resistance in vitro. Overall, we highlight the potential of proteomics to dissect alterations in cellular signaling and identify druggable pathways in cancer.
PXD017609	33947960	ST6Gal1 targets the ectodomain of ErbB2 in a site-specific manner and regulates gastric cancer cell sensitivity to trastuzumab. 	ErbB2 Site-Specific alpha2,6-Sialylation Regulates Gastric Cancer Cell Sensitivity to Trastuzumab	Gastric Cancer, Glycoproteomics, Glycosylation, Trastuzumab	The clinical performance of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in the treatment of ErbB2-positive unresectable gastric cancer (GC) is severely hampered by the emergence of molecular resistance. Trastuzumab's target epitope is localized within the extracellular domain of the oncogenic cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) ErbB2, which is known to undergo extensive N-linked glycosylation. However, the site-specific glycan repertoire of ErbB2, as well as the detailed molecular mechanisms through which specific aberrant glycan signatures functionally impact the malignant features of ErbB2-addicted GC cells, including the acquisition of trastuzumab resistance, remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ErbB2 is modified with both alpha2,6- and alpha2,3-sialylated glycan structures in GC clinical specimens. In-depth mass spectrometry-based glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of ErbB2's ectodomain disclosed a site-specific glycosylation profile in GC cells, in which the ST6Gal1 sialyltransferase specifically targets ErbB2 N-glycosylation sites occurring within the receptor's trastuzumab-binding domain. Abrogation of ST6Gal1 expression reshaped the cellular and ErbB2-specific glycomes, expanded the cellular half-life of the ErbB2 receptor, and sensitized ErbB2-dependent GC cells to trastuzumab-induced cytotoxicity through the stabilization of ErbB dimers at the cell membrane, and the decreased activation of both ErbB2 and EGFR RTKs. Overall, our data demonstrates that ST6Gal1-mediated aberrant alpha2,6-sialylation actively tunes the resistance of ErbB2-driven GC cells to trastuzumab.
PXD012125	33948126	Serum-derived extracellular vesicles inhibit osteoclastogenesis in active-phase patients with SAPHO syndrome. 	Quantitative proteomics profiling revealed serum exosomes inhibited the differentiation of osteoclast in SAPHO patients during the active period	SAPHO, exosome, osteoclast, quantitative proteomics	OBJECTIVE: Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder and the underlying pathogenesis is unclear. In this study, 88 SAPHO patients and 118 healthy controls were recruited to investigate the role of serum-derived extracellular vesicles (SEVs) in SAPHO syndrome. METHODS: Quantitative proteomics was applied for SEVs proteome identification, and ELISA and Western blotting was performed to verify the results of mass spectrum data. In vitro osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis assay was used to confirm the effects of SEVs on bone metabolism. RESULTS: Tandem mass tagging-based quantitative proteomic analysis of SAPHO SEVs revealed differential expressed proteins involved in bone metabolism. Of these, serum amyloid A-1 (SAA1) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were upregulated. Higher SAA1 levels in SAPHO patients were confirmed by ELISA. In addition, SAA1 levels were positively correlated with CRP, an inflammatory marker related to the condition of patients. In vitro celluler studies confirmed that SAPHO SEVs inhibited osteoclastogenesis in patients mainly in the active phase of the disease. Further analysis demonstrated that Nucleolin was upregulated in osteoclasts of active-phase patients under SAPHO SEVs stimulation. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified SAA1 as an additional inflammation marker that can potentially assist the diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome, and speculated that Nucleolin is a key regulator of osteoclastogenesis in active-phase patients.
PXD016948	33950315	The iRhom homology domain is indispensable for ADAM17-mediated TNFalpha and EGF receptor ligand release. 	A highly conserved luminal ER exit motif in the pseudoproteases iRhom1 and iRhom2 is indispensable for TNFï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and EGF receptor ligand release	Cell biology, EGF, TNFï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, receptors	Membrane-tethered signalling proteins such as TNFalpha and many EGF receptor ligands undergo shedding by the metalloproteinase ADAM17 to get released. The pseudoproteases iRhom1 and iRhom2 are important for the transport, maturation and activity of ADAM17. Yet, the structural and functional requirements to promote the transport of the iRhom-ADAM17 complex have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Utilising in silico and in vitro methods, we here map the conserved iRhom homology domain (IRHD) and provide first insights into its structure and function. By focusing on iRhom2, we identified different structural and functional factors within the IRHD. We found that the structural integrity of the IRHD is a key factor for ADAM17 binding. In addition, we identified a highly conserved motif within an unstructured region of the IRHD, that, when mutated, restricts the transport of the iRhom-ADAM17 complex through the secretory pathway in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo systems and also increases the half-life of iRhom2 and ADAM17. Furthermore, the disruption of this IRHD motif was also reflected by changes in the yet undescribed interaction profile of iRhom2 with proteins involved in intracellular vesicle transport. Overall, we provide the first insights into the forward trafficking of iRhoms which is critical for TNFalpha and EGF receptor signalling.
PXD024282	33950666	A Semiautomated Paramagnetic Bead-Based Platform for Isobaric Tag Sample Preparation. 	A Semi-automated Paramagnetic Bead-based Platform for Isobaric Tag Sample Preparation	FAIMS, Opentrons, RTS, SP3, TMTpro, automation	The development of streamlined and high-throughput sample processing workflows is important for capitalizing on emerging advances and innovations in mass spectrometry-based applications. While the adaptation of new technologies and improved methodologies is fast paced, automation of upstream sample processing often lags. Here we have developed and implemented a semiautomated paramagnetic bead-based platform for isobaric tag sample preparation. We benchmarked the robot-assisted platform by comparing the protein abundance profiles of six common parental laboratory yeast strains in triplicate TMTpro16-plex experiments against an identical set of experiments in which the samples were manually processed. Both sets of experiments quantified similar numbers of proteins and peptides with good reproducibility. Using these data, we constructed an interactive website to explore the proteome profiles of six yeast strains. We also provide the community with open-source templates for automating routine proteomics workflows on an opentrons OT-2 liquid handler. The robot-assisted platform offers a versatile and affordable option for reproducible sample processing for a wide range of protein profiling applications.
PXD033581	33951178	Unveiling the CHO surfaceome: Identification of cell surface proteins reveals cell aggregation-relevant mechanisms. 	Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell Surfaceome LC-MSMS and mRNA expression analysis	CHO cells, Surfaceome, mRNA expression, signaling pathways	Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) suspension cells are the main production hosts for biopharmaceuticals. For the improvement of production processes, it is essential to understand the interaction between CHO cells and their microenvironment. While the cellular membrane is the crucial surface barrier between the inner and outer cell compartments, the subgroup of cell surface proteins (surfaceome) is of particular interest due to its potential to react to external factors and initiate cell communication and interaction pathways. Therefore, the CHO surfaceome was explored for the first time by enriching exposed N-glycosylated membrane proteins before tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses, identifying a total of 449 surface proteins, including 34 proteins specific for production cells. Functional annotation and classification located most proteins to the cell surface belonging mainly to the protein classes of receptors, enzymes, and transporters. In addition, adhesion molecules as cadherins, integrins, Ig superfamily and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as collagens, laminins, thrombospondin, fibronectin, and tenascin were significantly enriched, which are involved in mechanisms for the formation of cell junctions, cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion as focal adhesions. As cell adhesion and aggregation counteracts scalable production of biopharmaceuticals, experimental validation confirmed differential expression of integrin beta1 (ITGB1) and beta3, CD44, laminin, and fibronectin on the surface of aggregation-prone CHO production cells. The subsequent modulation of the central interaction protein ITGB1 by small interfering RNA knockdown substantially counteracted cell aggregation pointing toward novel engineering routes for aggregation reduction in biopharmaceutical production cells and exemplifying the potential of the surfaceome for specified engineering strategies.
PXD023494	33951267	HSP17.4 mediates salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways in the regulation of resistance to Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in strawberry. 	Hsp17.4 mediates salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways in the regulation of resistance to strawberry anthracnose	HSP17.4, colletotrichum, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, strawberry	In this study, we used virus-mediated gene silencing technology and found that the HSP17.4 gene-silenced cultivar Sweet Charlie plants were more susceptible to Colletotrichum gloeosporioides than the wild-type Sweet Charlie, and the level of infection was even higher than that of the susceptible cultivar Benihopp. The results of differential quantitative proteomics showed that after infection with the pathogen, the expression of the downstream response genes NPR1, TGA, and PR-1 of the salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway was fully up-regulated in the wild-type Sweet Charlie, and the expression of the core transcription factor MYC2 of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway was significantly down-regulated. The expression of the proteins encoded by these genes did not change significantly in the HSP17.4-silenced Sweet Charlie, indicating that the expression of HSP17.4 activated the up-regulation of downstream signals of SA and inhibited the JA signal pathway. The experiments that used SA, methyl jasmonate, and their inhibitors to treat plants provide additional evidence that the antagonism between SA and JA regulates the resistance of strawberry plants to C. gloeosporioides.
PXD020302	33953398	A lysine-cysteine redox switch with an NOS bridge regulates enzyme function. 	Analysis of cross-link on Tranaldolase	oxidation tranaldolase	Disulfide bonds between cysteine residues are important post-translational modifications in proteins that have critical roles for protein structure and stability, as redox-active catalytic groups in enzymes or allosteric redox switches that govern protein function(1-4). In addition to forming disulfide bridges, cysteine residues are susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species, and are thus central not only to the scavenging of these but also to cellular signalling and communication in biological as well as pathological contexts(5,6). Oxidized cysteine species are highly reactive and may form covalent conjugates with, for example, tyrosines in the active sites of some redox enzymes(7,8). However, to our knowledge, regulatory switches with covalent crosslinks other than disulfides have not previously been demonstrated. Here we report the discovery of a covalent crosslink between a cysteine and a lysine residue with a NOS bridge that serves as an allosteric redox switch in the transaldolase enzyme of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the pathogen that causes gonorrhoea. X-ray structure analysis of the protein in the oxidized and reduced state reveals a loaded-spring mechanism that involves a structural relaxation upon redox activation, which is propagated from the allosteric redox switch at the protein surface to the active site in the protein interior. This relaxation leads to a reconfiguration of key catalytic residues and elicits an increase in enzymatic activity of several orders of magnitude. The redox switch is highly conserved in related transaldolases from other members of the Neisseriaceae; for example, it is present in the transaldolase of Neisseria meningitides (a pathogen that is the primary cause of meningitis and septicaemia in children). We surveyed the Protein Data Bank and found that the NOS bridge exists in diverse protein families across all domains of life (including Homo sapiens) and that it is often located at catalytic or regulatory hotspots. Our findings will inform strategies for the design of proteins and peptides, as well as the development of new classes of drugs and antibodies that target the lysine-cysteine redox switch(9,10).
PXD020936	33953667	Galectin-3 Mediated Inflammatory Response Contributes to Neurological Recovery by QiShenYiQi in Subacute Stroke Model. 	Galectin-3 Mediated Inflammatory Response Contributes to Neurological Recovery to QiShenYiQi in Subacute Stroke Model	TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis, brain tissue of rats	Effective therapies for stroke are still limited due to its complex pathological manifestations. QiShenYiQi (QSYQ), a component-based Chinese medicine capable of reducing organ injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion, may offer an alternative option for stroke treatment and post-stroke recovery. Recently, we reported a beneficial effect of QSYQ for acute stroke via modulation of the neuroinflammatory response. However, if QSYQ plays a role in subacute stroke remains unknown. The pharmacological action of QSYQ was investigated in experimental stroke rats which underwent 90 min ischemia and 8 days reperfusion in this study. Neurological and locomotive deficits, cerebral infarction, brain edema, and BBB integrity were assessed. TMT-based quantitative proteomics were performed to identify differentially expressed proteins following QSYQ treatment. Immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis, RT-qPCR, and ELISA were used to validate the proteomics data and to reveal the action mechanisms. Therapeutically, treatment with QSYQ (600 mg/kg) for 7 days significantly improved neurological recovery, attenuated infarct volume and brain edema, and alleviated BBB breakdown in the stroke rats. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that protein galectin-3 and its mediated inflammatory response was closely related to the beneficial effect of QSYQ. Specially, QSYQ (600 mg/kg) markedly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of galectin-3, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in CI/RI brain as well as serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Overall, our findings showed that the effective action of QSYQ against the subacute phase of CI/RI occurs partly via regulating galectin-3 mediated inflammatory reaction.
PXD023576	33953735	Comparative Proteomic Analysis of Sweet Orange Petiole Provides Insights Into the Development of Huanglongbing Symptoms. 	Comparative proteomic analysis of sweet orange petiole	sweet orange petiole	Huanglongbing (HLB) is the most destructive citrus disease worldwide. This is associated with the phloem-limited bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter, and the typical symptom is leaf blotchy mottle. To better understand the biological processes involved in the establishment of HLB disease symptoms, the comparative proteomic analysis was performed to reveal the global protein accumulation profiles in leaf petiole, where there are massive HLB pathogens of Ca. L. asiaticus-infected Newhall sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) plants at the asymptomatic and symptomatic stages compared to their healthy counterpart. Photosynthesis, especially the pathway involved in the photosystem I and II light reactions, was shown to be suppressed throughout the whole Ca. L. asiaticus infection cycle. Also, starch biosynthesis was induced after the symptom-free prodromal period. Many defense-associated proteins were more extensively regulated in the petiole with the symptoms than the ones from healthy plants. The change of salicylic and jasmonic acid levels in different disease stages had a positive correlation with the abundance of phytohormone biosynthesis-related proteins. Moreover, the protein-protein interaction network analysis indicated that an F-type ATPase and an alpha-1,4 glucan phosphorylase were the core nodes in the interactions of differentially accumulated proteins. Our study indicated that the infected citrus plants probably activated the non-unified and lagging enhancement of defense responses against Ca. L. asiaticus at the expense of photosynthesis and contribute to find out the key Ca. L. asiaticus-responsive genes for tolerance and resistance breeding.
PXD024669	33955049	Profiling of intact blood proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry without the need for freezing - Dried serum spots as future clinical tools for patient screening. 	MALDI-MS Profiling of Intact Blood Proteins without the Need for Freezing - Dried Serum Spots as Future Clinical Tools for Patient Screening	Dried Serum Spots, Fast Frozen Serum, MALDI-MS profiling, intact serum protein analysis, serum proteolysis analysis	RATIONALE: To open up new ways for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS)-based patient screening, blood serum is the most preferred specimen because of its richness in patho-physiological information and due to ease of collection. To overcome deleterious freeze/thaw cycles and to reduce high costs for shipping and storage, we sought to develop a procedure which enables MALDI-MS protein profiling of blood serum proteins without the need for serum freezing. METHODS: Blood sera from patients/donors were divided into portions which after pre-incubation were fast frozen. Thawed aliquots were deposited on filter paper discs and air-dried at room temperature. Intact serum proteins were eluted with acid-labile detergent-containing solutions and were desalted by employing a reversed-phase bead system. Purified protein solutions were screened by MALDI-MS using standardized instrument settings. RESULTS: MALDI mass spectra from protein solutions which were eluted from filter paper discs and desalted showed on average 25 strong ion signals (mass range m/z 6000 to 10,000) from intact serum proteins (apolipoproteins, complement proteins, transthyretin and hemoglobin) and from proteolytic processing products. Semi-quantitative analysis of three ion pairs: m/z 6433 and 6631, m/z 8205 and 8916, as well as m/z 9275 and 9422, indicated that the mass spectra from either pre-incubated fast-frozen serum or pre-incubated dried serum spot eluted serum contained the same information on protein composition. CONCLUSIONS: A workflow that avoids the conventional cold-chain and yet enables the investigation of intact serum proteins and/or serum proteolysis products by MALDI-MS profiling was developed. The presented protocol tremendously broadens the clinical application of MALDI-MS and simultaneously allows a reduction in the costs for storage and shipping of serum samples. This will pave the way for clinical screening of patients also in areas with limited access to health care systems, and/or specialized laboratories.
PXD022905	33957313	Tandem mass tag-based proteomics for studying the effects of a biotechnologically produced oyster mushroom against hepatic steatosis in obese Zucker rats. 	oyster mushroom against hepatic steatosis in obese Zucker rats	hepatic steatosis, hepatoprotective, isobaric tandem mass tags, oyster mushroom	Hepatic steatosis is a very common response to liver injury and often attributed to metabolic disorders. Prior studies have demonstrated the efficacy of a biotechnologically produced oyster mushroom (Pleurotus sajor-caju, PSC) in alleviating hepatic steatosis in obese Zucker rats. This study aims to elucidate molecular events underlying the anti-steatotic effects of PSC. Tandem mass tag (TMT) peptide labeling coupled with LC-MS/MS/MS was used to quantify and compare proteins in the livers of lean Zucker rats fed a control diet (LC), obese Zucker rats fed the same control diet (OC) and obese Zucker rats fed the control diet supplemented with 5% PSC (OPSC) for 4 weeks. Using this technique 3128 proteins could be quantified, out of which 108 were differentially abundant between the OPSC and OC group. Functional enrichment analysis of the up-regulated proteins showed that these proteins were mainly involved in metabolic processes, while the down-regulated proteins were involved in inflammatory processes. Results from proteomic analysis were successfully validated for two up-regulated (carbonic anhydrase 3, regucalcin) and two down-regulated (cadherin-17, ceruloplasmin) proteins by means of immunoblotting. SIGNIFICANCE: Valorization of low-grade agricultural waste by edible fungi, such as the mushroom Pleurotus sajor-caju (PSC), represents a promising strategy for the production of protein rich biomass since they boast of a unique enzyme system that has the ability to recover nutrients and energy from biodegradable waste. Herein, we describe the metabolic effects of PSC feeding using a combined quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics approach. In total, 108 proteins were identified to be regulated by PSC feeding in the liver of the obese rats. Complementary usage of a bioinformatics approach allowed us to decipher the mechanisms underlying the recently observed lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory activity of PSC feeding in obese Zucker rats, namely a reduction of fatty acid synthesis, an improvement of hepatoprotective mechanisms and an enhancement of anti-inflammatory effects.
PXD024535	33959028	Application of Proteomics and Metabonomics to Reveal the Molecular Basis of Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizome for Ameliorating Hypothyroidism Instead of Hyperthyroidism. 	Liver proteomics investigations into hypothyroidism treated with Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizome	Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizome, Hypothyroidism	As the treatments of diseases with Chinese herbs are holistic and characterized by multiple components, pathways, and targets, elucidating the efficacy of Chinese herbs in treating diseases, and their molecular basis, requires a comprehensive, network-based approach. In this study, we used a network pharmacology strategy, as well as in vivo proteomics and metabonomics, to reveal the molecular basis by which Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizome (AMR) ameliorates hypothyroidism. Eighteen main compounds from AMR and its fractions (volatile oil fraction, crude polysaccharides fraction, lactones fraction, oligosaccharide fraction, and atractyloside fraction) were identified by HPLC, and their targets were screened using the TCMSP database and Swiss Target Prediction. Disease targets were gathered from the TTD, CTD and TCMSP databases. Hub targets were screened by different plug-ins, such as Bisogene, Merge, and CytoNCA, in Cytoscape 3.7.1 software and analyzed for pathways by the DAVID database. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism pharmacological models were established through systems pharmacology based on proteomic and metabolomic techniques. Finally, AMR and its fractions were able to ameliorate the hypothyroidism model to different degrees, whereas no significant improvements were noted in the hyperthyroidism model. The lactones fraction and the crude polysaccharides fraction were considered the most important components of AMR for ameliorating hypothyroidism. These amelioration effects were achieved through promoting substance and energy metabolism. In sum, the integrative approach used in this study demonstrates how network pharmacology, proteomics, and metabolomics can be used effectively to elucidate the efficacy, molecular basis, and mechanism of action of medicines used in TCM.
PXD022054	33959357	Girding the loins? Direct evidence of the use of a medieval English parchment birthing girdle from biomolecular analysis. 	Medieval birth girdle stains LC-MSMS	Birth, Medieval	In this paper, we describe palaeoproteomic evidence obtained from a stained medieval birth girdle using a previously developed dry non-invasive sampling technique. The parchment birth girdle studied (Wellcome Collection Western MS. 632) was made in England in the late fifteenth century and was thought to be used by pregnant women while giving birth. We were able to extract both human and non-human peptides from the manuscript, including evidence for the use of honey, cereals, ovicaprine milk and legumes. In addition, a large number of human peptides were detected on the birth roll, many of which are found in cervico-vaginal fluid. This suggests that the birth roll was actively used during childbirth. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to extract and analyse non-collagenous peptides from a birth girdle using this sampling method and demonstrates the potential of this type of analysis for stained manuscripts, providing direct biomolecular evidence for active use.
PXD024182	33959516	Modulation of Rumen Microbes Through Extracellular Vesicle Released by the Rumen Fluke Calicophoron daubneyi. 	Modulation of rumen microbes through extracellular vesicle released by the rumen fluke Calicophoron daubneyi	Calicophoron daubneyi, Extracellular vesicles, Gel-based proteomics, Helminth	Parasite derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been proposed to play key roles in the establishment and maintenance of infection. Calicophoron daubneyi is a newly emerging parasite of livestock with many aspects of its underpinning biology yet to be resolved. This research is the first in-depth investigation of EVs released by adult C. daubneyi. EVs were successfully isolated using both differential centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and morphologically characterized though transmission electron microscopy (TEM). EV protein components were characterized using a GeLC approach allowing the elucidation of comprehensive proteomic profiles for both their soluble protein cargo and surface membrane bound proteins yielding a total of 378 soluble proteins identified. Notably, EVs contained Sigma-class GST and cathepsin L and B proteases, which have previously been described in immune modulation and successful establishment of parasitic flatworm infections. SEC purified C. daubneyi EVs were observed to modulate rumen bacterial populations by likely increasing microbial species diversity via antimicrobial activity. This data indicates EVs released from adult C. daubneyi have a role in establishment within the rumen through the regulation of microbial populations offering new routes to control rumen fluke infection and to develop molecular strategies to improve rumen efficiency.
PXD022066	33961790	A regulatory role for CHD4 in maintenance of the spermatogonial stem cell pool. 	A regulatory role for CHD4 in maintenance of the spermatogonial stem cell pool	CHD4, Mi-2beta, Spermatogonial stem cell, self-renewal	Maintenance and self-renewal of the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) population is the cornerstone of male fertility. Here, we have identified a key role for the nucleosome remodeling protein CHD4 in regulating SSC function. Gene expression analyses revealed that CHD4 expression is highly enriched in the SSC population in the mouse testis. Using spermatogonial transplantation techniques it was established that loss of Chd4 expression significantly impairs SSC regenerative capacity, causing a ~50% reduction in colonization of recipient testes. An scRNA-seq comparison revealed reduced expression of "self-renewal" genes following Chd4 knockdown, along with increased expression of signature progenitor genes. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that CHD4 regulates gene expression in spermatogonia not only through its traditional association with the remodeling complex NuRD, but also via interaction with the GDNF-responsive transcription factor SALL4. Cumulatively, the results of this study depict a previously unappreciated role for CHD4 in controlling fate decisions in the spermatogonial pool.
PXD015660	33962942	Alternative glycosylation controls endoplasmic reticulum dynamics and tubular extension in mammalian cells. 	Proteome analysis of HeLa cells knocked down for EXT1 expression	Orbitrap, SILAC, glycosylation, microsomes	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a central eukaryotic organelle with a tubular network made of hairpin proteins linked by hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate nucleotides. Among posttranslational modifications initiated at the ER level, glycosylation is the most common reaction. However, our understanding of the impact of glycosylation on the ER structure remains unclear. Here, we show that exostosin-1 (EXT1) glycosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in N-glycosylation, is a key regulator of ER morphology and dynamics. We have integrated multiomics and superresolution imaging to characterize the broad effect of EXT1 inactivation, including the ER shape-dynamics-function relationships in mammalian cells. We have observed that inactivating EXT1 induces cell enlargement and enhances metabolic switches such as protein secretion. In particular, suppressing EXT1 in mouse thymocytes causes developmental dysfunctions associated with the ER network extension. Last, our data illuminate the physical and functional aspects of the ER proteome-glycome-lipidome structure axis, with implications in biotechnology and medicine.
PXD021990	33963260	Collagen fiber regulation in human pediatric aortic valve development and disease. 	Collagen Fiber Regulation in Human Pediatric Aortic Valve Development and Disease	Aortic Valve Stenosis, Collagen	Congenital aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) affects up to 10% of the world population without medical therapies to treat the disease. New molecular targets are continually being sought that can halt CAVS progression. Collagen deregulation is a hallmark of CAVS yet remains mostly undefined. Here, histological studies were paired with high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) collagen-targeting proteomics to investigate collagen fiber production with collagen regulation associated with human AV development and pediatric end-stage CAVS (pCAVS). Histological studies identified collagen fiber realignment and unique regions of high-density collagen in pCAVS. Proteomic analysis reported specific collagen peptides are modified by hydroxylated prolines (HYP), a post-translational modification critical to stabilizing the collagen triple helix. Quantitative data analysis reported significant regulation of collagen HYP sites across patient categories. Non-collagen type ECM proteins identified (26 of the 44 total proteins) have direct interactions in collagen synthesis, regulation, or modification. Network analysis identified BAMBI (BMP and Activin Membrane Bound Inhibitor) as a potential upstream regulator of the collagen interactome. This is the first study to detail the collagen types and HYP modifications associated with human AV development and pCAVS. We anticipate that this study will inform new therapeutic avenues that inhibit valvular degradation in pCAVS and engineered options for valve replacement.
PXD024631	33963617	Striated muscle activator of Rho signalling (STARS) overexpression in the mdx mouse enhances muscle functional capacity and regulates the actin cytoskeleton and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. 	STARS overexpression in the mdx mouse tibialis anterior muscle increases maximal isometric force production and regulates members of the keratin, NRF2 and OXPHOS pathways	NRF2, OXPHOS, STARS, adeno-associated virus, keratin, mdx mouse, muscular dystrophy, skeletal muscle	NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? Striated muscle activator of rho signalling (STARS) is an actin-binding protein that regulates transcriptional pathways controlling muscle function, growth and myogenesis, processes that are impaired in dystrophic muscle: what is the regulation of the STARS pathway in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)? What is the main finding and its importance? Members of the STARS signalling pathway are reduced in the quadriceps of patients with DMD and in mouse models of muscular dystrophy. Overexpression of STARS in the dystrophic deficient mdx mouse model increased maximal isometric specific force and upregulated members of the actin cytoskeleton and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Regulating STARS may be a therapeutic approach to enhance muscle health. ABSTRACT: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterised by impaired cytoskeleton organisation, cytosolic calcium handling, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. This results in progressive muscle damage, wasting and weakness and premature death. The striated muscle activator of rho signalling (STARS) is an actin-binding protein that activates the myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTFA)/serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional pathway, a pathway regulating cytoskeletal structure and muscle function, growth and repair. We investigated the regulation of the STARS pathway in the quadriceps muscle from patients with DMD and in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle from the dystrophin-deficient mdx and dko (utrophin and dystrophin null) mice. Protein levels of STARS, SRF and RHOA were reduced in patients with DMD. STARS, SRF and MRTFA mRNA levels were also decreased in DMD muscle, while Stars mRNA levels were decreased in the mdx mice and Srf and Mrtfa mRNAs decreased in the dko mice. Overexpressing human STARS (hSTARS) in the TA muscles of mdx mice increased maximal isometric specific force by 13% (P < 0.05). This was not associated with changes in muscle mass, fibre cross-sectional area, fibre type, centralised nuclei or collagen deposition. Proteomics screening followed by pathway enrichment analysis identified that hSTARS overexpression resulted in 31 upregulated and 22 downregulated proteins belonging to the actin cytoskeleton and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. These pathways are impaired in dystrophic muscle and regulate processes that are vital for muscle function. Increasing the STARS protein in dystrophic muscle improves muscle force production, potentially via synergistic regulation of cytoskeletal structure and energy production.
PXD021942	33963872	NSMF promotes the replication stress-induced DNA damage response for genome maintenance. 	NSMF promotes the replication stress-induced DNA damage response for genome maintenance	ATR, CDC5L, RPA2, replication fork	Proper activation of DNA repair pathways in response to DNA replication stress is critical for maintaining genomic integrity. Due to the complex nature of the replication fork (RF), problems at the RF require multiple proteins, some of which remain unidentified, for resolution. In this study, we identified the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor synaptonuclear signaling and neuronal migration factor (NSMF) as a key replication stress response factor that is important for ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) activation. NSMF localizes rapidly to stalled RFs and acts as a scaffold to modulate replication protein A (RPA) complex formation with cell division cycle 5-like (CDC5L) and ATR/ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP). Depletion of NSMF compromised phosphorylation and ubiquitination of RPA2 and the ATR signaling cascade, resulting in genomic instability at RFs under DNA replication stress. Consistently, NSMF knockout mice exhibited increased genomic instability and hypersensitivity to genotoxic stress. NSMF deficiency in human and mouse cells also caused increased chromosomal instability. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that NSMF regulates the ATR pathway and the replication stress response network for genome maintenance and cell survival.
PXD019253	33965424	Protein interaction patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana leaf mitochondria change in dependence to light. 	Protein Interaction Patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana Leaf Mitochondria Change in Response to Illumination	OXPHOS, TCA-cycle, complexome profiling, diurnal cycle, plant mitochondria, protein complexes	Mitochondrial biology is underpinned by the presence and activity of large protein assemblies participating in the organelle-located steps of respiration, TCA-cycle, glycine oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. While the enzymatic roles of these complexes are undisputed, little is known about the interactions of the subunits beyond their presence in these protein complexes and their functions in regulating mitochondrial metabolism. By applying one of the most important regulatory cues for plant metabolism, the presence or absence of light, we here assess changes in the composition and molecular mass of protein assemblies involved in NADH-production in the mitochondrial matrix and in oxidative phosphorylation by employing a differential complexome profiling strategy. Covering a mass up to 25 MDa, we demonstrate dynamic associations of matrix enzymes and of components involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The data presented here form the basis for future studies aiming to advance our understanding of the role of protein:protein interactions in regulating plant mitochondrial functions.
PXD024443	33968084	Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis Reveals Dendritic Cell- Specific STAT Signaling After alpha2-3-Linked Sialic Acid Ligand Binding. 	Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis reveals dendritic cell- specific STAT signaling after alpha2-3-linked sialic acid ligand binding	Dendritic cells, JAK-STAT, LPS, MoDC, label-free, phosphoproteomics, single-shot, alpha2-3 sialic acid	Dendritic cells (DCs) are key initiators of the adaptive immunity, and upon recognition of pathogens are able to skew T cell differentiation to elicit appropriate responses. DCs possess this extraordinary capacity to discern external signals using receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. These can be glycan-binding receptors that recognize carbohydrate structures on pathogens or pathogen-associated patterns that additionally bind receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). This study explores the early signaling events in DCs upon binding of alpha2-3 sialic acid (alpha2-3sia) that are recognized by Immune inhibitory Sialic acid binding immunoglobulin type lectins. alpha2-3sias are commonly found on bacteria, e.g. Group B Streptococcus, but can also be expressed by tumor cells. We investigated whether alpha2-3sia conjugated to a dendrimeric core alters DC signaling properties. Through phosphoproteomic analysis, we found differential signaling profiles in DCs after alpha2-3sia binding alone or in combination with LPS/TLR4 co-stimulation. alpha2-3sia was able to modulate the TLR4 signaling cascade, resulting in 109 altered phosphoproteins. These phosphoproteins were annotated to seven biological processes, including the regulation of the IL-12 cytokine pathway. Secretion of IL-10, the inhibitory regulator of IL-12 production, by DCs was found upregulated after overnight stimulation with the alpha2-3sia dendrimer. Analysis of kinase activity revealed altered signatures in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. PhosphoSTAT3 (Ser727) and phosphoSTAT5A (Ser780), involved in the regulation of the IL-12 pathway, were both downregulated. Flow cytometric quantification indeed revealed de- phosphorylation over time upon stimulation with alpha2-3sia, but no alpha2-6sia. Inhibition of both STAT3 and -5A in moDCs resulted in a similar cytokine secretion profile as alpha-3sia triggered DCs. Conclusively, this study revealed a specific alteration of the JAK-STAT pathway in DCs upon simultaneous alpha2-3sia and LPS stimulation, altering the IL10:IL-12 cytokine secretion profile associated with reduction of inflammation. Targeted control of the STAT phosphorylation status is therefore an interesting lead for the abrogation of immune escape that bacteria or tumors impose on the host.
PXD023347	33968925	USP36-Mediated Deubiquitination of DOCK4 Contributes to the Diabetic Renal Tubular Epithelial Cell Injury via Wnt/beta-Catenin Signaling Pathway. 	USP36-mediated deubiquitination of DOCK4 contributes to the diabetic renal tubular epithelial cell injury via Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway	Wnt/beta-catenin, dedicator of cytokinesis 4, deubiquitination, diabetic kidney disease, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, ubiquitin specific proteases 36	Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has become the leading cause of end-stage renal disease but the efficacy of current treatment remains unsatisfactory. The pathogenesis of DKD needs a more in-depth research. Ubiquitin specific proteases 36 (USP36), a member of deubiquitinating enzymes family, has aroused wide concerns for its role in deubiquitinating and stabilizing target proteins. Nevertheless, the role of USP36 in diabetes has never been reported yet. Herein, we identified an increased expression of USP36 both in vitro and in vivo in diabetic renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), and its overexpression is related to the enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Further investigation into the mechanisms proved that USP36 could directly bind to and mediate the deubiquitination of dedicator of cytokinesis 4 (DOCK4), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that could activate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and induce EMT. Our study revealed a new mechanism that USP36 participates in the pathogenesis of DKD, and provided potential intervening targets accordingly.
PXD024507	33968945	Targeting RFWD2 as an Effective Strategy to Inhibit Cellular Proliferation and Overcome Drug Resistance to Proteasome Inhibitor in Multiple Myeloma. 	MS Analysis Reveals the Potential Signaling Pathway for RFWD2 Function in multiple myeloma	RFWD2, multiple myeloma	The potential to overcome resistance to proteasome inhibitors is greatly related with ubiquitin-proteasome system during multiple myeloma (MM) treatment process. The constitutive photomorphogenic 1 (RFWD2), referred to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been identified as an oncogene in multiple cancers, yet important questions on the role of RFWD2 in MM biology and treatment remain unclear. Here we demonstrated that MM patients with elevated RFWD2 expression achieved adverse outcome and drug resistance by analyzing gene expression profiling. Moreover, we proved that RFWD2 participated in the process of cell cycle, cell growth and death in MM by mass spectrometry analysis. In vitro study indicated that inducible knockdown of RFWD2 hindered cellular growth and triggered apoptosis in MM cells. Mechanism study revealed that RFWD2 controlled MM cellular proliferation via regulating the degradation of P27 rather than P53. Further exploration unveiled that RFWD2 meditated P27 ubiquitination via interacting with RCHY1, which served as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of P27. Finally, in vivo study illustrated that blocking RFWD2 in BTZ-resistant MM cells overcame the drug resistance in a myeloma xenograft mouse model. Taken together, these findings provide compelling evidence for prompting that targeting RFWD2 may be an effective strategy to inhibit cellular proliferation and overcome drug resistance to proteasome inhibitor in MM.
PXD024664	33970928	Isolation of the Buchnera aphidicola flagellum basal body complexes from the Buchnera membrane. 	Isolation of the Buchnera aphidicola flagellum basal body complexes from the Buchnera membrane	Buchnera, basal body, endosymbiont, flagella	Buchnera aphidicola is an intracellular bacterial symbiont of aphids and maintains a small genome of only 600 kbps. Buchnera is thought to maintain only genes relevant to the symbiosis with its aphid host. Curiously, the Buchnera genome contains gene clusters coding for flagellum basal body structural proteins and for flagellum type III export machinery. These structures have been shown to be highly expressed and present in large numbers on Buchnera cells. No recognizable pathogenicity factors or secreted proteins have been identified in the Buchnera genome, and the relevance of this protein complex to the symbiosis is unknown. Here, we show isolation of Buchnera flagellum basal body proteins from the cellular membrane of Buchnera, confirming the enrichment of flagellum basal body proteins relative to other proteins in the Buchnera proteome. This will facilitate studies of the structure and function of the Buchnera flagellum structure, and its role in this model symbiosis.
PXD025440	33971198	Cardio- and reno-protective effects of dipeptidyl peptidase III in diabetic mice. 	Exploration of peptides that are increased in the plasma of diabetic mice and are the substrate of dipeptidyl peptidase III	diabetes mellitus, peptidase, peptide, plasma	Diabetes mellitus (DM) causes injury to tissues and organs, including to the heart and kidney, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Thus, novel potential therapeutics are continuously required to minimize DM-related organ damage. We have previously shown that dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPPIII) has beneficial roles in a hypertensive mouse model, but it is unknown whether DPPIII has any effects on DM. In this study, we found that intravenous administration of recombinant DPPIII in diabetic db/db mice for 8 weeks suppressed the DM-induced cardiac diastolic dysfunctions and renal injury without alteration of the blood glucose level. This treatment inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis in the heart and blocked the increase in albuminuria by attenuating the disruption of the glomerular microvasculature and inhibiting the effacement of podocyte foot processes in the kidney. The beneficial role of DPPIII was, at least in part, mediated by the cleavage of a cytotoxic peptide, named Peptide 2, which was increased in db/db mice compared with normal mice. This peptide consisted of nine amino acids, was a digested fragment of complement component 3 (C3), and had an anaphylatoxin-like effect determined by the Miles assay and chemoattractant analysis. The effect was dependent on its interaction with the C3a receptor and protein kinase C-mediated RhoA activation downstream of the receptor in endothelial cells. In conclusion, DPPIII plays a protective role in the heart and kidney in a DM animal model through cleavage of a peptide that is a part of C3.
PXD005850	33971369	The Expression of NTAL and Its Protein Interactors Is Associated With Clinical Outcomes in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. 	Identification of NTAL protein interactors	Interactors, Leukemia, NTAL	Non-T cell activation linker (NTAL) membrane protein depletion from lipid rafts by alkylphospholipids or downregulation by shRNA knockdown decreases cell viability through regulation of the Akt/PI3K pathway in mantle cell lymphoma and acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Here, we confirmed that the knockdown of NTAL in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines was associated with decreased cell proliferation and survival. Similarly, a xenograft model using AML cells transduced with NTAL-shRNA and transplanted into immunodeficient mice led to a 1.8-fold decrease in tumor burden. Using immunoprecipitation, LC-MS/MS analysis, and label-free protein quantification, we identified interactors of NTAL in two AML cell lines. By evaluating the gene expression signatures of the NTAL protein interactors using the PREdiction of Clinical Outcomes from Genomic Profiles database, we found that 12 NTAL interactors could predict overall survival in AML, in at least two independent cohorts. In addition, patients with AML exhibiting a high expression of NTAL and its interactors were associated with a leukemic granulocyte-macrophage progenitor-like state. Taken together, our data provide evidence that NTAL and its protein interactors are relevant to AML cell proliferation and survival and represent potential therapeutic targets for granulocyte-macrophage progenitor-like leukemias.
PXD022667	33972534	Genoppi is an open-source software for robust and standardized integration of proteomic and genetic data. 	Genoppi: an open-source software for robust and standardized integration of proteomic and genetic data	BCL2, MDM2, PTEN, TDP-43, endogenous IP-MS, label-free quantification, neuron and cancer cells, protein-protein interactions	Combining genetic and cell-type-specific proteomic datasets can generate biological insights and therapeutic hypotheses, but a technical and statistical framework for such analyses is lacking. Here, we present an open-source computational tool called Genoppi (lagelab.org/genoppi) that enables robust, standardized, and intuitive integration of quantitative proteomic results with genetic data. We use Genoppi to analyze 16 cell-type-specific protein interaction datasets of four proteins (BCL2, TDP-43, MDM2, PTEN) involved in cancer and neurological disease. Through systematic quality control of the data and integration with published protein interactions, we show a general pattern of both cell-type-independent and cell-type-specific interactions across three cancer cell types and one human iPSC-derived neuronal cell type. Furthermore, through the integration of proteomic and genetic datasets in Genoppi, our results suggest that the neuron-specific interactions of these proteins are mediating their genetic involvement in neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, our analyses suggest that human iPSC-derived neurons are a relevant model system for studying the involvement of BCL2 and TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PXD025151	33973768	Automated Intact Glycopeptide Enrichment Method Facilitating Highly Reproducible Analysis of Serum Site-Specific N-Glycoproteome. 	An automated intact glycopeptide enrichment method for serum site-specific N-glycoproteomic analysis	intact glycopeptide, serum N-glycoproteome	Bottom-up proteomics has been increasingly applied in clinical research to study the disease pathophysiology and to discover disease biomarkers. However, glycoproteomic analysis always requires tedious experimental steps for intact glycopeptide enrichment, which has been the technique bottleneck for large-scale analysis of clinical samples. Herein, we developed an automated glycopeptide enrichment method for the analysis of serum site-specific N-glycoproteome. This automated method allowed for processing one sample within 20 min. It showed higher enrichment specificity, more intact glycopeptide identifications, and better quantitative reproducibility than the traditional manual method using microtip enrichment devices. We further applied this method to investigate the serum site-specific N-glycosylation changes between four patients with pancreatic cancer and seven healthy controls. The principal component analysis of intact N-glycopeptides showed good clustering across cancer and normal groups. Furthermore, we found that the site-specific glycoforms, monofucosylated and nonsialylated oligosaccharides, on IgG1 site 180 expressed a significant decrease in pancreatic cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Together, the automated method is a powerful tool for site-specific N-glycoproteomic analysis of complex biological samples, and it has great potential for clinical utilities.
PXD021899	33974846	Systematic functional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 proteins uncovers viral innate immune antagonists and remaining vulnerabilities. 	Analysis of innate immune antagonism by SARS-CoV-2 reveals options for therapeutic immune modulation and differences to SARS-CoV	Innate Immune system, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SARS-CoV2	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evades most innate immune responses but may still be vulnerable to some. Here, we systematically analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on interferon (IFN) responses and autophagy. We show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergize to counteract anti-viral immune responses. For example, Nsp14 targets the type I IFN receptor for lysosomal degradation, ORF3a prevents fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, and ORF7a interferes with autophagosome acidification. Most activities are evolutionarily conserved. However, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 antagonizes IFN signaling less efficiently than the orthologs of closely related RaTG13-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 proteins counteract autophagy and type I IFN more efficiently than type II or III IFN signaling, and infection experiments confirm potent inhibition by IFN-gamma and -lambda1. Our results define the repertoire and selected mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 innate immune antagonists but also reveal vulnerability to type II and III IFN that may help to develop safe and effective anti-viral approaches.
PXD024117	33975020	The C-Mannosylome of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Implies a Role for ADAMTS16 C-Mannosylation in Eye Development. 	Endogenous THBS1 is C-mannosylated by human induced pluripotent stem cells.	C-Mannosylation, TSR, hiPSC, thrombospondin	C-mannosylation is a modification of tryptophan residues with a single mannose and can affect protein folding, secretion, and/or function. To date, only a few proteins have been demonstrated to be C-mannosylated, and studies that globally assess protein C-mannosylation are scarce. To interrogate the C-mannosylome of human induced pluripotent stem cells, we compared the secretomes of CRISPR-Cas9 mutants lacking either the C-mannosyltransferase DPY19L1 or DPY19L3 to WT human induced pluripotent stem cells using MS-based quantitative proteomics. The secretion of numerous proteins was reduced in these mutants, including that of A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with ThromboSpondin Motifs 16 (ADAMTS16), an extracellular protease that was previously reported to be essential for optic fissure fusion in zebrafish eye development. To test the functional relevance of this observation, we targeted dpy19l1 or dpy19l3 in embryos of the Japanese rice fish medaka (Oryzias latipes) by CRISPR-Cas9. We observed that targeting of dpy19l3 partially caused defects in optic fissure fusion, called coloboma. We further showed in a cellular model that DPY19L1 and DPY19L3 mediate C-mannosylation of a recombinantly expressed thrombospondin type 1 repeat of ADAMTS16 and thereby support its secretion. Taken together, our findings imply that DPY19L3-mediated C-mannosylation is involved in eye development by assisting secretion of the extracellular protease ADAMTS16.
PXD024696	33975903	Quantitative Proteomics Identifies Secreted Diagnostic Biomarkers as well as Tumor-Dependent Prognostic Targets for Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma. 	Quantitative proteomics identifies secreted diagnostic biomarkers as well as tumor-dependent prognostic targets for clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma	Renal Cell Carcinoma, biomarkers, drug repurposing, urine	Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the third most common and most malignant urological cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of 10% for patients with advanced tumors. Here, we identified 10,160 unique proteins by in-depth quantitative proteomics, of which 955 proteins were significantly regulated between tumor and normal adjacent tissues. We verified four putatively secreted biomarker candidates, namely, PLOD2, FERMT3, SPARC, and SIRPalpha, as highly expressed proteins that are not affected by intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity. Moreover, SPARC displayed a significant increase in urine samples of patients with ccRCC, making it a promising marker for the detection of the disease in body fluids. Furthermore, based on molecular expression profiles, we propose a biomarker panel for the robust classification of ccRCC tumors into two main clusters, which significantly differed in patient outcome with an almost three times higher risk of death for cluster 1 tumors compared with cluster 2 tumors. Moreover, among the most significant clustering proteins, 13 were targets of repurposed inhibitory FDA-approved drugs. Our rigorous proteomics approach identified promising diagnostic and tumor-discriminative biomarker candidates which can serve as therapeutic targets for the treatment of ccRCC. IMPLICATIONS: Our in-depth quantitative proteomics analysis of ccRCC tissues identifies the putatively secreted protein SPARC as a promising urine biomarker and reveals two molecular tumor phenotypes.
PXD025195	33976187	Androgen signaling uses a writer and a reader of ADP-ribosylation to regulate protein complex assembly. 	An androgen signaling axis uses a writer and a reader of ADP-ribosylation to control protein complex assembly	Androgen receptor, LC-MS, mono-ADP ribosyltransferase	Androgen signaling through the androgen receptor (AR) directs gene expression in both normal and prostate cancer cells. Androgen regulates multiple aspects of the AR life cycle, including its localization and post-translational modification, but understanding how modifications are read and integrated with AR activity has been difficult. Here, we show that ADP-ribosylation regulates AR through a nuclear pathway mediated by Parp7. We show that Parp7 mono-ADP-ribosylates agonist-bound AR, and that ADP-ribosyl-cysteines within the N-terminal domain mediate recruitment of the E3 ligase Dtx3L/Parp9. Molecular recognition of ADP-ribosyl-cysteine is provided by tandem macrodomains in Parp9, and Dtx3L/Parp9 modulates expression of a subset of AR-regulated genes. Parp7, ADP-ribosylation of AR, and AR-Dtx3L/Parp9 complex assembly are inhibited by Olaparib, a compound used clinically to inhibit poly-ADP-ribosyltransferases Parp1/2. Our study reveals the components of an androgen signaling axis that uses a writer and reader of ADP-ribosylation to regulate protein-protein interactions and AR activity.
PXD021305	33976225	The ubiquitylation of IL-1beta limits its cleavage by caspase-1 and targets it for proteasomal degradation. 	The inflammasome-activated cytokine IL-1beta is targeted for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation to limit its inflammatory potential	Interleukin-1, Toll-like receptor, caspase-1, caspase-8, inflammasome, inflammation, proteasome, ubiquitin	Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is activated by inflammasome-associated caspase-1 in rare autoinflammatory conditions and in a variety of other inflammatory diseases. Therefore, IL-1beta activity must be fine-tuned to enable anti-microbial responses whilst limiting collateral damage. Here, we show that precursor IL-1beta is rapidly turned over by the proteasome and this correlates with its decoration by K11-linked, K63-linked and K48-linked ubiquitin chains. The ubiquitylation of IL-1beta is not just a degradation signal triggered by inflammasome priming and activating stimuli, but also limits IL-1beta cleavage by caspase-1. IL-1beta K133 is modified by ubiquitin and forms a salt bridge with IL-1beta D129. Loss of IL-1beta K133 ubiquitylation, or disruption of the K133:D129 electrostatic interaction, stabilizes IL-1beta. Accordingly, Il1b(K133R/K133R) mice have increased levels of precursor IL-1beta upon inflammasome priming and increased production of bioactive IL-1beta, both in vitro and in response to LPS injection. These findings identify mechanisms that can limit IL-1beta activity and safeguard against damaging inflammation.
PXD025257	33980013	Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of WD-Repeat-Containing Protein 5 (WDR5) Degraders. 	Proteomics analysis with the WDR5 PROTACs	PROTAC, Protein degrader, WDR5	Histone H3K4 methylation serves as a post-translational hallmark of actively transcribed genes and is introduced by histone methyltransferase (HMT) and its regulatory scaffolding proteins. One of these is the WD-repeat-containing protein 5 (WDR5) that has also been associated with controlling long noncoding RNAs and transcription factors including MYC. The wide influence of dysfunctional HMT complexes and the typically upregulated MYC levels in diverse tumor types suggested WDR5 as an attractive drug target. Indeed, protein-protein interface inhibitors for two protein interaction interfaces on WDR5 have been developed. While such compounds only inhibit a subset of WDR5 interactions, chemically induced proteasomal degradation of WDR5 might represent an elegant way to target all oncogenic functions. This study presents the design, synthesis, and evaluation of two diverse WDR5 degrader series based on two WIN site binding scaffolds and shows that linker nature and length strongly influence degradation efficacy.
PXD016781	33980486	The SAM domain-containing protein 1 (SAMD1) acts as a repressive chromatin regulator at unmethylated CpG islands. 	The SAM domain-containing protein 1 (SAMD1) acts as a repressive chromatin regulator at unmethylated CpG islands	Chromatin, CpG islands, Transcription	CpG islands (CGIs) are key regulatory DNA elements at most promoters, but how they influence the chromatin status and transcription remains elusive. Here, we identify and characterize SAMD1 (SAM domain-containing protein 1) as an unmethylated CGI-binding protein. SAMD1 has an atypical winged-helix domain that directly recognizes unmethylated CpG-containing DNA via simultaneous interactions with both the major and the minor groove. The SAM domain interacts with L3MBTL3, but it can also homopolymerize into a closed pentameric ring. At a genome-wide level, SAMD1 localizes to H3K4me3-decorated CGIs, where it acts as a repressor. SAMD1 tethers L3MBTL3 to chromatin and interacts with the KDM1A histone demethylase complex to modulate H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels at CGIs, thereby providing a mechanism for SAMD1-mediated transcriptional repression. The absence of SAMD1 impairs ES cell differentiation processes, leading to misregulation of key biological pathways. Together, our work establishes SAMD1 as a newly identified chromatin regulator acting at unmethylated CGIs.
PXD023680	33980814	Loss of CEP70 function affects acrosome biogenesis and flagella formation during spermiogenesis. 	Loss of Cep70 function affects acrosome biogenesis and flagella formation during spermiogenesis	Cep70, acrosome biogenesis, flagella formation, male infertility, spermiogenesis	The spermatogenesis process is complex and delicate, and any error in a step may cause spermatogenesis arrest and even male infertility. According to our previous transcriptomic data, CEP70 is highly expressed throughout various stages of human spermatogenesis, especially during the meiosis and deformation stages. CEP70 is present in sperm tails and that it exists in centrosomes as revealed by human centrosome proteomics. However, the specific mechanism of this protein in spermatogenesis is still unknown. In this study, we found a heterozygous site of the same mutation on CEP70 through mutation screening of patients with clinical azoospermia. To further verify, we deleted CEP70 in mice and found that it caused abnormal spermatogenesis, leading to male sterility. We found that the knockout of CEP70 did not affect the prophase of meiosis I, but led to male germ-cell apoptosis and abnormal spermiogenesis. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, we found that the deletion of CEP70 resulted in the abnormal formation of flagella and acrosomes during spermiogenesis. Tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that the absence of CEP70 led to a significant decrease in the proteins associated with the formation of the flagella, head, and acrosome of sperm, and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Taken together, our results show that CEP70 is essential for acrosome biogenesis and flagella formation during spermiogenesis.
PXD024620	33980844	Mitofusin-2 stabilizes adherens junctions and suppresses endothelial inflammation via modulation of beta-catenin signaling. 	Identification of Mfn2 interacting proteins in homeostatic endothelial cells	AP-MS, LC-MS	Endothelial barrier integrity is ensured by the stability of the adherens junction (AJ) complexes comprised of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin as well as accessory proteins such as beta-catenin and p120-catenin. Disruption of the endothelial barrier due to disassembly of AJs results in tissue edema and the influx of inflammatory cells. Using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, we observe that the mitochondrial protein Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) co-localizes at the plasma membrane with VE-cadherin and beta-catenin in endothelial cells during homeostasis. Upon inflammatory stimulation, Mfn2 is sulfenylated, the Mfn2/beta-catenin complex disassociates from the AJs and Mfn2 accumulates in the nucleus where Mfn2 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin. Endothelial-specific deletion of Mfn2 results in inflammatory activation, indicating an anti-inflammatory role of Mfn2 in vivo. Our results suggest that Mfn2 acts in a non-canonical manner to suppress the inflammatory response by stabilizing cell-cell adherens junctions and by binding to the transcriptional activator beta-catenin.
PXD025032	33981039	Mitochondrial TNAP controls thermogenesis by hydrolysis of phosphocreatine. 	Characterization of a mitochondria associated phosphocreatine phosphatase in thermogenic adipocytes	TNAP, adipocyte, obesity, phosphocreatine, thermogenesis	Adaptive thermogenesis has attracted much attention because of its ability to increase systemic energy expenditure and to counter obesity and diabetes(1-3). Recent data have indicated that thermogenic fat cells use creatine to stimulate futile substrate cycling, dissipating chemical energy as heat(4,5). This model was based on the super-stoichiometric relationship between the amount of creatine added to mitochondria and the quantity of oxygen consumed. Here we provide direct evidence for the molecular basis of this futile creatine cycling activity in mice. Thermogenic fat cells have robust phosphocreatine phosphatase activity, which is attributed to tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). TNAP hydrolyses phosphocreatine to initiate a futile cycle of creatine dephosphorylation and phosphorylation. Unlike in other cells, TNAP in thermogenic fat cells is localized to the mitochondria, where futile creatine cycling occurs. TNAP expression is powerfully induced when mice are exposed to cold conditions, and its inhibition in isolated mitochondria leads to a loss of futile creatine cycling. In addition, genetic ablation of TNAP in adipocytes reduces whole-body energy expenditure and leads to rapid-onset obesity in mice, with no change in movement or feeding behaviour. These data illustrate the critical role of TNAP as a phosphocreatine phosphatase in the futile creatine cycle.
PXD024639	33981677	An Ultrafast N-Glycoproteome Analysis Method Using Thermoresponsive Magnetic Fluid-Immobilized Enzymes. 	Human urinary protein and glycopeotein LC-MSMS	urinary proteins	N-Glycosylation is one of the most common and important post-translational modification methods, and it plays a vital role in controlling many biological processes. Increasing discovery of abnormal alterations in N-linked glycans associated with many diseases leads to greater demands for rapid and efficient N-glycosylation profiling in large-scale clinical samples. In the workflow of global N-glycosylation analysis, enzymatic digestion is the main rate-limiting step, and it includes both protease digestion and peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase (PNGase) F deglycosylation. Prolonged incubation time is generally required because of the limited digestion efficiency of the conventional in-solution digestion method. Here, we propose novel thermoresponsive magnetic fluid (TMF)-immobilized enzymes (trypsin or PNGase F) for ultrafast and highly efficient proteome digestion and deglycosylation. Unlike other magnetic material-immobilized enzymes, TMF-immobilized enzymes display a unique temperature-triggered magnetic response behavior. At room temperature, a TMF-immobilized enzyme completely dissolves in an aqueous solution and forms a homogeneous system with a protein/peptide sample for efficient digestion but cannot be separated by magnetic force because of its excellent water dispersity. Above its lower critical solution temperature (LCST), thermoflocculation of a TMF-immobilized enzyme allows it to be easily recovered by increasing the temperature and magnetic force. Taking advantage of the unique homogeneous reaction of a TMF-immobilized enzyme, both protein digestion and glycopeptide deglycosylation can be finished within 3 min, and the whole sample processing time can be reduced by more than 20 times. The application of a TMF-immobilized enzyme in large-scale profiling of protein N-glycosylation in urine samples led to the successful identification of 2,197 N-glycopeptides and further demonstrated the potential of this strategy for fast and high-throughput analysis of N-glycoproteome in clinical samples.
PXD020262	33983919	Generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species is controlled by ATPase inhibitory factor 1 and regulates cognition. 	Genetic regulation of the ATP synthase in neurons modulates cognition	hippocampus, iTRAQ	The mitochondrial ATP synthase emerges as key hub of cellular functions controlling the production of ATP, cellular signaling, and fate. It is regulated by the ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), which is highly abundant in neurons. Herein, we ablated or overexpressed IF1 in mouse neurons to show that IF1 dose defines the fraction of active/inactive enzyme in vivo, thereby controlling mitochondrial function and the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses indicate that IF1 dose regulates mitochondrial metabolism, synaptic function, and cognition. Ablation of IF1 impairs memory, whereas synaptic transmission and learning are enhanced by IF1 overexpression. Mechanistically, quenching the IF1-mediated increase in mtROS production in mice overexpressing IF1 reduces the increased synaptic transmission and obliterates the learning advantage afforded by the higher IF1 content. Overall, IF1 plays a key role in neuronal function by regulating the fraction of ATP synthase responsible for mitohormetic mtROS signaling.
PXD020203	33984813	The application of forensic proteomics to identify an unknown snake venom in a deceased toddler. 	Forensic proteomics to identify an unknown snake venom in blood	Forensic serology, forensic proteomics, snake venom	Proteomics is the global analysis of proteins in a sample, and its methodologies are commonly applied in life science research. Despite its wide applicability however, proteomics is rarely used as a tool in criminal investigations. Here we present a case where the technique provided key evidence in a case that involved the death of a two-year old girl. The defendant was known to keep exotic snakes, including several venomous species, which led the coroner to probe whether there could be snake venom in the blood of the deceased. One major challenge of the investigation was the overwhelming presence of several blood proteins, such as apolipoprotein and complement proteins, which hinders the detection of less abundant analytes. In a counter-acting strategy, a combination of immunodepletion and fractionation methods was used; the sample was then submitted to tandem mass spectrometry for peptide identification. Using this strategy, 15,000 peptides could be sequenced. However, the subsequent challenge was to differentiate between human and snake proteins, given the genetic similarities that are shared by the two vertebrate species. After a thorough bioinformatics search and manual inspection, we found that<1% of the sequenced peptides could be matched unequivocally to snake proteins, including a well-known venom component, phospholipase A2. This evidence, in part, led to a court-issued search warrant of the defendant's home, followed by his arrest and an eventual guilty plea with formal sentencing to 18 months in prison. The work outlined here is an example of how proteomics technology can help to expand the toolkit for molecular forensics.
PXD024139	33986153	A prometastatic splicing program regulated by SNRPA1 interactions with structured RNA elements. 	Intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) of proteins in MDA-MB231	MDA-MB231, absolute protein quantification, breast cancer, iBAQ	Aberrant alternative splicing is a hallmark of cancer, yet the underlying regulatory programs that control this process remain largely unknown. Here, we report a systematic effort to decipher the RNA structural code that shapes pathological splicing during breast cancer metastasis. We discovered a previously unknown structural splicing enhancer that is enriched near cassette exons with increased inclusion in highly metastatic cells. We show that the spliceosomal protein small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A' (SNRPA1) interacts with these enhancers to promote cassette exon inclusion. This interaction enhances metastatic lung colonization and cancer cell invasion, in part through SNRPA1-mediated regulation of PLEC alternative splicing, which can be counteracted by splicing modulating morpholinos. Our findings establish a noncanonical regulatory role for SNRPA1 as a prometastatic splicing enhancer in breast cancer.
PXD027988	33986356	Simultaneous quantitative profiling of clinically relevant immune markers in neonatal stool swabs to reveal inflammation. 	Simultaneous quantitative profiling of clinically relevant immune markers in neonatal stool swabs to reveal inflammation	fecal inflammatory markers, immune response, microbial colonization, targeted quantitative proteomics	An aberrant immune response developed early in life may trigger inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and food allergies (e.g., celiac disease). Fecal levels of immune markers categorize an inflammatory response (e.g., food allergy, autoimmune) paralleled with the initial microbial colonization. The immunoaffinity assays are routinely applied to quantify circulating immune protein markers in blood/serum. However, a reliable, multiplex assay to quantify fecal levels of immune proteins is unavailable. We developed mass spectrometry assays to simultaneously quantify fecal calprotectin, myeloperoxidase, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, eosinophil cationic protein, alpha-1-antitrypsin 1, and adaptive immunity effectors in 134 neonatal stool swabs. We optimized extraction and proteolytic protocol and validated the multiplex assay in terms of linearity of response (> 100; typically 0.04 to 14.77 microg/mg of total protein), coefficient of determination (R(2); > 0.99), the limit of detection (LOD; 0.003 to 0.04 microg/mg of total protein), the limit of quantification (LOQ; 0.009 to 0.122 microg/mg of total protein) and robustness. The median CV of intra- and interday precision was 9.8% and 14.1%, respectively. We quantified breast milk-derived IGHA2 to differentiate meconium from feces samples and to detect the first food intake. An early life profiling of immune markers reflects disrupted intestinal homeostasis, and it is perhaps suitable for pre-symptomatic interception of IBD and food allergies.
PXD024756	33986449	Regulation of mammalian 3D genome organization and histone H3K9 dimethylation by H3K9 methyltransferases. 	Regulation of mammalian 3D genome organization and histone H3K9 dimethylation by H3K9 methyltransferases	Histone H3 methylation	Histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) is a highly conserved silencing epigenetic mark. Chromatin marked with H3K9me2 forms large domains in mammalian cells and overlaps well with lamina-associated domains and the B compartment defined by Hi-C. However, the role of H3K9me2 in 3-dimensional (3D) genome organization remains unclear. Here, we investigated genome-wide H3K9me2 distribution, transcriptome, and 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells following the inhibition or depletion of H3K9 methyltransferases (MTases): G9a, GLP, SETDB1, SUV39H1, and SUV39H2. We show that H3K9me2 is regulated by all five MTases; however, H3K9me2 and transcription in the A and B compartments are regulated by different MTases. H3K9me2 in the A compartments is primarily regulated by G9a/GLP and SETDB1, while H3K9me2 in the B compartments is regulated by all five MTases. Furthermore, decreased H3K9me2 correlates with changes to more active compartmental state that accompanied transcriptional activation. Thus, H3K9me2 contributes to inactive compartment setting.
PXD024944	33987184	Staging Encystation Progression in Giardia lamblia Using Encystation-Specific Vesicle Morphology and Associating Molecular Markers. 	Stage-specific, morphological and molecular markers of encystation in Giardia lamblia	Encystation, Giardia, Membrane trafficking, Rac, Rho GTPase	Differentiation into environmentally resistant cysts is required for transmission of the ubiquitous intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia. Encystation in Giardia requires the production, processing and transport of Cyst Wall Proteins (CWPs) in developmentally induced, Golgi-like, Encystation Specific Vesicles (ESVs). Progress through this trafficking pathway can be followed by tracking CWP localization over time. However, there is no recognized system to distinguish the advancing stages of this process which can complete at variable rates depending on how encystation is induced. Here, we propose a staging system for encysting Giardia based on the morphology of CWP1-stained ESVs. We demonstrate the molecular distinctiveness of maturing ESVs at these stages by following GlRab GTPases through encystation. Previously, we established that Giardia's sole Rho family GTPase, GlRac, associates with ESVs and has a role in regulating their maturation and the secretion of their cargo. As a proof of principle, we delineate the relationship between GlRac and ESV stages. Through proteomic studies, we identify putative interactors of GlRac that could be used as additional ESV stage markers. This staging system provides a common descriptor of ESV maturation regardless of the source of encysting cells. Furthermore, the identified set of molecular markers for ESV stages will be a powerful tool for characterizing trafficking mutants that impair ESV maturation and morphology.
PXD022926	33987838	Mapping of the amniotic fluid proteome of fetuses with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract identifies plastin 3 as a protein involved in glomerular integrity. 	Nano-LC-MS/MS proteomics in amniotic fluid from CAKUT patients	CAKUT, amniotic fluid, chronic kidney disease, plastin-3	Congenital anomalies of the kidney and the urinary tract (CAKUT) are the first cause of chronic kidney disease in childhood. Several genetic and environmental origins are associated with CAKUT, but most pathogenic pathways remain elusive. Considering the amniotic fluid (AF) composition as a proxy for fetal kidney development, we analyzed the AF proteome from non-severe CAKUT (n = 19), severe CAKUT (n = 14), and healthy control (n = 22) fetuses using LC-MS/MS. We identified 471 significant proteins that discriminated the three AF groups with 81% precision. Among them, eight proteins independent of gestational age (CSPG4, LMAN2, ENDOD1, ANGPTL2, PRSS8, NGFR, ROBO4, PLS3) were associated with both the presence and the severity of CAKUT. Among those, five were part of a protein-protein interaction network involving proteins previously identified as being potentially associated with CAKUT. The actin-bundling protein PLS3 (plastin 3) was the only protein displaying a gradually increased AF abundance from control, via non-severe, to severe CAKUT. Immunohistochemistry experiments showed that PLS3 was expressed in the human fetal as well as in both the fetal and the postnatal mouse kidney. In zebrafish embryos, depletion of PLS3 led to a general disruption of embryonic growth including reduced pronephros development. In postnatal Pls3-knockout mice, kidneys were macroscopically normal, but the glomerular ultrastructure showed thickening of the basement membrane and fusion of podocyte foot processes. These structural changes were associated with albuminuria and decreased expression of podocyte markers including Wilms' tumor-1 protein, nephrin, and podocalyxin. In conclusion, we provide the first map of the CAKUT AF proteome that will serve as a reference for future studies. Among the proteins strongly associated with CAKUT, PLS3 did surprisingly not specifically affect nephrogenesis but was found as a new contributor in the maintenance of normal kidney function, at least in part through the control of glomerular integrity.

PXD023371	33990310	Amino Acid Analog Induces Stress Response in Marine Synechococcus. 	Amino acid analog induces stress response in marine Synechococcus	BONCAT, NCAAs, Synechococcus, phytoplankton	Characterizing the cell-level metabolic trade-offs that phytoplankton exhibit in response to changing environmental conditions is important for predicting the impact of these changes on marine food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycling. The time-selective proteome-labeling approach, bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), has potential to provide insight into differential allocation of resources at the cellular level, especially when coupled with proteomics. However, the application of this technique in marine phytoplankton remains limited. We demonstrate that the marine cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. and two groups of eukaryotic algae take up the modified amino acid l-homopropargylglycine (HPG), suggesting that BONCAT can be used to detect translationally active phytoplankton. However, the impact of HPG addition on growth dynamics varied between groups of phytoplankton. In addition, proteomic analysis of Synechococcus cells grown with HPG revealed a physiological shift in nitrogen metabolism, general protein stress, and energy production, indicating a potential limitation for the use of BONCAT in understanding the cell-level response of Synechococcus sp. to environmental change. Variability in HPG sensitivity between algal groups and the impact of HPG on Synechococcus physiology indicates that particular considerations should be taken when applying this technique to other marine taxa or mixed marine microbial communities. IMPORTANCE Phytoplankton form the base of the marine food web and substantially impact global energy and nutrient flow. Marine picocyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus comprise a large portion of phytoplankton biomass in the ocean and therefore are important model organisms. The technical challenges of environmental proteomics in mixed microbial communities have limited our ability to detect the cell-level adaptations of phytoplankton communities to a changing environment. The proteome labeling technique, bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), has potential to address some of these challenges by simplifying proteomic analyses. This study explores the ability of marine phytoplankton to take up the modified amino acid, l-homopropargylglycine (HPG), required for BONCAT, and investigates the proteomic response of Synechococcus to HPG. We not only demonstrate that cyanobacteria can take up HPG but also highlight the physiological impact of HPG on Synechococcus, which has implications for future applications of this technique in the marine environment.
PXD021105	33992777	Adipose Triglyceride Lipase Loss Promotes a Metabolic Switch in A549 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cell Spheroids. 	Loss of adipose triglyceride lipase aids cancer growth in 3D	ATGL, lung cancer, spheroids	Cancer cells undergo complex metabolic adaptations to survive and thrive in challenging environments. This is particularly prominent for solid tumors, where cells in the core of the tumor are under severe hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. However, such conditions are often not recapitulated in the typical 2D in vitro cancer models, where oxygen as well as nutrient exposure is quite uniform. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of a key neutral lipid hydrolase, namely adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), in cancer cells that are exposed to more tumor-like conditions. To that end, we cultured lung cancer cells lacking ATGL as multicellular spheroids in 3D and subjected them to comprehensive proteomics analysis and metabolic phenotyping. Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021105. As a result, we report that loss of ATGL enhanced growth of spheroids and facilitated their adaptation to hypoxia, by increasing the influx of glucose and endorsing a pro-Warburg effect. This was followed by changes in lipid metabolism and an increase in protein production. Interestingly, the observed phenotype was also recapitulated in an even more "in vivo like" setup, when cancer spheroids were grown on chick chorioallantoic membrane, but not when cells were cultured as a 2D monolayer. In addition, we demonstrate that according to the publicly available cancer databases, an inverse relation between ATGL expression and higher glucose dependence can be observed. In conclusion, we provide indications that ATGL is involved in regulation of glucose metabolism of cancer cells when grown in 3D (mimicking solid tumors) and as such could be an important factor of the treatment outcome for some cancer types. Finally, we also ratify the need for alternative cell culture models, as the majority of phenotypes observed in 3D and spheroids grown on chick chorioallantoic membrane were not observed in 2D cell culture.
PXD021513	33992839	Biostimulant impacts of Glutacetine(R) and derived formulations (VNT1 and VNT4) on the bread wheat grain proteome. 	Biostimulant impacts of Glutacetine® and derivated formulations on bread wheat grain proteome	Wheat, flour quality, nitrogen fertilizer, plant biostimulant	Nitrogen (N) fertilizer is essential to ensure grain yield and quality in bread wheat. Improving N use efficiency is therefore crucial for wheat grain protein quality. In the present work, we analysed the effects on the winter wheat grain proteome of biostimulants containing Glutacetine(R) or two derived formulations (VNT1 and 4) when mixed with urea-ammonium-nitrate fertilizer. A large-scale quantitative proteomics analysis of two wheat flour fractions produced a dataset of 4369 identified proteins. Quantitative analysis revealed 9, 39 and 96 proteins with a significant change in abundance after Glutacetine(R), VNT1 and VNT4 treatments, respectively, with a common set of 11 proteins that were affected by two different biostimulants. The major effects impacted proteins involved in (i) protein synthesis regulation (mainly ribosomal and binding proteins), (ii) defence and responses to stresses (including chitin-binding protein, heat shock 70 kDa protein 1 and glutathione S-transferase proteins), (iii) storage functions related to gluten protein alpha-gliadins and starch synthase and (iv) seed development with proteins implicated in protease activity, energy machinery, and the C and N metabolism pathways. Altogether, our study showed that Glutacetine(R), VNT1 and VNT4 biostimulants positively affected protein composition related to grain quality. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021513. SIGNIFICANCE: We performed a large-scale quantitative proteomics study of the total protein extracts from flour samples to determine the effect of Glutacetine(R)-based biostimulants treatment on the protein composition of bread wheat grain. To our knowledge, only a few studies in the literature have applied proteomic approaches to study bread wheat grains and in particular to investigate the effect of biostimulants on the grain proteome of this cereal crop. In addition, most approaches used fractional extraction of proteins to target reserve proteins followed electrophoresis which leads to low identification rate of proteins. We identified and quantified a large protein dataset of 4369 proteins and determined ontological class of proteins affected by biostimulants treatments. Our proteomics investigation revealed the important role of these new biostimulants in achieving significant changes in protein synthesis regulation, storage functions, protease activity, energy machinery, C and N metabolism pathways and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in grain.
PXD024293	33993482	Integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of microplasts derived from macrophage-conditioned medium-treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells. 	LC-MSMS of microplasts derived from macrophage conditioned medium treated breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells. Pooja Kamal Melwani, M.Sc., Nishad S, PhD, Badri Narain Pandey, PhD, Radiation Signalling and Cancer Biology Section, Radiation Biology & Health S	Cytoplasts, Large extracellular vesicles, MCF-7, Microplasts, breast cancer	Microplasts are large extracellular vesicles originating from migratory, invasive, and metastatic cancer cells. Here, to gain insight into the role of microplasts in cancer progression, we performed a proteomic and transcriptomic characterization of microplasts isolated from MCF-7 breast cancer cells treated with macrophage-conditioned medium. These cells were found to be viable, highly migratory, and metabolically active, indicating that microplasts derived from these cells are not apoptotic bodies. Transcriptomic/proteomic analyses identified 10273 mRNAs and 821 proteins in microplasts. Interestingly, 377 microplast mRNAs coded for corresponding microplast proteins. Microplast mRNAs and proteins were mainly associated with binding and catalytic activities. Microplasts showed enrichment of mRNAs involved in transcription regulation and proteins involved in processes such as cell-cell adhesion and translation. Pathway analysis showed enrichment of ribosomes and carbon metabolism. These results suggest a close resemblance between microplasts and parent cells, with mRNA and protein cargo relevant in intercellular signaling.
PXD024058	33995084	Tianlongkechuanling Inhibits Pulmonary Fibrosis Through Down-Regulation of Arginase-Ornithine Pathway. 	Tianlongkechuanling Inhibits Pulmonary Fibrosis Through Down-Regulation Of Arginase-Ornithine Pathway	Tianlongkechuanling, arginase, arginase-ornithine pathway, pulmonary fibrosis	Background: Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF) is an interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lungs, which disrupts the structure and gas exchange of the alveoli. There are only two approved therapies for PF, nintedanib (Nib) and pirfenidone. Therefore, the use of Chinese medicine for PF is attracting attention. Tianlongkechuanling (TL) is an effective Chinese formula that has been applied clinically to alleviate PF, which can enhance lung function and quality of life. Purpose: The potential effects and specific mechanisms of TL have not been fully explored, yet. In the present study, proteomics was performed to explore the therapeutic protein targets of TL on Bleomycin (BLM)-induced Pulmonary Fibrosis. Method: BLM-induced PF mice models were established. Hematoxylineosin staining and Masson staining were used to analyze histopathological changes and collagen deposition. To screen the differential proteins expression between the Control, BLM, BLM + TL and BLM + Nib (BLM + nintedanib) groups, quantitative proteomics was performed using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling with nanoLC-MS/MS [nano liquid chromatographymass spectrometry]). Changes in the profiles of the expressed proteins were analyzed using the bioinformatics tools Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The protein-protein interactions (PPI) were established by STRING. Expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), Collagen I (Col1a1), Fibronectin (Fn1) and enzymes in arginase-ornithine pathway were detected by Western blot or RT-PCR. Result: TL treatments significantly ameliorated BLM-induced collagen deposition in lung tissues. Moreover, TL can inhibit the protein expressions of alpha-SMA and the mRNA expressions of Col1a1 and Fn1. Using TMT technology, we observed 253 differentially expressed proteins related to PPI networks and involved different KEGG pathways. Arginase-ornithine pathway is highly significant. The expression of arginase1 (Arg1), carbamoyltransferase (OTC), carbamoy-phosphate synthase (CPS1), argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was significantly decreased after TL treatments. Conclusion: Administration of TL in BLM-induced mice resulted in decreasing pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings propose that the down regulation of arginase-ornithine pathway expression with the reduction of arginase biosynthesis is a central mechanism and potential treatment for pulmonary fibrosis with the prevention of TL.
PXD019981	33995514	Proteomics, toxicity and antivenom neutralization of Sri Lankan and Indian Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) venoms. 	Proteome data of snake venoms_file 5	LCMS/MS, Snake venom, Venom proteome	BACKGROUND: The western Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) is widely distributed in South Asia, and geographical venom variation is anticipated among distant populations. Antivenoms used for Russell's viper envenomation are, however, raised typically against snakes from Southern India. The present study investigated and compared the venom proteomes of D. russelii from Sri Lanka (DrSL) and India (DrI), the immunorecognition of Indian VINS Polyvalent Antivenom (VPAV) and its efficacy in neutralizing the venom toxicity. METHODS: The venoms of DrSL and DrI were decomplexed with C18 high-performance liquid chromatography and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The proteins fractionated were identified through nano-ESI-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). The immunological studies were conducted with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The neutralization of the venom procoagulant effect was evaluated in citrated human plasma. The neutralization of the venom lethality was assessed in vivo in mice adopting the WHO protocol. RESULTS: DrSL and DrI venom proteomes showed comparable major protein families, with phospholipases A2 (PLA2) being the most abundant (> 60% of total venom proteins) and diverse (six protein forms identified). Both venoms were highly procoagulant and lethal (intravenous median lethal dose in mice, LD50 = 0.24 and 0.32 microg/g, for DrSL and DrI, respectively), while lacking hemorrhagic and anticoagulant activities. VPAV was immunoreactive toward DrSL and DrI venoms, indicating conserved protein antigenicity in the venoms. The high molecular weight venom proteins were, however, more effectively immunorecognized than small ones. VPAV was able to neutralize the coagulopathic and lethal effects of the venoms moderately. CONCLUSION: Considering that a large amount of venom can be injected by Russell's viper during envenomation, the potency of antivenom can be further improved for optimal neutralization and effective treatment. Region-specific venoms and key toxins may be incorporated into the immunization procedure during antivenom production.
PXD022826	33995652	A 9-kDa matricellular SPARC fragment released by cathepsin D exhibits pro-tumor activity in the triple-negative breast cancer microenvironment. 	A 9-kDa matricellular SPARC fragment released by cathepsin D exhibits pro-tumor activity in cancer	ECM, TNBC, matricellular protein, protease, proteolysis, tumor microenvironment	Rationale: Alternative therapeutic strategies based on tumor-specific molecular targets are urgently needed for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The protease cathepsin D (cath-D) is a marker of poor prognosis in TNBC and a tumor-specific extracellular target for antibody-based therapy. The identification of cath-D substrates is crucial for the mechanistic understanding of its role in the TNBC microenvironment and future therapeutic developments. Methods: The cath-D substrate repertoire was investigated by N-Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS)-based degradome analysis in a co-culture assay of TNBC cells and breast fibroblasts. Substrates were validated by amino-terminal oriented mass spectrometry of substrates (ATOMS). Cath-D and SPARC expression in TNBC was examined using an online transcriptomic survival analysis, tissue micro-arrays, TNBC cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), human TNBC samples, and mammary tumors from MMTV-PyMT Ctsd(-/-) knock-out mice. The biological role of SPARC and its fragments in TNBC were studied using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis, gene expression knockdown, co-culture assays, western blot analysis, RT-quantitative PCR, adhesion assays, Transwell motility, trans-endothelial migration and invasion assays. Results: TAILS analysis showed that the matricellular protein SPARC is a substrate of extracellular cath-D. In vitro, cath-D induced limited proteolysis of SPARC C-terminal extracellular Ca(2+) binding domain at acidic pH, leading to the production of SPARC fragments (34-, 27-, 16-, 9-, and 6-kDa). Similarly, cath-D secreted by TNBC cells cleaved fibroblast- and cancer cell-derived SPARC at the tumor pericellular acidic pH. SPARC cleavage also occurred in TNBC tumors. Among these fragments, only the 9-kDa SPARC fragment inhibited TNBC cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin, and stimulated their migration, endothelial transmigration, and invasion. Conclusions: Our study establishes a novel crosstalk between proteases and matricellular proteins in the tumor microenvironment through limited SPARC proteolysis, revealing a novel targetable 9-kDa bioactive SPARC fragment for new TNBC treatments. Our study will pave the way for the development of strategies for targeting bioactive fragments from matricellular proteins in TNBC.
PXD024279	33996800	ZNRF1 Mediates Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Ubiquitination to Control Receptor Lysosomal Trafficking and Degradation. 	Identification ubiquitination of EGFR by LC-MS/MS	CBL, EGFR, ZNRF1, ubiquitination	Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is crucial for development, tissue homeostasis, and immunity. Dysregulation of EGFR signaling is associated with numerous diseases. EGFR ubiquitination and endosomal trafficking are key events that regulate the termination of EGFR signaling, but their underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we reveal that ZNRF1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, controls ligand-induced EGFR signaling via mediating receptor ubiquitination. Deletion of ZNRF1 inhibits endosome-to-lysosome sorting of EGFR, resulting in delayed receptor degradation and prolonged downstream signaling. We further demonstrate that ZNRF1 and Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL), another E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for EGFR ubiquitination, mediate ubiquitination at distinct lysine residues on EGFR. Furthermore, loss of ZNRF1 results in increased susceptibility to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection due to enhanced EGFR-dependent viral entry. Our findings identify ZNRF1 as a novel regulator of EGFR signaling, which together with CBL controls ligand-induced EGFR ubiquitination and lysosomal trafficking.
PXD024564	33996900	Proteomic Analysis on Anti-Proliferative and Apoptosis Effects of Curcumin Analog, 1,5-bis(4-Hydroxy-3-Methyoxyphenyl)-1,4-Pentadiene-3-One-Treated Human Glioblastoma and Neuroblastoma Cells. 	Proteomic Analysis on Anti-proliferative and Apoptosis Effects of Curcumin Analogue, 1,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methyoxyphenyl)-1,4-pentadiene-3-one Treated Human Glioblastoma and Neuroblastoma Cells	Agilent 6500 iFunnel QTOF, neuroblastoma	Curcumin analogs with excellent biological properties have been synthesized to address and overcome the poor pharmacokinetic profiles of curcumin. This study aims to investigate the cytotoxicity, anti-proliferative, and apoptosis-inducing ability of curcumin analog, MS13 on human glioblastoma U-87 MG, and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, and to examine the global proteome changes in these cells following treatment. Our current findings showed that MS13 induced potent cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative effects on both cells. Increased caspase-3 activity and decreased bcl-2 concentration upon treatment indicate that MS13 induces apoptosis in these cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The label-free shotgun proteomic analysis has defined the protein profiles in both glioblastoma and neuroblastoma cells, whereby a total of nine common DEPs, inclusive of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), alpha-enolase (ENO1), heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha (HSP90AA1), Heat shock protein HSP 90-beta (HSP90AB1), Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A-1 (EFI5A), heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK), tubulin beta chain (TUBB), histone H2AX (H2AFX), and Protein SET were identified. Pathway analysis further elucidated that MS13 may induce its anti-tumor effects in both cells via the common enriched pathways, "Glycolysis" and "Post-translational protein modification." Conclusively, MS13 demonstrates an anti-cancer effect that may indicate its potential use in the management of brain malignancies.
PXD022472	33997237	Comparative proteomics of Brucella melitensis is a useful toolbox for developing prophylactic interventions in a One-Health context. 	Comparative proteomics of Brucella melitensis 16M and REV1	16m, Brucella melitensis, HDMSE, REV1, label-free	Brucellosis caused by Brucella melitensis is a zoonosis frequently reported in the Mediterranean and Middle-East regions and responsible for important economic losses and reduced animal welfare. To date, current strategies applied to control or eradicate the disease relies on diagnostic tests that suffer from limited specificity in non-vaccinated animals; while prophylactic measures, when applied, use a live attenuated bacterial strain characterized by residual virulence on adult pregnant animals and difficulties in distinguishing vaccinated from infected animals. To overcome these issues, studies are desired to elucidate the bacterial biology and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both the vaccinal strain and the pathogenic strains. Proteomics has a potential in tackling issues of One-Health concern; here, we employed label-free shotgun proteomics to investigate the protein repertoire of the vaccinal strain B. melitensis Rev.1 and compare it with the proteome of the Brucella melitensis 16 M, a reference strain representative of B. melitensis field strains. Comparative proteomics profiling underlines common and diverging traits between the two strains. Common features suggest the potential biochemical routes responsible for the residual virulence of the vaccinal strain, whilst the diverging traits are suggestive biochemical signatures to be further investigated to provide an optimized diagnostic capable of discriminating the vaccinated from infected animals. The data presented in this study are openly available in PRIDE data repository at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/, reference number PXD022472.
PXD024230	33997891	Proteoglycan profiling of human, rat and mouse insulin-secreting cells. 	Proteoglycan profiling of human, rat and mouse insulin-secreting cells	Chromogranin-A, glycosaminoglycan, insulin, insulinoma islet cells, proteoglycan	Proteoglycans (PGs) are proteins with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, such as chondroitin sulfate (CS) or heparan sulfate (HS), attached to serine residues. We have earlier shown that prohormones can carry CS, constituting a novel class of PGs. The mapping of GAG modifications of proteins in endocrine cells may thus assist us in delineating possible roles of PGs in endocrine cellular physiology. With this aim, we applied a glycoproteomic approach to identify PGs, their GAG chains and their attachment sites in insulin-secreting cells. Glycopeptides carrying GAG chains were enriched from human pancreatic islets, rat (INS-1 832/13) and mouse (MIN6, NIT-1) insulinoma cell lines by exchange chromatography, depolymerized with GAG lyases, and analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We identified CS modifications of chromogranin-A (CgA), islet amyloid polypeptide, secretogranin-1 and secretogranin-2, immunoglobulin superfamily member 10, and protein AMBP. Additionally, we identified two HS-modified prohormones (CgA and secretogranin-1), which was surprising, as prohormones are not typically regarded as HSPGs. For CgA, the glycosylation site carried either CS or HS, making it a so-called hybrid site. Additional HS sites were found on syndecan-1, syndecan-4, nerurexin-2, protein NDNF and testican-1. These results demonstrate that several prohormones, and other constituents of the insulin-secreting cells are PGs. Cell-targeted mapping of the GAG glycoproteome forms an important basis for better understanding of endocrine cellular physiology, and the novel CS and HS sites presented here provide important knowledge for future studies.
PXD019954	33999512	Cyr61 from adipose-derived stem cells promotes colorectal cancer metastasis and vasculogenic mimicry formation via integrin alphaV beta5. 	Receptor identification of Cyr61 on hunan colorectal cancer cell by LC-MS	Cyr61, LC-MS, hunan colorectal cancer cell, receptor	Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) play a vital role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, but the mechanism remains largely unknown. Herein, we found that ADSCs isolated from CRC patients produced more cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61) than those from healthy donors, and the elevated serum Cyr61 levels were associated with advanced TNM stages. Moreover, serum Cyr61 displayed a better diagnostic value for CRC compared to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA19-9). Mechanistically, integrin alphaV beta5 was identified as the functional receptor by which Cyr61 promotes CRC cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo by activating the alphaV beta5 /FAK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In addition, Cyr61 promotes vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation, thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis through a alphaV beta5 /FAK/HIF-1alpha/STAT3/MMP2 signaling cascade. Histologically, xenografts and clinical samples of CRC both exhibited VM, which was correlated with HIF-1alpha and MMP2 activation. Notably, we demonstrated the synergistic effect of combined anti-VM therapy (integrin alphaV beta5 inhibitor) and anti-VEGF therapy (bevacizumab) in patient-derived xenograft models. Further investigation showed that CRC cell-derived exosomal STAT3 promoted Cyr61 transcription in ADSCs. These findings indicate that Cyr61 derived from ADSCs plays a critical role in promoting CRC progression via integrin alphaV beta5 and provides a novel antitumor strategy by targeting Cyr61/alphaV beta5 .
PXD019056	33999959	Structure-activity mapping of ARHGAP36 reveals regulatory roles for its GAP homology and C-terminal domains. 	Wild-type and L317P mutant ARHGAP36 isoform 2 interactome	NIH-3T3	ARHGAP36 is an atypical Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family member that drives both spinal cord development and tumorigenesis, acting in part through an N-terminal motif that suppresses protein kinase A and activates Gli transcription factors. ARHGAP36 also contains isoform-specific N-terminal sequences, a central GAP-like module, and a unique C-terminal domain, and the functions of these regions remain unknown. Here we have mapped the ARHGAP36 structure-activity landscape using a deep sequencing-based mutagenesis screen and truncation mutant analyses. Using this approach, we have discovered several residues in the GAP homology domain that are essential for Gli activation and a role for the C-terminal domain in counteracting an N-terminal autoinhibitory motif that is present in certain ARHGAP36 isoforms. In addition, each of these sites modulates ARHGAP36 recruitment to the plasma membrane or primary cilium. Through comparative proteomics, we also have identified proteins that preferentially interact with active ARHGAP36, and we demonstrate that one binding partner, prolyl oligopeptidase-like protein, is a novel ARHGAP36 antagonist. Our work reveals multiple modes of ARHGAP36 regulation and establishes an experimental framework that can be applied towards other signaling proteins.
PXD064874	33	Effect of human erythrocyte stromata on complement activation. 	Neurons Release Serine to Support mRNA Translation in Pancreatic Cancer	Neurons, Pancreatic Cancer, Proteomimcs, Serine, mRNA	Stroma from either normal or PNH-like red cells is capable of inhibiting, to some extent, lysis in the sucrose test and enhancing lysis in the acidified-serum test. The same opposing effects are displayed by the exclusion peaks from Sephadex G-200 obtained from each stroma preparation, suggesting that the same factor could be responsible for both activities. Stromata and peaks also induce lysis of PNH-like cells in unacidified serum, indicating activation of complement through the alternate pathway. This is confirmed by immunoelectrophoretic observation. When serum previously activated through the alternate pathway is used in the sucrose test the amount of lysis is markedly reduced. This would indicate that the classical pathway activation can be controlled by the alternate pathway. The possible clinical significance of these factors in determining the haemolytic crisis in PNH patients is discussed.
PXD021706	34000434	Increased Wheat Protein Content via Introgression of an HMW Glutenin Selectively Reshapes the Grain Proteome. 	Increased wheat protein content via introgression of a HMW glutenin selectively reshapes the grain proteome	Wheat, mature grain	Introgression of a high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) allele, 1Ay21*, into commercial wheat cultivars increased overall grain protein content and bread-making quality, but the role of proteins beyond this HMW-GS itself was unknown. In addition to increased abundance of 1Ay HMW-GS, 115 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) were discovered between three cultivars and corresponding introgressed near-isogenic lines. Functional category analysis showed that the DAPs were predominantly other storage proteins and proteins involved in protein synthesis, protein folding, protein degradation, stress response, and grain development. Nearly half the genes encoding the DAPs showed strong coexpression patterns during grain development. Promoters of these genes are enriched in elements associated with transcription initiation and light response, indicating a potential connection between these cis-elements and grain protein accumulation. A model of how this HMW-GS enhances the abundance of machinery for protein synthesis and maturation during grain filling is proposed. This analysis not only provides insights into how introgression of the 1Ay21* improves grain protein content but also directs selection of protein candidates for future wheat quality breeding programs.
PXD022123	34000451	Discovery of Klf2 interactors in mouse embryonic stem cells by immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry utilizing exogenously expressed bait. 	Discovery of Klf2 Interactors in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells by Immunoprecipitation-Mass Spectrometry Utilizing Exogenously Expressed Bait	Klf2, Mouse embryonic stem cells, Snd1, exogenous bait, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry	Kruppel-like factor 2 (Klf2) is a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates embryonic stem cell-specific gene expression. Transcription cofactors such as p300 acetyltransferase and Erk kinases interact with Klf2, providing an additional layer of transcription regulation in embryonic stem cells. To carry out a thorough survey of the Klf2 interactome in embryonic stem cells and identify novel transcription cofactors, we designed a modified immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) method. In this method, recombinant Klf2, expressed and purified from Sf9 insect cells instead of ectopically expressed in cells, was used as bait. Using this modified IP-MS method, we discovered nine Klf2-interacting proteins, including the previously reported Crebbp and p300. These proteins showed at least an 8-fold increase in signal intensity in Klf2 pull-downs compared with controls, with P-values <0.010. Among the identified Klf2-binding proteins confirmed using our IP-MS workflow was Snd1, which we found to interact directly with Klf2 and function as a transcriptional coactivator of Klf2 to drive the Oct4 gene expression. Collectively, our IP-MS protocol may offer a useful tool for identifying novel transcription cofactors in stem cells.
PXD020216	34000623	Defective NET clearance contributes to sustained FXII activation in COVID-19-associated pulmonary thrombo-inflammation. 	Proteomics of lung tissues from COVID19 patients	COVID19, Covid-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, Pulmonary Thromboembolism, Pulmonary Thromboinflammation, Pulmonary Thrombosis, SARS-CoV-2 Infection	BACKGROUND: Coagulopathy and inflammation are hallmarks of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with increased mortality. Clinical and experimental data have revealed a role for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 disease. The mechanisms that drive thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19 are poorly understood. METHODS: We performed proteomic analysis and immunostaining of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients and patients with other lung pathologies. We further compared coagulation factor XII (FXII) and DNase activities in plasma samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy control donors and determined NET-induced FXII activation using a chromogenic substrate assay. FINDINGS: FXII expression and activity were increased in the lung parenchyma, within the pulmonary vasculature and in fibrin-rich alveolar spaces of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients. In agreement with this, plasmaaac acafajfoeeFXII activation (FXIIa) was increased in samples from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, FXIIa colocalized with NETs in COVID-19 lung tissue indicating that NETs accumulation leads to FXII contact activation in COVID-19. We further showed that an accumulation of NETs is partially due to impaired NET clearance by extracellular DNases as DNase substitution improved NET dissolution and reduced FXII activation in vitro. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, our study supports that the NET/FXII axis contributes to the pathogenic chain of procoagulant and proinflammatory responses in COVID-19. Targeting both NETs and FXIIa may offer a potential novel therapeutic strategy. FUNDING: This study was supported by the European Union (840189), the Werner Otto Medical Foundation Hamburg (8/95) and the German Research Foundation (FR4239/1-1, A11/SFB877, B08/SFB841 and P06/KFO306).
PXD022683	34001281	Genomic reconstruction of fossil and living microorganisms in ancient Siberian permafrost. 	Metaproteomic analyses of microbial community from ancient permafrost	Ancient permafrost, microbial community	BACKGROUND: Total DNA (intracellular, iDNA and extracellular, eDNA) from ancient permafrost records the mixed genetic repository of the past and present microbial populations through geological time. Given the exceptional preservation of eDNA under perennial frozen conditions, typical metagenomic sequencing of total DNA precludes the discrimination between fossil and living microorganisms in ancient cryogenic environments. DNA repair protocols were combined with high throughput sequencing (HTS) of separate iDNA and eDNA fraction to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from ancient microbial DNA entrapped in Siberian coastal permafrost. RESULTS: Despite the severe DNA damage in ancient permafrost, the coupling of DNA repair and HTS resulted in a total of 52 MAGs from sediments across a chronosequence (26-120 kyr). These MAGs were compared with those derived from the same samples but without utilizing DNA repair protocols. The MAGs from the youngest stratum showed minimal DNA damage and thus likely originated from viable, active microbial species. Many MAGs from the older and deeper sediment appear related to past aerobic microbial populations that had died upon freezing. MAGs from anaerobic lineages, including Asgard archaea, however exhibited minimal DNA damage and likely represent extant living microorganisms that have become adapted to the cryogenic and anoxic environments. The integration of aspartic acid racemization modeling and metaproteomics further constrained the metabolic status of the living microbial populations. Collectively, combining DNA repair protocols with HTS unveiled the adaptive strategies of microbes to long-term survivability in ancient permafrost. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that coupling of DNA repair protocols with simultaneous sequencing of iDNA and eDNA fractions enabled the assembly of MAGs from past and living microorganisms in ancient permafrost. The genomic reconstruction from the past and extant microbial populations expanded our understanding about the microbial successions and biogeochemical alterations from the past paleoenvironment to the present-day frozen state. Furthermore, we provided genomic insights into long-term survival mechanisms of microorganisms under cryogenic conditions through geological time. The combined strategies in this study can be extrapolated to examine other ancient non-permafrost environments and constrain the search for past and extant extraterrestrial life in permafrost and ice deposits on Mars.

PXD021804	34001852	PRMT6 activates cyclin D1 expression in conjunction with the transcription factor LEF1. 	Identification of interaction partners of PRMT6	Hematopoiesis, K562	The establishment of cell type specific gene expression by transcription factors and their epigenetic cofactors is central for cell fate decisions. Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) is an epigenetic regulator of gene expression mainly through methylating arginines at histone H3. This way it influences cellular differentiation and proliferation. PRMT6 lacks DNA-binding capability but is recruited by transcription factors to regulate gene expression. However, currently only a limited number of transcription factors have been identified, which facilitate recruitment of PRMT6 to key cell cycle related target genes. Here, we show that LEF1 contributes to the recruitment of PRMT6 to the central cell cycle regulator CCND1 (Cyclin D1). We identified LEF1 as an interaction partner of PRMT6. Knockdown of LEF1 or PRMT6 reduces CCND1 expression. This is in line with our observation that knockdown of PRMT6 increases the number of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle and decreases proliferation. These results improve the understanding of PRMT6 activity in cell cycle regulation. We expect that these insights will foster the rational development and usage of specific PRMT6 inhibitors for cancer therapy.
PXD024717	34002097	UCP1 governs liver extracellular succinate and inflammatory pathogenesis. 	UCP1-dependent depletion of liver extracellular succinate antagonizes inflammatory pathogenesis	BAT, Liver, UCP1, inflammation, thermogenesis	Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most prevalent liver pathology worldwide, is intimately linked with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Liver inflammation is a hallmark of NAFLD and is thought to contribute to tissue fibrosis and disease pathogenesis. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is exclusively expressed in brown and beige adipocytes, and has been extensively studied for its capacity to elevate thermogenesis and reverse obesity. Here we identify an endocrine pathway regulated by UCP1 that antagonizes liver inflammation and pathology, independent of effects on obesity. We show that, without UCP1, brown and beige fat exhibit a diminished capacity to clear succinate from the circulation. Moreover, UCP1KO mice exhibit elevated extracellular succinate in liver tissue that drives inflammation through ligation of its cognate receptor succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1) in liver-resident stellate cell and macrophage populations. Conversely, increasing brown and beige adipocyte content in mice antagonizes SUCNR1-dependent inflammatory signalling in the liver. We show that this UCP1-succinate-SUCNR1 axis is necessary to regulate liver immune cell infiltration and pathology, and systemic glucose intolerance in an obesogenic environment. As such, the therapeutic use of brown and beige adipocytes and UCP1 extends beyond thermogenesis and may be leveraged to antagonize NAFLD and SUCNR1-dependent liver inflammation.
PXD025685	34003260	Protein Composition and Associated Material Properties of Cobweb Spiders' Gumfoot Glue Droplets. 	Protein composition of cobweb spiders gumfoot glue droplets	Spider, Theridiaadae, glue	The origin of aggregate silk glands and their production of wet adhesive silks is considered a key innovation of the Araneoidea, a superfamily of spiders that build orb-webs and cobwebs. Orb-web weavers place aggregate glue on an extensible capture spiral, whereas cobweb weavers add it to the ends of strong, stiff fibers, called gumfoot lines. Here we describe the material behavior and quantitative proteomics of the aggregate glues of two cobweb weaving species, the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, and the common house spider, Parasteatoda tepidariorum. For each species, respectively, we identified 48 and 33 proteins that were significantly more abundant in the portion of the gumfoot line with glue than in its fibers. These proteins were more highly glycosylated and phosphorylated than proteins found in silk fibers without glue, which likely explains aggregate glue stickiness. Most glue-enriched proteins were of anterior aggregate gland origin, supporting the hypothesis that cobweb weavers' posterior aggregate glue is specialized for another function. We found that cobweb weaver glue droplets are stiffer and tougher than the adhesive of most orb-web weaving species. Attributes of gumfoot glue protein composition that likely contribute to this stiffness include the presence of multiple protein families with conserved cysteine residues, a bimodal distribution of isoelectric points, and families with conserved functions in protein aggregation, all of which should contribute to cohesive protein-protein interactions. House spider aggregate droplets were more responsive to humidity changes than black widow droplets, which could be mediated by differences in protein sequence, post-translational modifications, the non-protein components of the glue droplets, and/or the larger amount of aqueous material that surrounds the adhesive cores of their glue droplets.
PXD022962	34004147	The PP2A-Integrator-CDK9 axis fine-tunes transcription and can be targeted therapeutically in cancer. 	A PP2A-Integrator complex fine-tunes transcription by opposing CDK9	CDK9, PP2A, transcription	Gene expression by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is tightly controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) at discrete checkpoints during the transcription cycle. The pausing checkpoint following transcription initiation is primarily controlled by CDK9. We discovered that CDK9-mediated, RNAPII-driven transcription is functionally opposed by a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex that is recruited to transcription sites by the Integrator complex subunit INTS6. PP2A dynamically antagonizes phosphorylation of key CDK9 substrates including DSIF and RNAPII-CTD. Loss of INTS6 results in resistance to tumor cell death mediated by CDK9 inhibition, decreased turnover of CDK9 phospho-substrates, and amplification of acute oncogenic transcriptional responses. Pharmacological PP2A activation synergizes with CDK9 inhibition to kill both leukemic and solid tumor cells, providing therapeutic benefit in vivo. These data demonstrate that fine control of gene expression relies on the balance between kinase and phosphatase activity throughout the transcription cycle, a process dysregulated in cancer that can be exploited therapeutically.
PXD020292	34006841	CD8(+) T cell landscape in Indigenous and non-Indigenous people restricted by influenza mortality-associated HLA-A*24:02 allomorph. 	Influenza-derived peptide presentation by HLA-A*24:02	HLA, Immunopeptidome, Influenza	Indigenous people worldwide are at high risk of developing severe influenza disease. HLA-A*24:02 allele, highly prevalent in Indigenous populations, is associated with influenza-induced mortality, although the basis for this association is unclear. Here, we define CD8(+) T-cell immune landscapes against influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses in HLA-A*24:02-expressing Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals, human tissues, influenza-infected patients and HLA-A*24:02-transgenic mice. We identify immunodominant protective CD8(+) T-cell epitopes, one towards IAV and six towards IBV, with A24/PB2550-558-specific CD8(+) T cells being cross-reactive between IAV and IBV. Memory CD8(+) T cells towards these specificities are present in blood (CD27(+)CD45RA(-) phenotype) and tissues (CD103(+)CD69(+) phenotype) of healthy individuals, and effector CD27(-)CD45RA(-)PD-1(+)CD38(+)CD8(+) T cells in IAV/IBV patients. Our data show influenza-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in Indigenous Australians, and advocate for T-cell-mediated vaccines that target and boost the breadth of IAV/IBV-specific CD8(+) T cells to protect high-risk HLA-A*24:02-expressing Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations from severe influenza disease.
PXD024323	34006919	Comparative antler proteome of sika deer from different developmental stages. 	Profiling of sika deer antler proteins at different developmental stages based on label-free	antler, sika deer	Antler is a special bone tissue that has the ability to regenerate completely periodically. It is the fastest growing bone in the animal kingdom. Antler provides a valuable research model for bone growth and mineralization. Antler grows longitudinally by endochondral ossification with their growth center located in its tip. Many scholars have carried out detailed studies on morphology and gene expression of antler tip. However, few scholars have analyzed the protein expression patterns of antler tip at different development stages. This study used label-free proteomics approach to analyze the protein expression dynamics of the antler tip in six developmental periods (15, 25, 45, 65, 100 and 130 days after the previous antler cast) and costal cartilage. In result, 2052 proteins were confidently quantified, including 1937 antler proteins and 1044 costal cartilage proteins. Moreover, 913 antler core proteins and 132 antler-special proteins were obtained. Besides, the stages special proteins and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in different development stages were analyzed. A total of 875 DEPs were determined by one-way AVOVA. It is found that the growth period (15, 25, 45 and 65 days) showed more up-regulated protein including several chondrogenesis-associated proteins (collagen types II, collagen types XI, HAPLN1, PAPSS1 and PAPSS2). In ossification stages, the up-regulated proteins related with lysosome (CTSD, CTSB, MMP9, CAII) indicated that the antler has higher bone remodeling activity. Given the up-regulated expression of immune-related molecules (S100A7, CATHL7, LTF, AZU1, ELANE and MPO), we speculate that the local immune system may contribute to the ossification of antler tip. In conclusion, proteomics technology was used to deeply analyze the protein expression patterns of antler at different development stages. This provides a strong support for the research on the molecular regulation mechanism of rapid growth and ossification of velvet antler.
PXD023131	34008986	Characterization of Citrullination Sites in Neutrophils and Mast Cells Activated by Ionomycin via Integration of Mass Spectrometry and Machine Learning. 	Characterization of Citrullination Sites in Neutrophils and Mast Cells Activated by Ionomycin via Integration of Mass Spectrometry and Machine Learning	Citrullination, mast cells, neutrophils	Citrullination is an important post-translational modification implicated in many diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Neutrophil and mast cells have different expression profiles for protein-arginine deiminases (PADs), and ionomycin-induced activation makes them an ideal cellular model to study proteins susceptible to citrullination. We performed high-resolution mass spectrometry and stringent data filtration to identify citrullination sites in neutrophil and mast cells treated with and without ionomycin. We identified a total of 833 validated citrullination sites on 395 proteins. Several of these citrullinated proteins are important components of pathways involved in innate immune responses. Using this benchmark primary sequence data set, we developed machine learning models to predict citrullination in neutrophil and mast cell proteins. We show that our models predict citrullination likelihood with 0.735 and 0.766 AUCs (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves), respectively, on independent validation sets. In summary, this study provides the largest number of validated citrullination sites in neutrophil and mast cell proteins. The use of our novel motif analysis approach to predict citrullination sites will facilitate the discovery of novel protein substrates of protein-arginine deiminases (PADs), which may be key to understanding immunopathologies of various diseases.
PXD020445	34008989	Proteogenomics Study of Blastobotrys adeninivorans TMCC 70007-A Dominant Yeast in the Fermentation Process of Pu-erh Tea. 	Proteogenomics analysis of Blastobotrys adeninivorans TMCC 70007	Blastobotrys adeninivorans, Genome, Proteogenomic, Pu-erh tea	Blastobotrys adeninivorans plays an essential role in pile-fermenting of Pu-erh tea. Its ability to assimilate various carbon and nitrogen sources makes it available for application in a wide range of industry sectors. The genome of B. adeninivorans TMCC 70007 isolated from pile-fermented Pu-erh tea was sequenced and assembled. Proteomics analysis indicated that 4900 proteins in TMCC 70007 were expressed under various culture conditions. Proteogenomics mapping revealed 48 previously unknown genes and corrected 118 gene models predicted by GeneMark-ES. Ortho-proteogenomics analysis identified 17 previously unidentified genes in B. adeninivorans LS3, the first strain with a sequenced genome among the genus Blastobotrys as well. More importantly, five species specific genes were identified from TMCC 70007, which could serve as a barcode for strain typing and were applicable for fermentation process protection of this industrial species. The datasets generated from tea aqueous extract culture not only increased the proteome coverage and accuracy but also contributed to the identification of proteins related to polyphenols and caffeine, which were considered to change greatly during the microbial fermentation of Pu-erh tea. This study provides a proteome perspective on TMCC 70007, which was considered to be an important strain in the production of Pu-erh tea. The systematic proteogenomics analysis not only made a better annotation on the genome of B. adeninivorans TMCC 70007 as previous proteogenomics study but also provided solution for fermentation process protection on valuable industrial species with species specific genes uniquely identified from proteogenomics study.
PXD019435	34009990	Differential Membrane Protein Profile in Bovine X- and Y-Sperm. 	Differential Membrane Protein Profile in Sperm	Membrane proteomics, Sperm	The aim of this study was to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the biological differences of X- and Y-sperm and to screen the sex-specific candidate antigen proteins for sexed semen production. To this end, we investigated differential expression of total membrane proteins of the two sperm types by using high-purity X- and Y-sperm from 20 Holstein bulls and applying the label-free proteomic technique; 1521 proteins were identified. In the X-sperm group, 8 and 23 proteins were significantly up- and down-regulated, respectively. In the X- and the Y-sperm group, 151 and 88 proteins were specifically expressed, respectively. These were overexpressed in the dynamic changes of the actin cytoskeleton, and cell senescence/apoptosis induced by the immune response, and could result in differences in the state, size, and immune sensitivity of the X-/Y-sperm membranes. The prediction of transmembrane structure, subcellular localization, and Western blotting validation results showed that the CLRN3 and SCAMP1 proteins were cell surface specific antigens of X- and Y-sperm, respectively. Our findings help explain the molecular mechanism behind the biological differences of X-/Y-sperm and lay the foundation for application of immunological methods to produce sex-sorted semen and control livestock sex. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD019435.
PXD020140	34010456	Dual roles of HSP70 chaperone HSPA1 in quality control of nascent and newly synthesized proteins. 	Discovery of human breast cancer cell MCF7 heat induced proteins by LC-MS/MS	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Cancer (B/D-HPP), Heat shock response, Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Protein Misfolding and Aggregation (B/D-HPP), chaperones, proteasome	Exposure to heat stress triggers a well-defined acute response marked by HSF1-dependent transcriptional upregulation of heat shock proteins. Cells allowed to recover acquire thermotolerance, but this adaptation is poorly understood. By quantitative proteomics, we discovered selective upregulation of HSP70-family chaperone HSPA1 and its co-factors, HSPH1 and DNAJB1, in MCF7 breast cancer cells acquiring thermotolerance. HSPA1 was found to have dual function during heat stress response: (i) During acute stress, it promotes the recruitment of the 26S proteasome to translating ribosomes, thus poising cells for rapid protein degradation and resumption of protein synthesis upon recovery; (ii) during thermotolerance, HSPA1 together with HSPH1 maintains ubiquitylated nascent/newly synthesized proteins in a soluble state required for their efficient proteasomal clearance. Consistently, deletion of HSPH1 impedes thermotolerance and esophageal tumor growth in mice, thus providing a potential explanation for the poor prognosis of digestive tract cancers with high HSPH1 and nominating HSPH1 as a cancer drug target. We propose dual roles of HSPA1 either alone or in complex with HSPH1 and DNAJB1 in promoting quality control of nascent/newly synthesized proteins and cellular thermotolerance.
PXD024154	34011972	Cryo-EM reveals the architecture of placental malaria VAR2CSA and provides molecular insight into chondroitin sulfate binding. 	Mapping the binding site of VAR2CSA to chondroitin sulfate A	Chondoitin sulfate A, FPOP, HRPF, VAR2CSA	Placental malaria can have severe consequences for both mother and child and effective vaccines are lacking. Parasite-infected red blood cells sequester in the placenta through interaction between parasite-expressed protein VAR2CSA and the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate A (CS) abundantly present in the intervillous space. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the VAR2CSA ectodomain at up to 3.1 Aa resolution revealing an overall V-shaped architecture and a complex domain organization. Notably, the surface displays a single significantly electropositive patch, compatible with binding of negatively charged CS. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations as well as comparative hydroxyl radical protein foot-printing of VAR2CSA in complex with placental CS, we identify the CS-binding groove, intersecting with the positively charged patch of the central VAR2CSA structure. We identify distinctive conserved structural features upholding the macro-molecular domain complex and CS binding capacity of VAR2CSA as well as divergent elements possibly allowing immune escape at or near the CS binding site. These observations will support rational design of second-generation placental malaria vaccines.
PXD021785	34013174	Enhancing the chondrogenic potential of chondrogenic progenitor cells by deleting RAB5C. 	Enhancing the chondrogenic potential of chondrogenic progenitor cells by deletion of RAB5C	RAB5C, chondrogenic progenitor cells, osteoarthritis	Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disease that affects a large proportion of the elderly population. Chondrogenic progenitor cells (CPCs) reside in late-stage OA cartilage tissue, producing a fibrocartilaginous extracellular matrix; these cells can be manipulated in vitro to deposit proteins of healthy articular cartilage. CPCs are under the control of SOX9 and RUNX2. In our earlier studies, we showed that a knockdown of RUNX2 enhanced the chondrogenic potential of CPCs. Here we demonstrate that CPCs carrying a knockout of RAB5C, a protein involved in endosomal trafficking, exhibited elevated expression of multiple chondrogenic markers, including the SOX trio, and increased COL2 deposition, whereas no changes in COL1 deposition were observed. We report RAB5C as an attractive target for future therapeutic approaches designed to increase the COL2 content in the diseased joint.
PXD025817	34013269	CryoEM and AI reveal a structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp2, a multifunctional protein involved in key host processes. 	CryoEM and AI reveal a structure of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp2, a multifunctional protein involved in key host processes	APMS, Covid-19, CryoEM, Nsp2, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, SARS-CoV-2, artificial intelligence, protein-protein interactions	The SARS-CoV-2 protein Nsp2 has been implicated in a wide range of viral processes, but its exact functions, and the structural basis of those functions, remain unknown. Here, we report an atomic model for full-length Nsp2 obtained by combining cryo-electron microscopy with deep learning-based structure prediction from AlphaFold2. The resulting structure reveals a highly-conserved zinc ion-binding site, suggesting a role for Nsp2 in RNA binding. Mapping emerging mutations from variants of SARS-CoV-2 on the resulting structure shows potential host-Nsp2 interaction regions. Using structural analysis together with affinity tagged purification mass spectrometry experiments, we identify Nsp2 mutants that are unable to interact with the actin-nucleation-promoting WASH protein complex or with GIGYF2, an inhibitor of translation initiation and modulator of ribosome-associated quality control. Our work suggests a potential role of Nsp2 in linking viral transcription within the viral replication-transcription complexes (RTC) to the translation initiation of the viral message. Collectively, the structure reported here, combined with mutant interaction mapping, provides a foundation for functional studies of this evolutionary conserved coronavirus protein and may assist future drug design.
PXD025130	34013402	Heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 virus produced in cell culture revealed by shotgun proteomics and supported by genome sequencing. 	Proteomics characterization of purified SARS-CoV-2 viral particles for search of mutations.	COVID-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, mutations, variants, virus	COVID-19 is the most disturbing pandemic of the past hundred years. Its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been the subject of an unprecedented investigation to characterize its molecular structure and intimate functioning. While markers for its detection have been proposed and several diagnostic methodologies developed, its propensity to evolve and evade diagnostic tools and the immune response is of great concern. The recent spread of new variants with increased infectivity requires even more attention. Here, we document how shotgun proteomics can be useful for rapidly monitoring the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We evaluated the heterogeneity of purified SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained after culturing in the Vero E6 cell line. We found that cell culture induces significant changes that are translated at the protein level, such changes being detectable by tandem mass spectrometry. Production of viral particles requires careful quality control which can be easily performed by shotgun proteomics. Although considered relatively stable so far, the SARS-CoV-2 genome turns out to be prone to frequent variations. Therefore, the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 variants from patients reporting only the consensus genome after its amplification would deserve more attention and could benefit from more in-depth analysis of low level but crystal-clear signals, as well as complementary and rapid analysis by shotgun proteomics.
PXD024671	34015255	The structural heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein is governed by several distinct subpopulations with interconversion times slower than milliseconds. 	The structural heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein is governed by several distinct subpopulations with interconversion times slower than milliseconds	CL-MS, molecular dynamics., trFRET, alpha-Synuclein monomer	alpha-Synuclein plays an important role in synaptic functions by interacting with synaptic vesicle membrane, while its oligomers and fibrils are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. The specific monomer structures that promote its membrane binding and self-association remain elusive due to its transient nature as an intrinsically disordered protein. Here, we use inter-dye distance distributions from bulk time-resolved Foerster resonance energy transfer as restraints in discrete molecular dynamics simulations to map the conformational space of the alpha-synuclein monomer. We further confirm the generated conformational ensemble in orthogonal experiments utilizing far-UV circular dichroism and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Single-molecule protein-induced fluorescence enhancement measurements show that within this conformational ensemble, some of the conformations of alpha-synuclein are surprisingly stable, exhibiting conformational transitions slower than milliseconds. Our comprehensive analysis of the conformational ensemble reveals essential structural properties and potential conformations that promote its various functions in membrane interaction or oligomer and fibril formation.
PXD023211	34015258	Multiplexed complexome profiling using tandem mass tags. 	Multiplexed complexome profiling using tandem mass tags	Complexome profiling, Tandem mass tags, multiplexed complexomics, protein complexes	Complexome profiling is a rapidly spreading, powerful technique to gain insight into the nature of protein complexes. It identifies and quantifies protein complexes separated into multiple fractions of increasing molecular mass using mass spectrometry-based, label-free bottom-up proteomics. Complexome profiling enables a sophisticated and thorough characterization of the composition, molecular mass, assembly, and interactions of protein complexes. However, in practice, its application is limited by the large number of samples it generates and the related time of mass spectrometry analyses. Here, we report an improved process workflow that implements tandem mass tags for multiplexing complexome profiling. This workflow substantially reduces the number of samples and measuring time without compromising protein identification or quantification reliability. In profiles from mitochondrial fractions of cells recovering from chloramphenicol treatment, tandem mass tags-multiplexed complexome profiling exhibited migration patterns of mature ATP synthase (complex V) and assembly intermediates that were consistent in composition and abundance with profiles obtained by the label-free approach. Reporter ion quantifications of proteins and complexes unaffected by the chloramphenicol treatment presented less variation in comparison to the label-free method. Incorporation of tandem mass tags enabled an efficient and robust complexome profiling analysis and may foster broader application for protein complex profiling in biomedical research and diagnostics.
PXD014889	34015498	Effects of TDP-43 overexpression on neuron proteome and morphology in vitro. 	Effect of TDP-43 overexpression on neuron structure, function and proteome in vitro	Neuroproteomics, TDP-43, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cytoskeleton	TDP-43 is pathologically and genetically with associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. These diseases are characterized by significant neurite defects, including cytoskeletal pathology. The involvement of TDP-43 in the degeneration of neurons in these diseases are not yet well understood, however accumulating evidence shows involvement in neurite outgrowth, remodelling and in regulation of many components of the neuronal cytoskeleton. In order to investigate how alterations to TDP-43 expression levels may exert effects on the neuronal cytoskeleton, primary cortical neurons from transgenic mice overexpressing one or two copies of human wildtype TDP-43 under the prion promoter were examined. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis, followed by functional annotation clustering to identify protein families that clustered together within up- or down-regulated protein groups, revealed that actin-binding proteins were significantly more abundant in neurons overexpressing TDP-43 compared to wildtype neurons. Morphological analysis demonstrated that during early development neurons expressing one copy of human TDP-43 had an increased number of neurite branches and alterations to growth cone morphology, while no changes were observed in neurons expressing two copies of TDP-43. These developmental processes require specific expression and organization of the cytoskeleton. The results from these studies provide further insight into the normal function of TDP-43 and how alterations in TDP-43 expression may impact the cytoskeleton.
PXD011469	34015711	Threonine dehydratase enhances bacterial cadmium resistance via driving cysteine desulfuration and biomineralization of cadmium sulfide nanocrystals. 	Threonine dehydratase couples L-cysteine metabolism to cadmium resistance in Pseudomonas stutzeri 273 through cadmium sulfide nanoparticle biomineralization	Mutants, Pseudomonas stutzeri 273, qRT-PCR	Biomineralization is often used by microorganisms to sequester heavy metal ions and provides a potential means for remediating increasing levels of heavy metal pollution. Bacteria have been shown to utilize cysteine for the biomineralization of metal sulfide. Indeed, in the present study, the supplement of L-cysteine was found to significantly improve both cadmium resistance and removal abilities of a deep-sea bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri 273 through cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanoparticle biomineralization. With a proteomic approach, threonine dehydratase of P. stutzeri 273 (psTD) was proposed to be a key factor enhancing bacterial cadmium resistance through catalyzing L-cysteine desulfuration, H2S generation and CdS nanoparticle biomineralization. Consistently, deletion of the gene encoding psTD in P. stutzeri 273 resulted in the decline of H2S generation, decrease of cadmium resistance, and reduction of cadmium removal ability, confirming the unique function of psTD directing the formation of CdS nanoparticles. Correspondingly, the single-enzyme biomineralization of CdS nanoparticle driven by psTD was further developed, and psTD was shown to act as a capping reagent for the mineralization reaction, which controlling the size and structure of nanocrystals. Our results provide important clues for the construction of engineered bacteria for cadmium bioremediation and widen the synthesis methods of nanomaterials.
PXD025126	34016558	Lack of CFTR alters the ferret pancreatic ductal epithelial secretome and cellular proteome: Implications for exocrine/endocrine signaling. 	Secretome and Proteome of WT and CFTR-KO pancreatic duct epithelial cells	Cystic Fibrosis, Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes, ductal cells, pancreas, secretome	BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) related diabetes is the most common comorbidity for CF patients and associated with islet dysfunction. Exocrine pancreas remodeling in CF alters the microenvironment in which islets reside. Since CFTR is mainly expressed in pancreatic ductal epithelium, we hypothesized altered CF ductal secretions could impact islet function through paracrine signals. METHOD: We evaluated the secretome and cellular proteome of polarized WT and CF ferret ductal epithelia using quantitative ratiometric mass spectrometry. Differentially secreted proteins (DSPs) or expressed cellular proteins were used to mine pathways, upstream regulators and the CFTR interactome to map candidate CF-associated alterations in ductal signaling and phenotype. Candidate DSPs were evaluated for their in vivo pancreatic expression patterns and their functional impact on islet hormone secretion. RESULTS: The secretome and cellular proteome of CF ductal epithelia was significantly altered relative to WT and implicated dysregulated TGFbeta, WNT, and BMP signaling pathways. Cognate receptors of DSPs from CF epithelia were equally distributed among endocrine, exocrine, and stromal pancreatic cell types. IGFBP7 was a downregulated DSP in CF ductal epithelia in vitro and exhibited reduced CF ductal expression in vivo. IGFBP7 also altered WT islet insulin secretion in response to glucose. Many CFTR-associated proteins, including SLC9A3R1, were differentially expressed in the CF cellular proteome. Upstream regulators of the differential CF ductal proteome included TGFbeta, PDX1, AKT/PTEN, and INSR signaling. Data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025126. CONCLUSION: These findings provide a proteomic roadmap for elucidating disturbances in autocrine and paracrine signals from CF pancreatic ducts and how they may alter islet function and maintenance.
PXD020284	34016623	Quantitative Analysis of Tyrosine Phosphorylation from FFPE Tissues Reveals Patient-Specific Signaling Networks. 	Quantitative analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation from FFPE tissues reveals patient specific signaling networks	Afatinib, FFPE, Phosphotyrosine	Human tissue samples commonly preserved as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues after diagnostic or surgical procedures in the clinic represent an invaluable source of clinical specimens for in-depth characterization of signaling networks to assess therapeutic options. Tyrosine phosphorylation (pTyr) plays a fundamental role in cellular processes and is commonly dysregulated in cancer but has not been studied to date in FFPE samples. In addition, pTyr analysis that may otherwise inform therapeutic interventions for patients has been limited by the requirement for large amounts of frozen tissue. Here we describe a method for highly sensitive, quantitative analysis of pTyr signaling networks, with hundreds of sites quantified from one to two 10-mum sections of FFPE tissue specimens. A combination of optimized magnetic bead-based sample processing, optimized pTyr enrichment strategies, and tandem mass tag multiplexing enabled in-depth coverage of pTyr signaling networks from small amounts of input material. Phosphotyrosine profiles of flash-frozen and FFPE tissues derived from the same tumors suggested that FFPE tissues preserve pTyr signaling characteristics in patient-derived xenografts and archived clinical specimens. pTyr analysis of FFPE tissue sections from breast cancer tumors as well as lung cancer tumors highlighted patient-specific oncogenic driving kinases, indicating potential targeted therapies for each patient. These data suggest the capability for direct translational insight from pTyr analysis of small amounts of FFPE tumor tissue specimens. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reports a highly sensitive method utilizing FFPE tissues to identify dysregulated signaling networks in patient tumors, opening the door for direct translational insights from FFPE tumor tissue banks in hospitals.
PXD023577	34017973	Deciphering the architecture and interactome of hnRNP proteins and enigmRBPs. 	Deciphering the architecture and interactome of the spliceosomal C complex using in vivo chemical crosslinking	RNA-binding proteins, chemical cross-linking, interactome, nuclear hnRNPs, protein interaction reporter, splicing	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have conserved domains and consensus sequences that interact with RNAs and other proteins forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. RNPs are involved in the regulation of several cellular processes, including transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA transport, localization, degradation and storage, and ultimately control of translation. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) comprise a family of RBPs that mediate transcription control and nuclear processing of transcripts. Some hnRNPs are part of the spliceosome complex, a dynamic machinery formed by RNPs that regulate alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. Here, chemical crosslinking of proteins was applied to identify specific interacting regions and protein structural features of hnRNPs: hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2/B1, hnRNPC, and RALY. The results reveal interaction of these proteins within RNA-binding domains and conserved motifs, providing evidence of a coordinated action of known regulatory sequences of RBPs. Moreover, these crosslinking data enable structural model generation for RBPs, illustrating how crosslinking mass spectrometry can complement other structural methods.
PXD025172	34018207	Structural basis of TRAPPIII-mediated Rab1 activation. 	Yeast TRAPPIII complex cross-linking mass spectrometry	TRAPP, cross-linking mass spectrometry	The GTPase Rab1 is a master regulator of the early secretory pathway and is critical for autophagy. Rab1 activation is controlled by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the multisubunit TRAPPIII complex. Here, we report the 3.7 Aa cryo-EM structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TRAPPIII complex bound to its substrate Rab1/Ypt1. The structure reveals the binding site for the Rab1/Ypt1 hypervariable domain, leading to a model for how the complex interacts with membranes during the activation reaction. We determined that stable membrane binding by the TRAPPIII complex is required for robust activation of Rab1/Ypt1 in vitro and in vivo, and is mediated by a conserved amphipathic alpha-helix within the regulatory Trs85 subunit. Our results show that the Trs85 subunit serves as a membrane anchor, via its amphipathic helix, for the entire TRAPPIII complex. These findings provide a structural understanding of Rab activation on organelle and vesicle membranes.
PXD025064	34018214	Cryo-EM structure of metazoan TRAPPIII, the multi-subunit complex that activates the GTPase Rab1. 	A cryo-EM structure of metazoan TRAPPIII, the multisubunit complex that activates the GTPase Rab1	Exchange factor / Rab1 / autophagy / membrane traffic / Golgi	The TRAPP complexes are nucleotide exchange factors that play essential roles in membrane traffic and autophagy. TRAPPII activates Rab11, and TRAPPIII activates Rab1, with the two complexes sharing a core of small subunits that affect nucleotide exchange but being distinguished by specific large subunits that are essential for activity in vivo. Crystal structures of core subunits have revealed the mechanism of Rab activation, but how the core and the large subunits assemble to form the complexes is unknown. We report a cryo-EM structure of the entire Drosophila TRAPPIII complex. The TRAPPIII-specific subunits TRAPPC8 and TRAPPC11 hold the catalytic core like a pair of tongs, with TRAPPC12 and TRAPPC13 positioned at the joint between them. TRAPPC2 and TRAPPC2L link the core to the two large arms, with the interfaces containing residues affected by disease-causing mutations. The TRAPPC8 arm is positioned such that it would contact Rab1 that is bound to the core, indicating how the arm could determine the specificity of the complex. A lower resolution structure of TRAPPII shows a similar architecture and suggests that the TRAPP complexes evolved from a single ur-TRAPP.
PXD022718	34019113	Optimisation of xylanases production by two Cellulomonas strains and their use for biomass deconstruction. 	Cellulomonas sp. B6 and C. fimi B-402 secretomes xylanases	Cellulomonas, enzymatic hydrolysis, lignocellulose, lyophilisation, secretome analysis, waste valorisation	One of the main distinguishing features of bacteria belonging to the Cellulomonas genus is their ability to secrete multiple polysaccharide degrading enzymes. However, their application in biomass deconstruction still constitutes a challenge. We addressed the optimisation of the xylanolytic activities in extracellular enzymatic extracts of Cellulomonas sp. B6 and Cellulomonas fimi B-402 for their subsequent application in lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis by culture in several substrates. As demonstrated by secretomic profiling, wheat bran and waste paper resulted to be suitable inducers for the secretion of xylanases of Cellulomonas sp. B6 and C. fimi B-402, respectively. Both strains showed high xylanolytic activity in culture supernatant although Cellulomonas sp. B6 was the most efficient xylanolytic strain. Upscaling from flasks to fermentation in a bench scale bioreactor resulted in equivalent production of extracellular xylanolytic enzymatic extracts and freeze drying was a successful method for concentration and conservation of the extracellular enzymes, retaining 80% activity. Moreover, enzymatic cocktails composed of combined extra and intracellular extracts effectively hydrolysed the hemicellulose fraction of extruded barley straw into xylose and xylooligosaccharides. KEY POINTS: * Secreted xylanase activity of Cellulomonas sp. B6 and C. fimi was maximised. * Biomass-induced extracellular enzymes were identified by proteomic profiling. * Combinations of extra and intracellular extracts were used for barley straw hydrolysis.
PXD022167	34019426	Affinity Purification-Mass Spectrometry Identifies a Novel Interaction between a Polerovirus and a Conserved Innate Immunity Aphid Protein that Regulates Transmission Efficiency. 	Isolation of aphid-Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) proteins complexes from viruliferous insects using affinity purification-mass spectrometry	AP-MS., Luteoviridae, Myzus persicae, PLRV, Potato leafroll virus, aphid, circulative transmission, phloem-limited plant virus, polerovirus, potato pathogen	The vast majority of plant viruses are transmitted by insect vectors, with many crucial aspects of the transmission process being mediated by key protein-protein interactions. Still, very few vector proteins interacting with viruses have been identified and functionally characterized. Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) is transmitted most efficiently by Myzus persicae, the green peach aphid, in a circulative, non-propagative manner. Using affinity purification coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (AP-MS), we identified 11 proteins from M. persicaedisplaying a high probability of interaction with PLRV and an additional 23 vector proteins with medium confidence interaction scores. Three of these aphid proteins were confirmed to directly interact with the structural proteins of PLRV and other luteovirid species via yeast two-hybrid. Immunolocalization of one of these direct PLRV-interacting proteins, an orthologue of the human innate immunity protein complement component 1 Q subcomponent-binding protein (C1QBP), shows that MpC1QBP partially co-localizes with PLRV in cytoplasmic puncta and along the periphery of aphid gut epithelial cells. Artificial diet delivery to aphids of a chemical inhibitor of C1QBP leads to increased PLRV acquisition by aphids and subsequently increased titer in inoculated plants, supporting a role for C1QBP in the acquisition and transmission efficiency of PLRV by M. persicae. This study presents the first use of AP-MS for the in vivo isolation of a functionally relevant insect vector-virus protein complex. MS data are available from ProteomeXchange.org using the project identifier PXD022167.
PXD019009	34021002	Proteomic Screens for Suppressors of Anoikis Identify IL1RAP as a Promising Surface Target in Ewing Sarcoma. 	IL1RAP augments cysteine metabolism to promote ferroptosis resistance and metastasis in Ewing sarcoma	Ewing sarcoma, IL1RAP, TMT, cysteine metabolism	Cancer cells must overcome anoikis (detachment-induced death) to successfully metastasize. Using proteomic screens, we found that distinct oncoproteins upregulate IL1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) to suppress anoikis. IL1RAP is directly induced by oncogenic fusions of Ewing sarcoma, a highly metastatic childhood sarcoma. IL1RAP inactivation triggers anoikis and impedes metastatic dissemination of Ewing sarcoma cells. Mechanistically, IL1RAP binds the cell-surface system Xc (-) transporter to enhance exogenous cystine uptake, thereby replenishing cysteine and the glutathione antioxidant. Under cystine depletion, IL1RAP induces cystathionine gamma lyase (CTH) to activate the transsulfuration pathway for de novo cysteine synthesis. Therefore, IL1RAP maintains cyst(e)ine and glutathione pools, which are vital for redox homeostasis and anoikis resistance. IL1RAP is minimally expressed in pediatric and adult normal tissues, and human anti-IL1RAP antibodies induce potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of Ewing sarcoma cells. Therefore, we define IL1RAP as a new cell-surface target in Ewing sarcoma, which is potentially exploitable for immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we identify cell-surface protein IL1RAP as a key driver of metastasis in Ewing sarcoma, a highly aggressive childhood sarcoma. Minimal expression in pediatric and adult normal tissues nominates IL1RAP as a promising target for immunotherapy.See related commentary by Yoon and DeNicola, p. 2679.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 2659.
PXD024194	34022224	CSE1L promotes nuclear accumulation of transcriptional coactivator TAZ and enhances invasiveness of human cancer cells. 	Identification of TI-4-interacting proteins	Homo sapiens, TAZ, TI-4	The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) (WWTR1) induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhances drug resistance in multiple cancers. TAZ has been shown to interact with transcription factors in the nucleus, but when phosphorylated, translocates to the cytoplasm and is degraded through proteasomes. Here, we identified a compound TAZ inhibitor 4 (TI-4) that shifted TAZ localization to the cytoplasm independently of its phosphorylation. We used affinity beads to ascertain a putative target of TI-4, chromosomal segregation 1 like (CSE1L), which is known to be involved in the recycling of importin alpha and as a biomarker of cancer malignancy. We found that TI-4 suppressed TAZ-mediated transcription in a CSE1L-dependent manner. CSE1L overexpression increased nuclear levels of TAZ, whereas CSE1L silencing delayed its nuclear import. We also found via the in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments that TI-4 strengthened the interaction between CSE1L and importin alpha5 and blocked the binding of importin alpha5 to TAZ. WWTR1 silencing attenuated CSE1L-promoted colony formation, motility, and invasiveness of human lung cancer and glioblastoma cells. Conversely, CSE1L silencing blocked TAZ-promoted colony formation, motility, and invasiveness in human lung cancer and glioblastoma cells. In human cancer tissues, the expression level of CSE1L was found to correlate with nuclear levels of TAZ. These findings support that CSE1L promotes the nuclear accumulation of TAZ and enhances malignancy in cancer cells.
PXD025300	34022432	Revealing the Dynamic Allosteric Changes Required for Formation of the Cysteine Synthase Complex by Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange MS. 	Revealing the dynamic allosteric changes required for formation of the cysteine synthase complex by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry	Cysteine biosynthesis, E. coli, Hydrogen deuterium exchange (hdx-ms), Synapt G2-Si, allosteric regulation, bienzyme complex, cysteine synthase, protein-protein interactions	CysE and CysK, the last two enzymes of the cysteine biosynthetic pathway, engage in a bienzyme complex, cysteine synthase, with yet incompletely characterized three-dimensional structure and regulatory function. Being absent in mammals, the two enzymes and their complex are attractive targets for antibacterial drugs. We have used hydrogen/deuterium exchange MS to unveil how complex formation affects the conformational dynamics of CysK and CysE. Our results support a model where CysE is present in solution as a dimer of trimers, and each trimer can bind one CysK homodimer. When CysK binds to one CysE monomer, intratrimer allosteric communication ensures conformational and dynamic symmetry within the trimer. Furthermore, a long-range allosteric signal propagates through CysE to induce stabilization of the interface between the two CysE trimers, preparing the second trimer for binding the second CysK with a nonrandom orientation. These results provide new molecular insights into the allosteric formation of the cysteine synthase complex and could help guide antibacterial drug design.
PXD018148	34022944	Quantitative proteomic comparison of salt stress in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the snow alga Chlamydomonas nivalis reveals mechanisms for salt-triggered fatty acid accumulation via reallocation of carbon resources. 	¬¬Quantitative proteomic comparison of salt stress in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and snow alga Chlamydomonas nivalis reveals mechanisms for salt-triggered lipid accumulation via reallocation of carbon resources	Biofuel, Chlamydomonas nivalis, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Lipid production, Salt stress, iTRAQ, quantitative proteomics	BACKGROUND: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model green alga strain for molecular studies; its fully sequenced genome has enabled omic-based analyses that have been applied to better understand its metabolic responses to stress. Here, we characterised physiological and proteomic changes between a low-starch C. reinhardtii strain and the snow alga Chlamydomonas nivalis, to reveal insights into their contrasting responses to salinity stress. RESULTS: Each strain was grown in conditions tailored to their growth requirements to encourage maximal fatty acid (as a proxy measure of lipid) production, with internal controls to allow comparison points. In 0.2 M NaCl, C. nivalis accumulates carbohydrates up to 10.4% DCW at 80 h, and fatty acids up to 52.0% dry cell weight (DCW) over 12 days, however, C. reinhardtii does not show fatty acid accumulation over time, and shows limited carbohydrate accumulation up to 5.5% DCW. Analysis of the C. nivalis fatty acid profiles showed that salt stress improved the biofuel qualities over time. Photosynthesis and respiration rates are reduced in C. reinhardtii relative to C. nivalis in response to 0.2 M NaCl. De novo sequencing and homology matching was used in conjunction with iTRAQ-based quantitative analysis to identify and relatively quantify proteomic alterations in cells exposed to salt stress. There were abundance differences in proteins associated with stress, photosynthesis, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism proteins. In terms of lipid synthesis, salt stress induced an increase in dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase in C. nivalis (1.1-fold change), whilst levels in C. reinhardtii remained unaffected; this enzyme is involved in acetyl CoA production and has been linked to TAG accumulation in microalgae. In salt-stressed C. nivalis there were decreases in the abundance of UDP-sulfoquinovose (- 1.77-fold change), which is involved in sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol metabolism, and in citrate synthase (- 2.7-fold change), also involved in the TCA cycle. Decreases in these enzymes have been shown to lead to increased TAG production as fatty acid biosynthesis is favoured. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD018148. CONCLUSIONS: These differences in protein abundance have given greater understanding of the mechanism by which salt stress promotes fatty acid accumulation in the un-sequenced microalga C. nivalis as it switches to a non-growth state, whereas C. reinhardtii does not have this response.
PXD024083	34023516	Influence of dietary Spirulina inclusion and lysozyme supplementation on the longissimus lumborum muscle proteome of newly weaned piglets. 	TMT-based proteomics of longissimus lumborum muscle in newly weaned piglets after dietary Spirulina inclusion and enzyme supplementation	CAZyme, Spirulina, muscle proteome, tandem mass tag, weaned piglet	Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina) is a microalga with a high content of crude protein. It has a recalcitrant cell wall that limits the accessibility of the animal endogenous enzymes to its intracellular nutrients. Enzymatic supplementation aiming to degrade cell walls could benefit microalgae digestibility. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of dietary Spirulina and lysozyme supplementation over the muscle proteome of piglets during the post-weaning stage. Thirty piglets were randomly distributed among three diets: control (no microalga), SP (10% Spirulina) and SP + L (10% Spirulina +0.01% lysozyme). After 4 weeks, they were sacrificed and samples of the longissimus lumborum muscle were taken. The muscle proteome was analysed using a Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based quantitative approach. A total of 832 proteins were identified. Three comparisons were computed: SP vs Ctrl, SP + L vs Ctrl and SP + L vs SP. They had ten, four and twelve differentially abundant proteins. Glycogen metabolism and nutrient reserves utilization are increased in the SP piglets. Structural muscle protein synthesis increased, causing higher energy requirements in SP + L piglets. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of proteomics to disclose the effect of dietary microalgae, whilst unveiling putative mechanisms derived from lysozyme supplementation. Data available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD024083. SIGNIFICANCE: Spirulina, a microalga, is an alternative to conventional crops which could enhance the environmental sustainability of animal production. Due to its recalcitrant cell wall, its use requires additional measures to prevent anti-nutritional effects on the feeding of piglets in the post-weaning period, during which they endure post-weaning stress. One of such measures could be CAZyme supplementation to help degrade the cell wall during digestion. Muscle proteomics provides insightful data on the effect of dietary microalgae and enzyme activity on piglet metabolism.
PXD023942	34023904	SANS (USH1G) regulates pre-mRNA splicing by mediating the intra-nuclear transfer of tri-snRNP complexes. 	SANS (USH1G) regulates pre-mRNA splicing by mediating the intra-nuclear transfer of tri-snRNP complexes	Cajal bodies, Usher Syndrome, alternative splicing, ciliopathy, intra-nuclear transport, nuclear speckles, spliceosome	Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a compositionally dynamic complex assembled stepwise on pre-mRNA. We reveal links between splicing machinery components and the intrinsically disordered ciliopathy protein SANS. Pathogenic mutations in SANS/USH1G lead to Usher syndrome-the most common cause of deaf-blindness. Previously, SANS was shown to function only in the cytosol and primary cilia. Here, we have uncovered molecular links between SANS and pre-mRNA splicing catalyzed by the spliceosome in the nucleus. We show that SANS is found in Cajal bodies and nuclear speckles, where it interacts with components of spliceosomal sub-complexes such as SF3B1 and the large splicing cofactor SON but also with PRPFs and snRNAs related to the tri-snRNP complex. SANS is required for the transfer of tri-snRNPs between Cajal bodies and nuclear speckles for spliceosome assembly and may also participate in snRNP recycling back to Cajal bodies. SANS depletion alters the kinetics of spliceosome assembly, leading to accumulation of complex A. SANS deficiency and USH1G pathogenic mutations affects splicing of genes related to cell proliferation and human Usher syndrome. Thus, we provide the first evidence that splicing dysregulation may participate in the pathophysiology of Usher syndrome.
PXD014422	34024016	Proteome Analysis of PC12 Cells Reveals Alterations in Translation Regulation and Actin Signaling Induced by Clozapine. 	Proteome analysis of PC12 cells reveals alterations in translation regulation and actin signalling induced by clozapine	Actin signalling, Clozapine, Translation, mTOR	Although antipsychotics are routinely used in the treatment of schizophrenia for the last decades, their precise mechanism of action is still unclear. In this study, we investigated changes in the PC12 cells' proteome under the influence of clozapine, risperidone, and haloperidol to identify protein pathways regulated by antipsychotics. Analysis of the protein profiles in two time points: after 12 and 24 h of incubation with drugs revealed significant alterations in 510 proteins. Further canonical pathway analysis revealed an inhibition of ciliary trophic factor signaling after treatment with haloperidol and showed a decrease in acute phase response signaling in the risperidone group. Interestingly, all tested drugs have caused changes in PC12 proteome which correspond to inhibition of cytokines: tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1). We also found that the 12-h incubation with clozapine caused up-regulation of protein kinase A signaling and translation machinery. After 24 h of treatment with clozapine, the inhibition of the actin cytoskeleton signaling and Rho proteins signaling was revealed. The obtained results suggest that the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2) play a central role in the signal transduction of clozapine.
PXD060240	34025711	Proteomics Landscape of Host-Pathogen Interaction in Acinetobacter baumannii Infected Mouse Lung. 	In-situ proximity labeling of proteins associated with specific circRNA and RNA G-quadruplex	RNA-binding protein, proximity labeling, target RNA	Acinetobacter baumannii is an important pathogen of nosocomial infection worldwide, which can primarily cause pneumonia, bloodstream infection, and urinary tract infection. The increasing drug resistance rate of A. baumannii and the slow development of new antibacterial drugs brought great challenges for clinical treatment. Host immunity is crucial to the defense of A. baumannii infection, and understanding the mechanisms of immune response can facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies. To characterize the system-level changes of host proteome in immune response, we used tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling quantitative proteomics to compare the proteome changes of lungs from A. baumannii infected mice with control mice 6 h after infection. A total of 6,218 proteins were identified in which 6,172 could be quantified. With threshold p < 0.05 and relative expression fold change > 1.2 or < 0.83, we found 120 differentially expressed proteins. Bioinformatics analysis showed that differentially expressed proteins after infection were associated with receptor recognition, NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation and antimicrobial peptides. These differentially expressed proteins were involved in the pathways including leukocyte transendothelial migration, phagocyte, neutrophil degranulation, and antimicrobial peptides. In conclusion, our study showed proteome changes in mouse lung tissue due to A. baumannii infection and suggested the important roles of NOX, neutrophils, and antimicrobial peptides in host response. Our results provide a potential list of protein candidates for the further study of host-bacteria interaction in A. baumannii infection. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD020640.
PXD023379	34025939	N-glycome and N-glycoproteome of a hematophagous parasitic nematode Haemonchus. 	N-Glycome and N-Glycoproteome of a Hematophagous Parasitic Nematode Haemonchus	Haemonchus contortus, N-glycan, N-glycosylation, glycopeptide	N-glycosylation is a physiologically vital post-translational modification of proteins in eukaryotic organisms. Initial work on Haemonchus contortus - a blood-sucking nematode of ruminants with a broad geographical distribution - has shown that this parasite harbors N-glycans with exclusive chitobiose modifications. Besides, several immunogenic proteins (e.g., amino- and metallo-peptidases) are known to be N-glycosylated in adult worms. However, an informative atlas of N-glycosylation in H. contortus is not yet available. Herein, we report 291 N-glycosylated proteins with a total of 425 modification sites in the parasite. Among them, many peptidase families (e.g., peptidase C1 and M1) including potential vaccine targets were enriched. Notably, the glycan-rich conjugates are distributed primarily in the intestine and gonads of adult worms, and consequently hidden from the host's immune system. Collectively, these data provide a comprehensive atlas of N-glycosylation in a prevalent parasitic nematode while underlining its significance for infection, immunity and prevention.
PXD023192	34026826	The Universally Conserved ATPase YchF Regulates Translation of Leaderless mRNA in Response to Stress Conditions. 	The universally conserved ATPase YchF regulates translation of leaderless mRNA in response to stress conditions	bacteria, site-directed in vivo photo cross-linking	The universally conserved P-loop GTPases control diverse cellular processes, like signal transduction, ribosome assembly, cell motility, and intracellular transport and translation. YchF belongs to the Obg-family of P-loop GTPases and is one of the least characterized member of this family. It is unique because it preferentially hydrolyses ATP rather than GTP, but its physiological role is largely unknown. Studies in different organisms including humans suggest a possible role of YchF in regulating the cellular adaptation to stress conditions. In the current study, we explored the role of YchF in the model organism Escherichia coli. By western blot and promoter fusion experiments, we demonstrate that YchF levels decrease during stress conditions or when cells enter stationary phase. The decline in YchF levels trigger increased stress resistance and cells lacking YchF are resistant to multiple stress conditions, like oxidative stress, replication stress, or translational stress. By in vivo site directed cross-linking we demonstrate that YchF interacts with the translation initiation factor 3 (IF3) and with multiple ribosomal proteins at the surface of the small ribosomal subunit. The absence of YchF enhances the anti-association activity of IF3, stimulates the translation of leaderless mRNAs, and increases the resistance against the endoribonuclease MazF, which generates leaderless mRNAs during stress conditions. In summary, our data identify YchF as a stress-responsive regulator of leaderless mRNA translation.
PXD023704	34027671	Retinal Proteomics of a Mouse Model of Dystroglycanopathies Reveals Molecular Alterations in Photoreceptors. 	Retinal proteomics of a mouse model of dystroglycanopathies shows changes in different photoreceptor regions	dystroglycanopathies, mouse model, photoreceptor	Mutations in the POMT1 gene, encoding a protein O-mannosyltransferase essential for alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG) glycosylation, are frequently observed in a group of rare congenital muscular dystrophies, collectively known as dystroglycanopathies. However, it is hitherto unclear whether the effects seen in affected patients can be fully ascribed to alpha-DG hypoglycosylation. To study this, here we used comparative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and immunofluorescence microscopy and investigated the changes in the retina of mice in which Pomt1 is specifically knocked out in photoreceptor cells. Our results demonstrate significant proteomic changes and associated structural alteration in photoreceptor cells of Pomt1 cKO mice. In addition to the effects related to impaired alpha-DG O-mannosylation, we observed morphological alterations in the outer segment that are associated with dysregulation of a relatively understudied POMT1 substrate (KIAA1549), BBSome proteins, and retinal stress markers. In conclusion, our study provides new hypotheses to explain the phenotypic changes that are observed in the retina of patients with dystroglycanopathies.
PXD025105	34028182	Mapping the interaction between eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) and the inhibitor hippuristanol using carbene footprinting and mass spectrometry. 	Mapping the Interaction between Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 4A (eIF4A) and the Inhibitor Hippuristanol Using Carbene Footprinting and Mass Spectrometry	Carbene labelling, mapping ligand binding, protein footprinting	Protein-ligand interactions are central to protein activity and cell functionality. Improved knowledge of these relationships greatly benefits our understanding of key biological processes and aids in rational drug design towards the treatment of clinically relevant diseases. Carbene footprinting is a recently developed mass spectrometry-based chemical labelling technique that provides valuable information relating to protein-ligand interactions, such as the mapping of binding sites and associated conformational change. Here, we show the application of carbene footprinting to the interaction between eIF4A helicase and a natural product inhibitor, hippuristanol, found in the coral Isis hippuris. Upon addition of hippuristanol we identified reduced carbene labelling (masking) in regions of eIF4A previously implicated in ligand binding. Additionally, we detected hippuristanol-associated increased carbene labelling (unmasking) around the flexible hinge region of eIF4A, indicating ligand-induced conformational change. This work represents further development of the carbene footprinting technique and demonstrates its potential in characterising medicinally relevant protein-ligand interactions.
PXD023495	34029081	Tracking Gluten throughout Brewing Using N-Terminal Labeling Mass Spectrometry. 	Tracking Gluten throughout Brewing Using N-Terminal Labeling Mass Spectrometry	Gluten, barley, beer, brewing, celiac disease, fermentation, gliadin, wheat	Gluten-containing grains cause adverse health effects in individuals with celiac disease. Fermentation of these grains results in gluten-derived polypeptides with largely uncharacterized sizes and sequences, which may still trigger an immune response. This research used N-terminal labeling mass spectrometry to characterize protein hydrolysates during each stage of bench-scale brewing, including malting, mashing, boiling, fermentation, and aging. Gluten hydrolysates from each brewing step were tracked, and the immunotoxic potential was evaluated by sequence comparison with peptides known to stimulate celiac immune responses. The results indicate that proteolysis and precipitation of gliadins occurring during brewing differ by protein region and brewing stage. The termini of gliadins were hydrolyzed throughout the entire brewing process, but the central regions remained relatively stable. Most hydrolysis occurred during malting, and most precipitation occurred during boiling. The addition of yeast yielded new cleavage sites but did not result in complete hydrolysis. Consistent detection of peptides within the clinically important regions of gliadin corroborated the hydrolytic resistance of this region. N-terminal labeling mass spectrometry served as a novel approach to track the fate of gliadin/gluten throughout bench-scale brewing. Consistently identified fragments could serve as improved targets for the detection of hydrolyzed gluten in fermented products.
PXD025763	34029587	Arginine methylation of SARS-Cov-2 nucleocapsid protein regulates RNA binding, its ability to suppress stress granule formation, and viral replication. 	Arginine Methylation Regulates SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein Function and Viral Replication	Covid-19, PRMT1, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, RGG/RG motif, RNA binding, SARS-CoV-2, arginine methylation, condensate, nucleocapsid (N) protein, stress granules, type I PRMT inhibitor	Viral proteins are known to be methylated by host protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) necessary for the viral life cycle, but it remains unknown whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins are methylated. Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG motifs, preferred PRMT target sequences. We confirmed arginine methylation of N protein by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated from cell culture. Type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95 or R177 with lysine inhibited interaction of N protein with the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, a property required for viral packaging. We also defined the N protein interactome in HEK293 cells, which identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates, including the known interacting protein G3BP1 as well as other components of stress granules (SGs), which are part of the host antiviral response. Methylation of R95 regulated the ability of N protein to suppress the formation of SGs, as R95K substitution or MS023 treatment blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the coexpression of methylarginine reader Tudor domain-containing protein 3 quenched N protein-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, pretreatment of VeroE6 cells with MS023 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication. Because type I PRMT inhibitors are already undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment, inhibiting arginine methylation to target the later stages of the viral life cycle such as viral genome packaging and assembly of virions may represent an additional therapeutic application of these drugs.
PXD023999	34029588	The antiviral enzyme viperin inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis. 	Viperin inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis and interacts with enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway	cholesterol regulation, interactome analysis, lanosterol synthase, radical SAM enzyme, squalene monooxygenase, viperin	Many enveloped viruses bud from cholesterol-rich lipid rafts on the cell membrane. Depleting cellular cholesterol impedes this process and results in viral particles with reduced viability. Viperin (Virus Inhibitory Protein, Endoplasmic Reticulum-associated, Interferon iNducible) is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-associated enzyme that exerts broad-ranging antiviral effects, including inhibiting the budding of some enveloped viruses. However, the relationship between viperin expression and the retarded budding of virus particles from lipid rafts on the cell membrane is unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of viperin expression on cholesterol biosynthesis using transiently expressed genes in the human cell line human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T). We found that viperin expression reduces cholesterol levels by 20% to 30% in these cells. Following this observation, a proteomic screen of the viperin interactome identified several cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes among the top hits, including lanosterol synthase (LS) and squalene monooxygenase (SM), which are enzymes that catalyze key steps in establishing the sterol carbon skeleton. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that viperin, LS, and SM form a complex at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. While coexpression of viperin was found to significantly inhibit the specific activity of LS in HEK293T cell lysates, coexpression of viperin had no effect on the specific activity of SM, although did reduce SM protein levels by approximately 30%. Despite these inhibitory effects, the coexpression of neither LS nor SM was able to reverse the viperin-induced depletion of cellular cholesterol levels, possibly because viperin is highly expressed in transfected HEK293T cells. Our results establish a link between viperin expression and downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis that helps explain viperin's antiviral effects against enveloped viruses.
PXD020374	34029590	The dipeptide prolyl-hydroxyproline promotes cellular homeostasis and lamellipodia-driven motility via active beta1-integrin in adult tendon cells. 	Collagen-derived prolyl-hydroxyproline dipeptide promotes cellular homeostasis and lamellipodia-driven cell motility through active beta1-integrin in adult tendon cells	Adult tendon cells, Cell motility, Collagen-derived peptide, Extracellular matrix, Extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Proline-hydroxyproline, Scleraxis	Collagen-derived hydroxyproline (Hyp)-containing peptides have a variety of biological effects on cells. These bioactive collagen peptides are locally generated by the degradation of endogenous collagen in response to injury. However, no comprehensive study has yet explored the functional links between Hyp-containing peptides and cellular behavior. Here, we show that the dipeptide prolyl-4-hydroxyproline (Pro-Hyp) exhibits pronounced effects on mouse tendon cells. Pro-Hyp promotes differentiation/maturation of tendon cells with modulation of lineage-specific factors and induces significant chemotactic activity in vitro. In addition, Pro-Hyp has profound effects on cell proliferation, with significantly upregulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and extracellular matrix production and increased type I collagen network organization. Using proteomics, we have predicted molecular transport, cellular assembly and organization, and cellular movement as potential linked-network pathways that could be altered in response to Pro-Hyp. Mechanistically, cells treated with Pro-Hyp demonstrate increased directional persistence and significantly increased directed motility and migration velocity. They are accompanied by elongated lamellipodial protrusions with increased levels of active beta1-integrin-containing focal contacts, as well as reorganization of thicker peripheral F-actin fibrils. Pro-Hyp-mediated chemotactic activity is significantly reduced (p < 0.001) in cells treated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 inhibitor PD98059 or the alpha5beta1-integrin antagonist ATN-161. Furthermore, ATN-161 significantly inhibits uptake of Pro-Hyp into adult tenocytes. Thus, our findings document the molecular basis of the functional benefits of the Pro-Hyp dipeptide in cellular behavior. These dynamic properties of collagen-derived Pro-Hyp dipeptide could lead the way to its application in translational medicine.
PXD024817	34030039	Profile of protein lysine propionylation in Aeromonas hydrophila and its role in enzymatic regulation. 	The profile of protein lysine propionylation in Aeromonas hydrophila	Aeromonas hydrophila, lysine propionylation	Protein lysine propionylation (Kpr) modification is a novel post-translational modification (PTM) of prokaryotic cells that was recently discovered; however, it is not clear how this modification regulates bacterial life. In this study, the protein Kpr modification profile in Aeromonas hydrophila was identified by high specificity antibody-based affinity enrichment combined with high resolution LC MS/MS. A total of 98 lysine-propionylated peptides with 59 Kpr proteins were identified, most of which were associated with energy metabolism, transcription and translation processes. To further understand the role of Kpr modified proteins, the K168 site on malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and K608 site on acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (AcsA) were subjected to site-directed mutation to arginine (R) and glutamine (Q) to simulate deacylation and propionylation, respectively. Subsequent measurement of the enzymatic activity showed that the K168 site of Kpr modification on MDH may negatively regulate the MDH enzymatic activity while also affecting the survival of mdh derivatives when using glucose as the carbon source, whereas Kpr modification of K608 of AcsA does not. Overall, the results of this study indicate that protein Kpr modification plays an important role in bacterial biological functions, especially those involved in the activity of metabolic enzymes.
PXD017040	34031387	Cul3 regulates cytoskeleton protein homeostasis and cell migration during a critical window of brain development. 	Cullin 3 Mouse Brain TMT-based Proteomics Analysis	Mouse Brain Cullin 3 Cul3 Autism Cortex Cerebellum Hippocampus Embryonic Adult TMT DDA high pH RP	De novo loss of function mutations in the ubiquitin ligase-encoding gene Cullin3 (CUL3) lead to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In mouse, constitutive Cul3 haploinsufficiency leads to motor coordination deficits as well as ASD-relevant social and cognitive impairments. However, induction of Cul3 haploinsufficiency later in life does not lead to ASD-relevant behaviors, pointing to an important role of Cul3 during a critical developmental window. Here we show that Cul3 is essential to regulate neuronal migration and, therefore, constitutive Cul3 heterozygous mutant mice display cortical lamination abnormalities. At the molecular level, we found that Cul3 controls neuronal migration by tightly regulating the amount of Plastin3 (Pls3), a previously unrecognized player of neural migration. Furthermore, we found that Pls3 cell-autonomously regulates cell migration by regulating actin cytoskeleton organization, and its levels are inversely proportional to neural migration speed. Finally, we provide evidence that cellular phenotypes associated with autism-linked gene haploinsufficiency can be rescued by transcriptional activation of the intact allele in vitro, offering a proof of concept for a potential therapeutic approach for ASDs.
PXD024432	34031424	Cryo-EM structure of the mature and infective Mayaro virus at 4.4 Aa resolution reveals features of arthritogenic alphaviruses. 	Cryo-EM structure of the mature and infective Mayaro virus at 4.4 Å resolution reveals new features of arthritogenic alphaviruses	Cryo-EM structure, Glycosylation, alphaviruses	Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus of the Americas that may cause a debilitating arthritogenic disease. The biology of MAYV is not fully understood and largely inferred from related arthritogenic alphaviruses. Here, we present the structure of MAYV at 4.4 Aa resolution, obtained from a preparation of mature, infective virions. MAYV presents typical alphavirus features and organization. Interactions between viral proteins that lead to particle formation are described together with a hydrophobic pocket formed between E1 and E2 spike proteins and conformational epitopes specific of MAYV. We also describe MAYV glycosylation residues in E1 and E2 that may affect MXRA8 host receptor binding, and a molecular "handshake" between MAYV spikes formed by N262 glycosylation in adjacent E2 proteins. The structure of MAYV is suggestive of structural and functional complexity among alphaviruses, which may be targeted for specificity or antiviral activity.
PXD022156	34032442	Establishment of a Mass-Spectrometry-Based Method for the Identification of the In Vivo Whole Blood and Plasma ADP-Ribosylomes. 	Development of a mass-spectrometry based method for the identification of the in vivo whole blood and plasma ADP-ribosylomes	ADP-ribosylation, blood, histidine ADP-ribosylation, plasma, sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome	Blood and plasma proteins are heavily investigated as biomarkers for different diseases. However, the post-translational modification states of these proteins are rarely analyzed since blood contains many enzymes that rapidly remove these modifications after sampling. In contrast to the well-described role of protein ADP-ribosylation in cells and organs, its role in blood remains mostly uncharacterized. Here, we discovered that plasma phosphodiesterases and/or ADP-ribosylhydrolases rapidly demodify in vitro ADP-ribosylated proteins. Thus, to identify the in vivo whole blood and plasma ADP-ribosylomes, we established a mass-spectrometry-based workflow that was applied to blood samples collected from LPS-treated pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), which serves as a model for human systemic inflammatory response syndrome. These analyses identified 60 ADP-ribosylated proteins, 17 of which were ADP-ribosylated plasma proteins. This new protocol provides an important step forward for the rapidly developing field of ADP-ribosylation and defines the blood and plasma ADP-ribosylomes under both healthy and disease conditions.
PXD016876	34033897	Proteomics of purified lamellocytes from Drosophila melanogaster HopT(um-l) identifies new membrane proteins and networks involved in their functions. 	Drosophila melanogaster lamellocytes proteome	Biotin-avidin protein purification, Drosophila melanogaster, hemocytes purification, lamellocytes, membrane proteins	In healthy Drosophila melanogaster larvae, plasmatocytes and crystal cells account for 95% and 5% of the hemocytes, respectively. A third type of hemocytes, lamellocytes, are rare, but their number increases after oviposition by parasitoid wasps. The lamellocytes form successive layers around the parasitoid egg, leading to its encapsulation and melanization, and finally the death of this intruder. However, the total number of lamellocytes per larva remains quite low even after parasitoid infestation, making direct biochemical studies difficult. Here, we used the Hop(Tum-l) mutant strain that constitutively produces large numbers of lamellocytes to set up a purification method and analyzed their major proteins by 2D gel electrophoresis and their plasma membrane surface proteins by 1D SDS-PAGE after affinity purification. Mass spectrometry identified 430 proteins from 2D spots and 344 affinity-purified proteins from 1D bands, for a total of 639 unique proteins. Known lamellocyte markers such as PPO3 and the myospheroid integrin were among the components identified with specific chaperone proteins. Affinity purification detected other integrins, as well as a wide range of integrin-associated proteins involved in the formation and function of cell-cell junctions. Overall, the newly identified proteins indicate that these cells are highly adapted to the encapsulation process (recognition, motility, adhesion, signaling), but may also have several other physiological functions (such as secretion and internalization of vesicles) under different signaling pathways. These results provide the basis for further in vivo and in vitro studies of lamellocytes, including the development of new markers to identify coexisting populations and their respective origins and functions in Drosophila immunity.
PXD015277	34033948	Normothermic Ex-vivo Kidney Perfusion in a Porcine Auto-Transplantation Model Preserves the Expression of Key Mitochondrial Proteins: An Unbiased Proteomics Analysis. 	Proteomics analysis of Normothermic Ex-Vivo perfusion in a DCD auto-transplantation model	DCD, Ischemia-reperfusion injury, Kidney, NEVKP, Perfusion, Transplant	Normothermic ex-vivo kidney perfusion (NEVKP) results in significantly improved graft function in porcine auto-transplant models of donation after circulatory death injury compared with static cold storage (SCS); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects remain unclear. We performed an unbiased proteomics analysis of 28 kidney biopsies obtained at three time points from pig kidneys subjected to 30 min of warm ischemia, followed by 8 h of NEVKP or SCS, and auto-transplantation. 70/6593 proteins quantified were differentially expressed between NEVKP and SCS groups (false discovery rate < 0.05). Proteins increased in NEVKP mediated key metabolic processes including fatty acid beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Comparison of our findings with external datasets of ischemia-reperfusion and other models of kidney injury confirmed that 47 of our proteins represent a common signature of kidney injury reversed or attenuated by NEVKP. We validated key metabolic proteins (electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta and carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2, mitochondrial) by immunoblotting. Transcription factor databases identified members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) family of transcription factors as the upstream regulators of our dataset, and we confirmed increased expression of PPARA, PPARD, and RXRA in NEVKP with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The proteome-level changes observed in NEVKP mediate critical metabolic pathways. These effects may be coordinated by PPAR-family transcription factors and may represent novel therapeutic targets in ischemia-reperfusion injury.
PXD024493	34035302	Activation of Prp28 ATPase by phosphorylated Npl3 at a critical step of spliceosome remodeling. 	LC-MS/MS analysis of Prp28-E326BPA experiment	Prp28	Splicing, a key step in the eukaryotic gene-expression pathway, converts precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) into mRNA by excising introns and ligating exons. This task is accomplished by the spliceosome, a macromolecular machine that must undergo sequential conformational changes to establish its active site. Each of these major changes requires a dedicated DExD/H-box ATPase, but how these enzymes are activated remain obscure. Here we show that Prp28, a yeast DEAD-box ATPase, transiently interacts with the conserved 5' splice-site (5'SS) GU dinucleotide and makes splicing-dependent contacts with the U1 snRNP protein U1C, and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP proteins, Prp8, Brr2, and Snu114. We further show that Prp28's ATPase activity is potentiated by the phosphorylated Npl3, but not the unphosphorylated Npl3, thus suggesting a strategy for regulating DExD/H-box ATPases. We propose that Npl3 is a functional counterpart of the metazoan-specific Prp28 N-terminal region, which can be phosphorylated and serves as an anchor to human spliceosome.
PXD027985	34035340	A comparative study of synthetic winged peptides for absolute protein quantification. 	A comparative study of synthetic winged peptides for absolute protein quantification	SIL-peptides, SIL-proteins, absolute protein quantification, internal standards, synthetic winged peptides, targeted proteomics assays	A proper internal standard choice is critical for accurate, precise, and reproducible mass spectrometry-based proteomics assays. Synthetic isotopically labeled (SIL) proteins are currently considered the gold standard. However, they are costly and challenging to obtain. An alternative approach uses SIL peptides or SIL "winged" peptides extended at C- or/and N-terminus with an amino acid sequence or a tag cleaved during enzymatic proteolysis. However, a consensus on the design of a winged peptide for absolute quantification is missing. In this study, we used human serum albumin as a model system to compare the quantitative performance of reference SIL protein with four different designs of SIL winged peptides: (i) commercially available SIL peptides with a proprietary trypsin cleavable tag at C-terminus, (ii) SIL peptides extended with five amino acid residues at C-terminus, (iii) SIL peptides extended with three and (iv) with five amino acid residues at both C- and N-termini. Our results demonstrate properties of various SIL extended peptides designs, e.g., water solubility and efficiency of trypsin enzymatic cleavage with primary influence on quantitative performance. SIL winged peptides extended with three amino acids at both C- and N-termini demonstrated optimal quantitative performance, equivalent to the SIL protein.
PXD021963	34035355	A predictive model for vertebrate bone identification from collagen using proteomic mass spectrometry. 	species identification using bone protein	LC-MS/MS MALDI, bone	Proteogenomics is an increasingly common method for species identification as it allows for rapid and inexpensive interrogation of an unknown organism's proteome-even when the proteome is partially degraded. The proteomic method typically uses tandem mass spectrometry to survey all peptides detectable in a sample that frequently contains hundreds or thousands of proteins. Species identification is based on detection of a small numbers of species-specific peptides. Genetic analysis of proteins by mass spectrometry, however, is a developing field, and the bone proteome, typically consisting of only two proteins, pushes the limits of this technology. Nearly 20% of highly confident spectra from modern human bone samples identify non-human species when searched against a vertebrate database-as would be necessary with a fragment of unknown bone. These non-human peptides are often the result of current limitations in mass spectrometry or algorithm interpretation errors. Consequently, it is difficult to know if a "species-specific" peptide used to identify a sample is actually present in that sample. Here we evaluate the causes of peptide sequence errors and propose an unbiased, probabilistic approach to determine the likelihood that a species is correctly identified from bone without relying on species-specific peptides.
PXD024792	34038017	Regulation of aquaporin-4 expression in the central nervous system investigated using M23-AQP4 null mouse. 	Aquaporin-4 mRNA binding proteins	Mouse Spinal cord, RNA-protein pulldown	In astrocytes, unknown mechanisms regulate the expression of M1 and M23 isoforms of water channel aquaporin-4 (M1-AQP4 and M23-AQP4). The ratio between these two isoforms controls the AQP4 assembly state in the plasma membrane known as orthogonal arrays of particles (OAPs). To give new insights into these mechanisms, here, we explore the regulation of AQP4 expression in the spinal cord of a CRISPR/Cas9 M23-null mouse model (M23-null). In the M23-null spinal cord OAP assembly, the perivascular localization of AQP4 and M1-AQP4 protein were drastically reduced. In heterozygous, M1-AQP4 was proportionally reduced with M23-AQP4, maintaining the isoform ratio unaffected. We hypothesize a role of the M23-AQP4 in the regulation of M1-AQP4 expression. M1-AQP4 transcription, splicing and M1-AQP4 protein degradation were found to be unaffected in M23-null spinal cord and in M23-null astrocyte primary culture. The translational control was investigated by mRNA-protein pull down and quantitative mass spectrometry, to isolate and quantify AQP4 mRNA binding proteins (AQP4-RBPs). Compared to WT, in M23-null spinal cord, the interaction between AQP4 mRNA and polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1, a positive regulator of AQP4 translation, was higher, while interaction with the RNA helicase DDX17 was lower. In astrocyte primary cultures, DDX17 knockdown upregulated AQP4 protein expression and increased cell swelling, leaving AQP4 mRNA levels unchanged. Here, we identify AQP4-RBPs and provide evidence that in mouse spinal cord M23-AQP4 deletion changes the interaction between AQP4 mRNA and some RBPs involved in AQP4 translation. We describe for the first time the RNA helicase DDX17 as a regulator of AQP4 expression in astrocytes.
PXD022169	34038140	Comparative Evaluation of MaxQuant and Proteome Discoverer MS1-Based Protein Quantification Tools. 	Comparative Evaluation of MaxQuant and Proteome Discoverer MS1-based Protein Quantification Tools	accuracy, differential analysis, dynamic range, label-free quantification, precision, sensitivity, specificity	MS1-based label-free quantification can compare precursor ion peaks across runs, allowing reproducible protein measurements. Among bioinformatic platforms enabling MS1-based quantification, MaxQuant (MQ) is one of the most used, while Proteome Discoverer (PD) has recently introduced the Minora tool. Here, we present a comparative evaluation of six MS1-based quantification methods available in MQ and PD. Intensity (MQ and PD) and area (PD only) of the precursor ion peaks were measured and then subjected or not to normalization. The six methods were applied to data sets simulating various differential proteomics scenarios and covering a wide range of protein abundance ratios and amounts. PD outperformed MQ in terms of quantification yield, dynamic range, and reproducibility, although neither platform reached a fully satisfactory quality of measurements at low-abundance ranges. PD methods including normalization were the most accurate in estimating the abundance ratio between groups and the most sensitive when comparing groups with a narrow abundance ratio; on the contrary, MQ methods generally reached slightly higher specificity, accuracy, and precision values. Moreover, we found that applying an optimized log ratio-based threshold can maximize specificity, accuracy, and precision. Taken together, these results can help researchers choose the most appropriate MS1-based protein quantification strategy for their studies.
PXD023243	34039272	A workflow to identify novel proteins based on the direct mapping of peptide-spectrum-matches to genomic locations. 	Direct mapping of peptide-spectral-matches to genome information facilitates qualifying proteomics information	SIHUMI, intestine, metaomics	BACKGROUND: Small Proteins have received increasing attention in recent years. They have in particular been implicated as signals contributing to the coordination of bacterial communities. In genome annotations they are often missing or hidden among large numbers of hypothetical proteins because genome annotation pipelines often exclude short open reading frames or over-predict hypothetical proteins based on simple models. The validation of novel proteins, and in particular of small proteins (sProteins), therefore requires additional evidence. Proteogenomics is considered the gold standard for this purpose. It extends beyond established annotations and includes all possible open reading frames (ORFs) as potential sources of peptides, thus allowing the discovery of novel, unannotated proteins. Typically this results in large numbers of putative novel small proteins fraught with large fractions of false-positive predictions. RESULTS: We observe that number and quality of the peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) that map to a candidate ORF can be highly informative for the purpose of distinguishing proteins from spurious ORF annotations. We report here on a workflow that aggregates PSM quality information and local context into simple descriptors and reliably separates likely proteins from the large pool of false-positive, i.e., most likely untranslated ORFs. We investigated the artificial gut microbiome model SIHUMIx, comprising eight different species, for which we validate 5114 proteins that have previously been annotated only as hypothetical ORFs. In addition, we identified 37 non-annotated protein candidates for which we found evidence at the proteomic and transcriptomic level. Half (19) of these candidates have close functional homologs in other species. Another 12 candidates have homologs designated as hypothetical proteins in other species. The remaining six candidates are short (< 100 AA) and are most likely bona fide novel proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The aggregation of PSM quality information for predicted ORFs provides a robust and efficient method to identify novel proteins in proteomics data. The workflow is in particular capable of identifying small proteins and frameshift variants. Since PSMs are explicitly mapped to genomic locations, it furthermore facilitates the integration of transcriptomics data and other sources of genome-level information.
PXD016810	34039408	Proteomics analysis reveals that the proto-oncogene eIF-5A indirectly influences the growth, invasion and replication of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoite. 	Toxoplasma gondii eIF-5A knockdown iTraq	Toxoplasma gondii, iTraq	BACKGROUND: The proliferative stage (tachyzoite) of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is critical for its transmission and pathogenesis, and a proto-oncogene eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF-5A) plays an important role in various cellular processes such as cell multiplication. METHODS: We performed a proteomic study to evaluate the specific roles of eIF-5A involved in invasion and replication of T. gondii, and both in vivo and in vitro trials using eIF-5A-interfered and wild tachyzoites were performed to verify the proteomic results. RESULTS: The results of our study showed that T. gondii eIF-5A affected tachyzoite growth and also participated in the synthesis of proteins through regulation of both ribosomal and splicing pathways. Inhibition of eIF-5A in T. gondii resulted in the downregulated expression of soluble adhesions, such as microneme protein 1 (MIC1) and MIC4, which in turn decreased the parasite population that adhered to the surface of host cells. The reduced attachment, combined with lower expression of some rhoptry proteins (ROPs) and dense granule antigens (GRAs) involved in different stages of T. gondii invasion such as ROP4 and GRA3, ultimately reduce the invasion efficiency. These processes regulated by eIF-5A eventually affect the replication of tachyzoites. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that eIF-5A influenced tachyzoite survival and was also involved in the process of parasite invasion and replication. These results will provide new clues for further development of targeted drugs to control T. gondii infection.
PXD014084	34039990	The splicing factor XAB2 interacts with ERCC1-XPF and XPG for R-loop processing. 	XAB2 involved in RNA processing.	RNA processing, XAB2, in vivo biotinylation, interaction analysis, nucleotide excision repair, pre-mRNAs, snRNAs	RNA splicing, transcription and the DNA damage response are intriguingly linked in mammals but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an in vivo biotinylation tagging approach in mice, we show that the splicing factor XAB2 interacts with the core spliceosome and that it binds to spliceosomal U4 and U6 snRNAs and pre-mRNAs in developing livers. XAB2 depletion leads to aberrant intron retention, R-loop formation and DNA damage in cells. Studies in illudin S-treated cells and Csb(m/m) developing livers reveal that transcription-blocking DNA lesions trigger the release of XAB2 from all RNA targets tested. Immunoprecipitation studies reveal that XAB2 interacts with ERCC1-XPF and XPG endonucleases outside nucleotide excision repair and that the trimeric protein complex binds RNA:DNA hybrids under conditions that favor the formation of R-loops. Thus, XAB2 functionally links the spliceosomal response to DNA damage with R-loop processing with important ramifications for transcription-coupled DNA repair disorders.
PXD020763	34041269	Quantitative Proteomics Analysis of FFPE Tumor Samples Reveals the Influences of NET-1 siRNA Nanoparticles and Sonodynamic Therapy on Tetraspanin Protein Involved in HCC. 	FFPE tumor samples reveals the influences of NET-1 siRNA nanoparticles and sonodynamic therapy on tetraspanin protein involved in HCC	hepatocellular carcinoma, sonodynamic therapy, tetraspanin protein, ultrasound	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a severe threat to human health. The NET-1 protein has been proved to be strongly associated with HCC proliferation and metastasis in our previous study. Here, we established and validated the NET-1 siRNA nanoparticles system to conduct targeted gene therapy of HCC xenograft in vivo with the aid of sonodynamic therapy. Then, we conducted a label-free proteome mass spectrometry workflow to analyze formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded HCC xenograft samples collected in this study. The result showed that 78 proteins were differentially expressed after NET-1 protein inhibited. Among them, the expression of 17 proteins upregulated and the expression of 61 proteins were significantly downregulated. Of the protein abundance, the vast majority of Gene Ontology enrichment terms belong to the biological process. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the 78 differentially expressed proteins significantly enriched in 45 pathways. We concluded that the function of the NET-1 gene is not only to regulate HCC but also to participate in a variety of biochemical metabolic pathways in the human body. Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that the interactions of differentially expressed proteins are incredibly sophisticated. All the protein-protein interactions happened after the NET-1 gene has been silenced. Finally, our study also provides a useful proposal for targeted therapy based on tetraspanin proteins to treat HCC, and further mechanism investigations are needed to reveal a more detailed mechanism of action for NET-1 protein regulation of HCC.
PXD024298	34043369	A Compendium of Murine (Phospho)Peptides Encompassing Different Isobaric Labeling and Data Acquisition Strategies. 	A compendium of murine (phospho)peptides encompassing different isobaric labeling and data acquisition strategies	3T3, FAIMS, TMT, TMTpro, eclipse, targeted proteomics	Targeted mass spectrometry-based assays typically rely on previously acquired large data sets for peptide target selection. Such repositories are widely available for unlabeled peptides. However, they are less common for isobaric tagged peptides. Here we have assembled two series of six data sets originating from a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (NIH/3T3). One series is of peptides derived from a tryptic digest of a whole cell proteome and a second from enriched phosphopeptides. These data sets encompass three labeling approaches (unlabeled, TMT11-labeled, and TMTpro16-labeled) and two data acquisition strategies (ion trap MS2 with and without FAIMS-based gas phase separation). We identified a total of 1 509 526 peptide-spectrum matches which covered 11 482 proteins from the whole cell proteome tryptic digest, and 188 849 phosphopeptides from the phosphopeptide enrichment. The data sets were of similar depth, and while overlap across data sets was modest, protein overlap was high, thus reinforcing the comprehensiveness of these data sets. The data also supported FAIMS as a means to increase data set depth. These data sets provide a rich resource of peptides that may be used as starting points for targeted assays. Future data sets may be compiled for any genome-sequenced organism using the technologies and strategies highlighted herein. The data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium with data set identifier PXD024298.
PXD023117	34044167	Proteomics analysis reveals the importance of transcriptional regulator slyA in regulation of several physiological functions in Aeromonas hydrophila. 	Proteomics analysis reveals the importance of transcriptional regulator slyA in regulation of diverse physiological functions in Aeromonas hydrophila	Aeromonas hydrophila, outer membrane permeability, slyA, sulfur metabolism	SlyA is a well-known transcription factor that plays important roles in the regulation of diverse physiological functions including virulence and stress response in various bacterial species. The biological effects of slyA have species-specific characteristics. In this study, a phenotype assay showed that slyA gene deletion in Aeromonas hydrophila (ahslyA) decreased biofilm formation capability but did not affect bacterial hemolytic activity or acid stress response. The differentially expressed proteins between DeltaahslyA and wild-type strains were compared by label-free quantitative proteomics to further understand the effects of AhSlyA on biological functions. Bioinformatics assays showed that DeltaahslyA may be involved in the regulation of several intracellular metabolic pathways such as galactose metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and sulfur metabolism. A further phenotypic assay confirmed that AhSlyA plays an important role in the regulation of sulfur and phosphate metabolism. Moreover, ahslyA also directly or indirectly regulated at least eight outer membrane proteins involved in the maintenance of cell permeability. Overall, the results provide insights into the functions of ahslyA and demonstrate its importance in A. hydrophila. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we compared the DEPs between the transcriptional regulator slyA-deleted and the wild-type A. hydrophila strains using a label-free quantitative proteomics method. The bioinformatics analysis showed that slyA may be involved in the regulation of several metabolic pathways. Subsequent phenotype and growth assays confirmed that DeltaahslyA affected sulfur and phosphate metabolism, and OM permeability. Finally, a ChIP-PCR assay further confirmed that AhSlyA directly binds to the promoters of several candidate genes, including sulfur metabolism-related genes. These results indicated that slyA plays an important regulatory role in pleiotropic physiological functions of A. hydrophila, and these functions may be different from those identified in previous reports from other bacterial species.
PXD023975	34044169	Proteome remodeling in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis PknG knockout: Molecular evidence for the role of this kinase in cell envelope biogenesis and hypoxia response. 	Proteome remodeling in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis PknG knockout: molecular hints for the role of this kinase in cell envelope biogenesis and hypoxia.	Hrp-1, Mas, Msl3, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, PknG, Serine/Threonine protein kinase, hypoxia, parallel reaction monitoring, shotgun proteomics	Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of tuberculosis, is among the deadliest human pathogens. One of M. tuberculosis's pathogenic hallmarks is its ability to persist in a dormant state in the host. Thus, this pathogen has developed mechanisms to withstand stressful conditions found in the human host. Particularly, the Ser/Thr-protein kinase PknG has gained relevance since it regulates nitrogen metabolism and facilitates bacterial survival inside macrophages. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are far from being elucidated. To further investigate these issues, we performed quantitative proteomic analyses of protein extracts from M. tuberculosis H37Rv and a mutant lacking pknG. We found that in the absence of PknG the mycobacterial proteome was remodeled since 5.7% of the proteins encoded by M. tuberculosis presented significant changes in its relative abundance compared with the wild-type. The main biological processes affected by pknG deletion were cell envelope components biosynthesis and response to hypoxia. Thirteen DosR-regulated proteins were underrepresented in the pknG deletion mutant, including Hrp-1, which was 12.5-fold decreased according to Parallel Reaction Monitoring experiments. Altogether, our results allow us to postulate that PknG regulation of bacterial adaptation to stress conditions might be an important mechanism underlying its reported effect on intracellular bacterial survival. SIGNIFICANCE: PknG is a Ser/Thr kinase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis with key roles in bacterial metabolism and bacterial survival within the host. However, at present the molecular mechanisms underlying these functions remain largely unknown. In this work, we evaluate the effect of pknG deletion on M. tuberculosis proteome using different approaches. Our results clearly show that the global proteome was remodeled in the absence of PknG and shed light on new molecular mechanism underlying PknG role. Altogether, this work contributes to a better understanding of the molecular bases of the adaptation of M. tuberculosis, one of the most deadly human pathogens, to its host.
PXD024011	34046053	Comparative Analysis of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus Secretome Under Pinus pinaster and P. pinea Stimuli. 	Bursaphelenchus xylophilus secretome under Pinus pinaster and P. pinea stimuli	Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, P. pinea, Pinus pinaster, SWATH-MS, secretome	The pinewood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the pine wilt disease's (PWD) causal agent, is a migratory endoparasitic nematode skilled to feed on pine tissues and on fungi that colonize the trees. In order to study B. xylophilus secretomes under the stimulus of pine species with different susceptibilities to disease, nematodes were exposed to aqueous pine extracts from Pinus pinaster (high-susceptible host) and P. pinea (low-susceptible host). Sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) was used to determine relative changes in protein amounts between B. xylophilus secretions, and a total of 776 secreted proteins were quantified in both secretomes. From these, 22 proteins were found increased in the B. xylophilus secretome under the P. pinaster stimulus and 501 proteins increased under the P. pinea stimulus. Functional analyses of the 22 proteins found increased in the P. pinaster stimulus showed that proteins with peptidase, hydrolase, and antioxidant activities were the most represented. On the other hand, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the 501 proteins increased under the P. pinea stimulus revealed an enrichment of proteins with binding activity. The differences detected in the secretomes highlighted the diverse responses from the nematode to overcome host defenses with different susceptibilities and provide new clues on the mechanism behind the pathogenicity of this plant-parasitic nematode. Proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD024011.
PXD024726	34046180	Environmentally relevant concentrations of titanium dioxide nanoparticles pose negligible risk to marine microbes. 	Shotgun proteomic analysis of the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus sp. MED4 exposed to titanium dioxide nanoparticles	Cyanobacteria, Ecotoxicology, Marine, Nanomaterials, Phytoplankton	Nano-sized titanium dioxide (nTiO2) represents the highest produced nanomaterial by mass worldwide and, due to its prevalent industrial and commercial use, it inevitably reaches the natural environment. Previous work has revealed a negative impact of nTiO2 upon marine phytoplankton growth, however, studies are typically carried out at concentrations far exceeding those measured and predicted to occur in the environment currently. Here, a series of experiments were carried out to assess the effects of both research-grade nTiO2 and nTiO2 extracted from consumer products upon the marine dominant cyanobacterium, Prochlorococcus, and natural marine communities at environmentally relevant and supra-environmental concentrations (i.e., 1 mug L(-1) to 100 mg L(-1)). Cell declines observed in Prochlorococcus cultures were associated with the extensive aggregation behaviour of nTiO2 in saline media and the subsequent entrapment of microbial cells. Hence, higher concentrations of nTiO2 particles exerted a stronger decline of cyanobacterial populations. However, within natural oligotrophic seawater, cultures were able to recover over time as the nanoparticles aggregated out of solution after 72 h. Subsequent shotgun proteomic analysis of Prochlorococcus cultures exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations confirmed minimal molecular features of toxicity, suggesting that direct physical effects are responsible for short-term microbial population decline. In an additional experiment, the diversity and structure of natural marine microbial communities showed negligible variations when exposed to environmentally relevant nTiO2 concentrations (i.e., 25 mug L(-1)). As such, the environmental risk of nTiO2 towards marine microbial species appears low, however the potential for adverse effects in hotspots of contamination exists. In future, research must be extended to consider any effect of other components of nano-enabled product formulations upon nanomaterial fate and impact within the natural environment.
PXD015879	34046254	High glucose treatment promotes extracellular matrix proteome remodeling in Mller glial cells. 	High glucose treatment promotes extracellular matrix proteome remodeling in Müller glial cells	Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Müller cells (RMG), extracellular matrix (ECM), hyperglycemia, inner limiting membrane (ILM), neurodegeneration, secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1)	BACKGROUND: The underlying pathomechanisms in diabetic retinopathy (DR) remain incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to add to the current knowledge about the particular role of retinal Mller glial cells (RMG) in the initial processes of DR. METHODS: Applying a quantitative proteomic workflow, we investigated changes of primary porcine RMG under short term high glucose treatment as well as glycolysis inhibition treatment. RESULTS: We revealed significant changes in RMG proteome primarily in proteins building the extracellular matrix (ECM) indicating fundamental remodeling processes of ECM as novel rapid response to high glucose treatment. Among others, Osteopontin (SPP1) as well as its interacting integrins were significantly downregulated and organotypic retinal explant culture confirmed the selective loss of SPP1 in RMG upon treatment. Since SPP1 in the retina has been described neuroprotective for photoreceptors and functions against experimentally induced cell swelling, its rapid loss under diabetic conditions may point to a direct involvement of RMG to the early neurodegenerative processes driving DR. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD015879.
PXD021593	34048472	A proteomic-informed view of the changes induced by loss of cellular adherence: The example of mouse macrophages. 	A proteomic-informed view of the changes induced by loss of cellular adherence: the example of mouse macrophages	cellular adherence, macrophage	Except cells circulating in the bloodstream, most cells in vertebrates are adherent. Studying the repercussions of adherence per se in cell physiology is thus very difficult to carry out, although it plays an important role in cancer biology, e.g. in the metastasis process. In order to study how adherence impacts major cell functions, we used a murine macrophage cell line. Opposite to the monocyte/macrophage system, where adherence is associated with the acquisition of differentiated functions, these cells can be grown in both adherent or suspension conditions without altering their differentiated functions (phagocytosis and inflammation signaling). We used a proteomic approach to cover a large panel of proteins potentially modified by the adherence status. Targeted experiments were carried out to validate the proteomic results, e.g. on metabolic enzymes, mitochondrial and cytoskeletal proteins. The mitochondrial activity was increased in non-adherent cells compared with adherent cells, without differences in glucose consumption. Concerning the cytoskeleton, a rearrangement of the actin organization (filopodia vs sub-cortical network) and of the microtubule network were observed between adherent and non-adherent cells. Taken together, these data show the mechanisms at play for the modification of the cytoskeleton and also modifications of the metabolic activity between adherent and non-adherent cells.
PXD024661	34048672	A PROTAC targets splicing factor 3B1. 	A PROTAC Targets Splicing Factor 3B1	HeLa, Orbitrap LUMOS, PROTAC, TMTpro	The proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a new technology to degrade target proteins. However, their clinical application is limited currently by lack of chemical binders to target proteins. For instance, it is still unknown whether splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) is targetable by PROTACs. We recently identified a 2-aminothiazole derivative (herein O4I2) as a promoter in the generation of human pluripotent stem cells. In this work, proteomic analysis on the biotinylated O4I2 revealed that O4I2 targeted SF3B1 and positively regulated RNA splicing. Fusing thalidomide-the ligand of the cereblon ubiquitin ligase-to O4I2 led to a new PROTAC-O4I2, which selectively degraded SF3B1 and induced cellular apoptosis in a CRBN-dependent manner. In a Drosophila intestinal tumor model, PROTAC-O4I2 increased survival by interference with the maintenance and proliferation of stem cell. Thus, our finding demonstrates that SF3B1 is PROTACable by utilizing noninhibitory chemicals, which expands the list of PROTAC target proteins.
PXD022227	34049963	Identification of an Altered Matrix Signature in Kidney Aging and Disease. 	Col4a5 mouse glomerular extracellular matrix	Extracellular Matrix, basement mmebrane, glomerulus, matrix signature	BACKGROUND: Accumulation of extracellular matrix in organs and tissues is a feature of both aging and disease. In the kidney, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis accompany the decline in function, which current therapies cannot address, leading to organ failure. Although histologic and ultrastructural patterns of excess matrix form the basis of human disease classifications, a comprehensive molecular resolution of abnormal matrix is lacking. METHODS: Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we resolved matrix composition over age in mouse models of kidney disease. We compared the changes in mice with a global characterization of human kidneymatrix during aging and to existing kidney disease datasets to identify common molecular features. RESULTS: Ultrastructural changes in basement membranes are associated with altered cell adhesion and metabolic processes and with distinct matrix proteomes during aging and kidney disease progression in mice. Within the altered matrix, basement membrane components (laminins, type IV collagen, type XVIII collagen) were reduced and interstitial matrix proteins (collagens I, III, VI, and XV; fibrinogens; and nephronectin) were increased, a pattern also seen in human kidney aging. Indeed, this signature of matrix proteins was consistently modulated across all age and disease comparisons, and the increase in interstitial matrix was also observed in human kidney disease datasets. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides deep molecular resolution of matrix accumulation in kidney aging and disease, and identifies a common signature of proteins that provides insight into mechanisms of response to kidney injury and repair.
PXD025486	34050164	Automated annotation and visualisation of high-resolution spatial proteomic mass spectrometry imaging data using HIT-MAP. 	Mouse brain MALDI-imaging proteomics profiling	MALDI-imaging, Mouse brain, bovin lens	Spatial proteomics has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of biology, physiology and medicine. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a powerful tool in the spatial proteomics field, enabling direct detection and registration of protein abundance and distribution across tissues. MALDI-MSI preserves spatial distribution and histology allowing unbiased analysis of complex, heterogeneous tissues. However, MALDI-MSI faces the challenge of simultaneous peptide quantification and identification. To overcome this, we develop and validate HIT-MAP (High-resolution Informatics Toolbox in MALDI-MSI Proteomics), an open-source bioinformatics workflow using peptide mass fingerprint analysis and a dual scoring system to computationally assign peptide and protein annotations to high mass resolution MSI datasets and generate customisable spatial distribution maps. HIT-MAP will be a valuable resource for the spatial proteomics community for analysing newly generated and retrospective datasets, enabling robust peptide and protein annotation and visualisation in a wide array of normal and disease contexts.
PXD025866	34050602	Systematic analysis of the ubiquitome in mouse testis. 	Systematic analysis of the ubiquitome in mouse testis	Ubiquitination, testis	A growing body of evidence now supports the fact that protein ubiquitination is an important modification during the regulation of spermatogenesis. However, little is known about the ubiquitome of the testis. In this study, we created a large-scale mouse testis ubiquitome profile using di-glycine remnant antibodies and mass spectrometry and identified a total of 14,219 ubiquitination sites in 4217 proteins. Bioinformatics and phenotypic analyses showed that the ubiquitinated proteins were closely related to meiosis and spermiogenesis. And 512 ubiquitination regulatory enzymes were identified in testis that can exert regulatory functions over ubiquitination: the homologous to E6AP C-terminus (HECT) and multi-subunit RING-finger type E3 ligases were significantly enriched. In addition, we identified 22 new ubiquitination sites on testicular histones and 146 ubiquitinated epigenetic factors, thus demonstrating that ubiquitination plays an important role in epigenetic regulation. Collectively, this in-depth characterization of the ubiquitome in mouse testis could provide a rich resource for further studies of regulatory events at the protein level during spermatogenesis. All MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD025866.
PXD025073	34052394	Quantitative Consequences of Protein Carriers in Immunopeptidomics and Tyrosine Phosphorylation MS(2) Analyses. 	Quantitative consequences of protein carriers in immunopeptidomics and tyrosine phosphorylation MS2 analyses	MHC, phosphorylation	Utilizing a protein carrier in combination with isobaric labeling to "boost" the signal of other low-level samples in multiplexed analyses has emerged as an attractive strategy to enhance data quantity while minimizing protein input in mass spectrometry analyses. Recent applications of this approach include pMHC profiling and tyrosine phosphoproteomics, two applications that are often limited by large sample requirements. While including a protein carrier has been shown to increase the number of identifiable peptides in both applications, the impact of a protein carrier on quantitative accuracy remains to be thoroughly explored, particularly in relevant biological contexts where samples exhibit dynamic changes in abundance across peptides. Here, we describe two sets of analyses comparing MS(2)-based quantitation using a 20x protein carrier in pMHC analyses and a high (~100x) and low (~9x) protein carrier in pTyr analyses, using CDK4/6 inhibitors and EGF stimulation to drive dynamic changes in the immunopeptidome and phosphoproteome, respectively. In both applications, inclusion of a protein carrier resulted in an increased number of MHC peptide or phosphopeptide identifications, as expected. At the same time, quantitative accuracy was adversely affected by the presence of the protein carrier, altering interpretation of the underlying biological response to perturbation. Moreover, for tyrosine phosphoproteomics, the presence of high levels of protein carrier led to a large number of missing values for endogenous phosphopeptides, leading to fewer quantifiable peptides relative to the "no-boost" condition. These data highlight the unique limitations and future experimental considerations for both analysis types and provide a framework for assessing quantitative accuracy in protein carrier experiments moving forward.
PXD022606	34053216	The Isotopic Ac-IP Tag Enables Multiplexed Proteome Quantification in Data-Independent Acquisition Mode. 	Ac-IP tag enables multiplexed proteome quantification in data-independent acquisition mode	Quantitative proteomics, data-independent acquisition, isotope labeling	Data-independent acquisition (DIA) is an increasingly used approach for quantitative proteomics. However, most current isotope labeling strategies are not suitable for DIA as they lead to more complex MS2 spectra or severe ratio distortion. As a result, DIA suffers from a lower throughput than data-dependent acquisition (DDA) due to a lower level of multiplexing. Herein, we synthesized an isotopically labeled acetyl-isoleucine-proline (Ac-IP) tag for multiplexed quantification in DIA. Differentially labeled peptides have distinct precursor ions carrying the quantitative information but identical MS2 spectra since the isotopically labeled Ac-Ile part leaves as a neutral loss upon collision-induced dissociation, while fragmentation of the peptide backbone generates regular fragment ions for identification. The Ac-IP-labeled samples can be analyzed using general DIA liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry settings, and the data obtained can be processed with established approaches. Relative quantification requires deconvolution of the isotope envelope of the respective precursor ions. Suitability of the Ac-IP tag is demonstrated with a triplex-labeled yeast proteome spiked with bovine serum albumin that was mixed at 10:5:1 ratios, resulting in measured ratios of 9.7:5.3:1.1.
PXD024238	34055594	Multiple Reaction Monitoring-Based Targeted Assays for the Validation of Protein Biomarkers in Brain Tumors. 	MRM for validation of Brain tumor biomarkers	Multiple reaction monitoring, biomarkers, brain tumor, cerebrospinal fluid, tumor tissue	The emergence of omics technologies over the last decade has helped in advancement of research and our understanding of complex diseases like brain cancers. However, barring genomics, no other omics technology has been able to find utility in clinical settings. The recent advancements in mass spectrometry instrumentation have resulted in proteomics technologies becoming more sensitive and reliable. Targeted proteomics, a relatively new branch of mass spectrometry-based proteomics has shown immense potential in addressing the shortcomings of the standard molecular biology-based techniques like Western blotting and Immunohistochemistry. In this study we demonstrate the utility of Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), a targeted proteomics approach, in quantifying peptides from proteins like Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), Apolipoprotein E (APOE), Prostaglandin H2 D-Isomerase (PTGDS), Vitronectin (VTN) and Complement C3 (C3) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from Glioma and Meningioma patients. Additionally, we also report transitions for peptides from proteins - Vimentin (VIM), Cystatin-C (CST3) and Clusterin (CLU) in surgically resected Meningioma tissues; Annexin A1 (ANXA1), Superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and VIM in surgically resected Glioma tissues; and Microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2), Splicing factor 3B subunit 2 (SF3B2) and VIM in surgically resected Medulloblastoma tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the use of MRM to validate proteins from three types of brain malignancies and two different bio-specimens. Future studies involving a large cohort of samples aimed at accurately detecting and quantifying peptides of proteins with roles in brain malignancies could potentially result in a panel of proteins showing ability to classify and grade tumors. Successful application of these techniques could ultimately offer alternative strategies with increased accuracy, sensitivity and lower turnaround time making them translatable to the clinics.
PXD024948	34055809	Acer Truncatum Seed Oil Alleviates Learning and Memory Impairments of Aging Mice. 	Acer truncatum seed oil alleviates learning and memory impairments of aging mice	BDNF, acer truncatum seed oil, aging, learning memory	Aging, characterized by a time-dependent functional decline of physiological integrity, is the major independent risk factor for many neurodegeneration diseases. Therefore, it's necessary to look for natural food supplements to extend the healthy lifespan of aging people. We here treated normal aging mice with acer truncatum seed oil, and found that the seed oil significantly improved the learning and memory ability. Proteomics revealed that the seed oil administration changed many proteins expression involving in biological processes, including complement and coagulation cascades, inflammatory response pathway and innate immune response. BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway was also activated by acer truncatum seed oil treatment. And the seed oil administration increased the expression of postsynaptic related proteins including PSD95, GluA1, and NMDAR1, and decreased the mRNA level of inflammatory factors containing IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. These findings suggest that acer truncatum seed oil holds a promise as a therapeutic food supplement for delaying aging with multiple mechanisms.
PXD023891	34055835	Protein Extraction From FFPE Kidney Tissue Samples: A Review of the Literature and Characterization of Techniques. 	Protein extraction method improvement for FFPE kidney tissue samples	Deparaffinization, Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, LC-MALDI-MS, methylene bridges, proteins extraction, proteomic approaches	Most tissue biopsies from patients in hospital environments are formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) for long-term storage. This fixation process produces a modification in the proteins called "crosslinks", which improves protein stability necessary for their conservation. Currently, these samples are mainly used in clinical practice for performing immunohistochemical analysis, since these modifications do not suppose a drawback for this technique; however, crosslinks difficult the protein extraction process. Accordingly, these modifications make the development of a good protein extraction protocol necessary. Due to the specific characteristics of each tissue, the same extraction buffers or deparaffinization protocols are not equally effective in all cases. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain a specific protocol for each tissue. The present work aims to establish a deparaffinization and protein extraction protocol from FFPE kidney samples to obtain protein enough of high quality for the subsequent proteomic analysis. Different deparaffination, protocols and protein extraction buffers will be tested in FFPE kidney samples. The optimized conditions will be applied in the identification by LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins extracted from 5, 10, and 15 glomeruli obtained through the microdissection of FFPE renal samples.
PXD022750	34055875	A Small RNA Is Linking CRISPR-Cas and Zinc Transport. 	A small RNA and its involvement in zinc transport	ABC transporter, archaea, metallostasis, small RNAs, transcriptomics	The function and mode of action of small regulatory RNAs is currently still understudied in archaea. In the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii, a plethora of sRNAs have been identified; however, in-depth functional analysis is missing for most of them. We selected a small RNA (s479) from Haloferax volcanii for detailed characterization. The sRNA gene is encoded between a CRISPR RNA locus and the Cas protein gene cluster, and the s479 deletion strain is viable and was characterized in detail. Transcriptome studies of wild-type Haloferax cells and the deletion mutant revealed upregulation of six genes in the deletion strain, showing that this sRNA has a clearly defined function. Three of the six upregulated genes encode potential zinc transporter proteins (ZnuA1, ZnuB1, and ZnuC1) suggesting the involvement of s479 in the regulation of zinc transport. Upregulation of these genes in the deletion strain was confirmed by northern blot and proteome analyses. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate a direct interaction of s479 with the target znuC1 mRNA. Proteome comparison of wild-type and deletion strains further expanded the regulon of s479 deeply rooting this sRNA within the metabolism of H. volcanii especially the regulation of transporter abundance. Interestingly, s479 is not only encoded next to CRISPR-cas genes, but the mature s479 contains a crRNA-like 5' handle, and experiments with Cas protein deletion strains indicate maturation by Cas6 and interaction with Cas proteins. Together, this might suggest that the CRISPR-Cas system is involved in s479 function.
PXD020509	34056188	Benefits of Ion Mobility Separation and Parallel Accumulation-Serial Fragmentation Technology on timsTOF Pro for the Needs of Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Protein Analysis. 	PASEF technology on timsTOF Pro improves quality of FPOP analysis	FPOP, PASEF, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, TIMS, hydroxyl radical, protein footprinting, timsTOF	Fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) is a recently developed technique for studying protein folding, conformations, interactions, etc. In this method, hydroxyl radicals, usually generated by KrF laser photolysis of H2O2, are used for irreversible labeling of solvent-exposed side chains of amino acids. Mapping of the oxidized residues to the protein's structure requires pinpointing of modifications using a bottom-up proteomic approach. In this work, a quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer coupled with trapped ion mobility spectrometry (timsTOF Pro) was used for identification of oxidative modifications in a model protein. Multiple modifications on the same residues, including six modifications of histidine, were successfully resolved. Moreover, parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) technology allows successful sequencing of even minor populations of modified peptides. The data obtained indicate a clear improvement of the quality of the FPOP analysis from the viewpoint of the number of identified peptides bearing oxidative modifications and their precise localization. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD020509.
PXD014352	34056205	Tubulin Beta 2C Chain (TBB2C), a Potential Marker of Ovarian Cancer, an Insight from Ovarian Cancer Proteome Profile. 	Tissue Proteome Profiling of Ovarian cancer.	2D-PAGE, ELISA, Ovarian cancer, Proteome profiling, Western blotting	Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal among female reproductive system malignancies. Depending upon the stage at presentation, the five year survival ratio varies from ~92 to ~30%. The role of biomarkers in early cancer diagnosis, including OC, is well understood. In our previous study, through an initial screening, we have analyzed eleven proteins that exhibited differential expression in OC using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-GE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis. In continuation of our previous study, the present work describes analysis of twenty more proteins that showed aberrant expression in OC. Among these, six showed consistent significant deregulation in the OC false discovery rate [FDR <= 0.05]. Upon MS analysis, they were identified as vimentin, tubulin beta 2C chain, tubulin alpha 1C chain, actin cytoplasmic 2, apolipoprotein A-I, and collagen alpha 2(VI) chain [peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) score >= 79]. One of the differentially regulated proteins, tubulin beta 2C chain, was found to be significantly (fold change, 2.5) enhanced in OC. Verification by western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated that the tubulin beta 2C chain may serve as a valuable marker for OC (ANOVA p < 0.0001). The assessment of the likely association of TBB2C with OC in a larger population will not only help in developing clinically useful biomarkers in the future but also improve our understanding of the progression of OC disease.
PXD022283	34058021	Alterations in the CO2 availability induce alterations in the phosphoproteome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. 	Alterations in the CO2 availability induce alterations in the phospho-proteome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803	SpkC, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, bicarbonate transport, carbon acclimation, cyanobacteria, mutant, phosphorylation, protein kinase	Cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes that perform plant-like oxygenic photosynthesis. They evolved an inorganic carbon-concentrating mechanism to adapt to low CO2 conditions. Quantitative phosphoproteomics was applied to analyze regulatory features during the acclimation to low CO2 conditions in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Overall, more than 2500 proteins were quantified, equivalent to c. 70% of the Synechocystis theoretical proteome. Proteins with changing abundances correlated largely with mRNA expression levels. Functional annotation of the noncorrelating proteins revealed an enrichment of key metabolic processes fundamental for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Furthermore, 105 phosphoproteins harboring over 200 site-specific phosphorylation events were identified. Subunits of the bicarbonate transporter BCT1 and the redox switch protein CP12 were among phosphoproteins with reduced phosphorylation levels at lower CO2 , whereas the serine/threonine protein kinase SpkC revealed increased phosphorylation levels. The corresponding DeltaspkC mutant was characterized and showed decreased ability to acclimate to low CO2 conditions. Possible phosphorylation targets of SpkC including a BCT1 subunit were identified by phosphoproteomics. Collectively, our study highlights the importance of posttranscriptional regulation of protein abundances as well as posttranslational regulation by protein phosphorylation for the successful acclimation towards low CO2 conditions in Synechocystis and possibly among cyanobacteria.
PXD021511	34060205	Lysine demethylase LSD1 delivered via small extracellular vesicles promotes gastric cancer cell stemness. 	Small extracellular vesicles-delivered LSD1 promotes gastric cancer cell stemness	LSD1, Small extracellular vesicles, gastric cancer, stemness	Several studies have examined the functions of nucleic acids in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). However, much less is known about the protein cargos of sEVs and their functions in recipient cells. This study demonstrates the presence of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which is the first identified histone demethylase, in the culture medium of gastric cancer cells. We show that sEVs derived from gastric cancer cells and the plasma of patients with gastric cancer harbor LSD1. The shuttling of LSD1-containing sEVs from donor cells to recipient gastric cancer cells promotes cancer cell stemness by positively regulating the expression of Nanog, OCT4, SOX2, and CD44. Additionally, sEV-delivered LSD1 suppresses oxaliplatin response of recipient cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas LSD1-depleted sEVs do not. Taken together, we demonstrate that LSD1-loaded sEVs can promote stemness and chemoresistance to oxaliplatin. These findings suggest that the LSD1 content of sEV could serve as a biomarker to predict oxaliplatin response in gastric cancer patients.
PXD015293	34061533	Complement and Coagulation Cascades are Potentially Involved in Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in alpha-Synuclein-Based Mouse Models of Parkinson's Disease. 	Quantitative proteome analyses of two types of Parkinson's disease mouse model revealed potential pathways of the pathogenesis	Parkinsons disease, SILAM, alpha-synuclein	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder that results in motor dysfunction and, eventually, cognitive impairment. alpha-Synuclein protein is known as a central protein to the pathophysiology of PD, but the underlying pathological mechanism still remains to be elucidated. In an effort to understand how alpha-synuclein underlies the pathology of PD, various PD mouse models with alpha-synuclein overexpression have been developed. However, systemic analysis of the brain proteome of those mouse models is lacking. In this study, we established two mouse models of PD by injecting alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) or by inducing overexpression of human A53T alpha-synuclein to investigate common pathways in the two different types of the PD mouse models. For more accurate quantification of mouse brain proteome, the proteins were quantified using the method of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in mammals . We identified a total of 8355 proteins from the two mouse models; ~6800 and ~7200 proteins from alpha-synuclein PFF-injected mice and human A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice, respectively. Through pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins common to both PD mouse models, it was discovered that the complement and coagulation cascade pathways were enriched in the PD mice compared to control animals. Notably, a validation study demonstrated that complement component 3 (C3)-positive astrocytes were increased in the ventral midbrain of the intrastriatal alpha-synuclein PFF-injected mice and C3 secreted from astrocytes could induce the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. This is the first study that highlights the significance of the complement and coagulation pathways in the pathogenesis of PD through proteome analyses with two sophisticated mouse models of PD.
PXD025845	34062387	Acylated peptide enrichment utilizing lysine deacylases for lysine acylomics. 	Acylated peptide enrichment utilizing lysine deacylases for lysine acylomics	acetylated peptide enrichment, acetylproteomics, lysine acetylation	Reversible acylation of lysine epsilon-amino groups, e.g., acetylation, succinylation, maronylation, and myristoylation, is involved in basic physiological processes such as metabolism, cell signaling and aging. In this study, we developed a novel enrichment method for acylated peptides without the use of antibodies, in which endogenously acylated peptides are deacylated by recombinant lysine deacylases based on the enzyme-substrate relationship and enriched by N-hydroxysuccinimidyl chemistry for identification of the acylated sites by nanoscale liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analysis. To demonstrate the validity of this acylomics platform, we used it to identify acylated sites on chemically acylated model protein samples. We also applied it to the nuclei of HeLa cells to identify endogenous acylated sites.
PXD023336	34063504	Protein Kinase C Activation Drives a Differentiation Program in an Oligodendroglial Precursor Model through the Modulation of Specific Biological Networks. 	Protein kinase C activation drives a differentiation program in an oligodendroglial precursor model through the modulation of specific biological networks	PKC, differentiation, oligodendrocytes, signaling	Protein kinase C (PKC) activation induces cellular reprogramming and differentiation in various cell models. Although many effectors of PKC physiological actions have been elucidated, the molecular mechanisms regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation after PKC activation are still unclear. Here, we applied a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach to provide a comprehensive analysis of the proteome expression changes in the MO3.13 oligodendroglial cell line after PKC activation. Our findings suggest that multiple networks that communicate and coordinate with each other may finally determine the fate of MO3.13 cells, thus identifying a modular and functional biological structure. In this work, we provide a detailed description of these networks and their participating components and interactions. Such assembly allows perturbing each module, thus describing its physiological significance in the differentiation program. We applied this approach by targeting the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) in PKC-activated cells. Overall, our findings provide a resource for elucidating the PKC-mediated network modules that contribute to a more robust knowledge of the molecular dynamics leading to this cell fate transition.
PXD024832	34063560	Evidence of a New MoYpd1p Phosphotransferase Isoform in the Multistep Phosphorelay System of Magnaporthe oryzae. 	LC-MS confirmation of alternative YPD1 isoforms from Magnaporthe oryzae	Magnaporthe oryzae, YPD1, alternative splicing, in-gel digest, isoform identification	Different external stimuli are perceived by multiple sensor histidine kinases and transmitted by phosphorylation via the phosphotransfer protein Ypd1p in the multistep phosphorelay system of the high osmolarity glycerol signaling pathway of filamentous fungi. How the signal propagation takes place is still not known in detail since multiple sensor histidine kinase genes in most filamentous fungi are coded in the genome, whereas only one gene for Ypd1p exists. That raises the hypothesis that various Ypd1p isoforms are produced from a single gene sequence, perhaps by alternative splicing, facilitating a higher variability in signal transduction. We found that the mRNA of MoYPD1 in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is subjected to an increased structural variation and amplified putative isoforms on a cDNA level. We then generated mutant strains overexpressing these isoforms, purified the products, and present here one previously unknown MoYpd1p isoform on a proteome level. Alternative splicing was found to be a valid molecular mechanism to increase the signal diversity in eukaryotic multistep phosphorelay systems.
PXD019453	34063651	Endoplasmic Reticulum Subproteome Analysis Reveals Underlying Defense Mechanisms of Wheat Seedling Leaves under Salt Stress. 	Integrated Physiological and Large-Scale Chloroplast Proteome Analysis of Wheat Seedling Leaves  under Salt and PEG-Induced Drought Stresses	Wheat, chloroplast proteome, drought stress., label-free, physiological characteristics, salt stress	Salt stress is the second most important abiotic stress factor in the world, which seriously affects crop growth, development and grain production. In this study, we performed the first integrated physiological and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteome analysis of wheat seedling leaves under salt stress using a label-free-based quantitative proteomic approach. Salt stress caused significant decrease in seedling height, root length, relative water content and chlorophyll content of wheat seedling leaves, indicating that wheat seedling growth was significantly inhibited under salt stress. The ER proteome analysis identified 233 ER-localized differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) in response to salt stress, including 202 upregulated and 31 downregulated proteins. The upregulated proteins were mainly involved in the oxidation-reduction process, transmembrane transport, the carboxylic acid metabolic process, stress response, the arbohydrate metabolic process and proteolysis, while the downregulated proteins mainly participated in the metabolic process, biological regulation and the cellular process. In particular, salt stress induced significant upregulation of protein disulfide isomerase-like proteins and heat shock proteins and significant downregulation of ribosomal protein abundance. Further transcript expression analysis revealed that half of the detected DAP genes showed a consistent pattern with their protein levels under salt stress. A putative metabolic pathway of ER subproteome of wheat seedling leaves in response to salt stress was proposed, which reveals the potential roles of wheat ER proteome in salt stress response and defense.
PXD025649	34064456	Characterization of Extracellular Vesicle Cargo in Sjoegren's Syndrome through a SWATH-MS Proteomics Approach. 	Human salivary extracellular vesicles LC-MS/MS	Extracellular vesicles, SWATH-MS, Saliva, Sjogrens syndrome	Primary Sjoegren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex heterogeneous disease characterized by a wide spectrum of glandular and extra-glandular manifestations. In this pilot study, a SWATH-MS approach was used to monitor extracellular vesicles-enriched saliva (EVs) sub-proteome in pSS patients, to compare it with whole saliva (WS) proteome, and assess differential expressed proteins between pSS and healthy control EVs samples. Comparison between EVs and WS led to the characterization of compartment-specific proteins with a moderate degree of overlap. A total of 290 proteins were identified and quantified in EVs from healthy and pSS patients. Among those, 121 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in pSS, 82% were found to be upregulated, and 18% downregulated in pSS samples. The most representative functional pathways associated to the protein networks were related to immune-innate response, including several members of S100 protein family, annexin A2, resistin, serpin peptidase inhibitors, azurocidin, and CD14 monocyte differentiation antigen. Our results highlight the usefulness of EVs for the discovery of novel salivary-omic biomarkers and open novel perspectives in pSS for the identification of proteins of clinical relevance that could be used not only for the disease diagnosis but also to improve patients' stratification and treatment-monitoring. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025649.
PXD024691	34064677	Ubiquinone Metabolism and Transcription HIF-1 Targets Pathway Are Toxicity Signature Pathways Present in Extracellular Vesicles of Paraquat-Exposed Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells. 	Protein content of extracellular vesicles from human brain microvascular endothelial cells treated by paraquat	BBB, CNS, DIA-MS, HIF-1, endothelia cells, extracellular vesicles, paraquat, ubiquinone metabolism	Over the last decade, the knowledge in extracellular vesicles (EVs) biogenesis and modulation has increasingly grown. As their content reflects the physiological state of their donor cells, these "intercellular messengers" progressively became a potential source of biomarker reflecting the host cell state. However, little is known about EVs released from the human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). The current study aimed to isolate and characterize EVs from HBMECs and to analyze their EVs proteome modulation after paraquat (PQ) stimulation, a widely used herbicide known for its neurotoxic effect. Size distribution, concentration and presence of well-known EV markers were assessed. Identification and quantification of PQ-exposed EV proteins was conducted by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS). Signature pathways of PQ-treated EVs were analyzed by gene ontology terms and pathway enrichment. Results highlighted that EVs exposed to PQ have modulated pathways, namely the ubiquinone metabolism and the transcription HIF-1 targets. These pathways may be potential molecular signatures of the PQ-induced toxicity carried by EVs that are reflecting their cell of origin by transporting with them irreversible functional changes.
PXD023508	34064977	Plasma Protein Biomarkers Associated with Higher Ovarian Cancer Risk in BRCA1/2 Carriers. 	Human plasma LC-MSMS for identified protein biomarker for BRCA1/2 positive ovarian cancer	BRCA carrier, Ovarian cancer, Plasma	Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and in-time diagnosis is limited because of the absence of effective biomarkers. Germline BRCA1/2 genetic alterations are risk factors for hereditary OC; risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is pursued for disease prevention. However, not all healthy carriers develop the disease. Therefore, identifying predictive markers in the BRCA1/2 carrier population could help improve the identification of candidates for preventive RRSO. In this study, plasma samples from 20 OC patients (10 patients with BRCA1/2 wild type (wt) and 10 with the BRCA1/2 variant (var)) and 20 normal subjects (10 subjects with BRCA1/2wt and 10 with BRCA1/2var) were analyzed for potential biomarkers of hereditary OC. We applied a bottom-up proteomics approach, using nano-flow LC-MS to analyze depleted plasma proteome quantitatively, and potential plasma protein markers specific to the BRCA1/2 variant were identified from a comparative statistical analysis of the four groups. We obtained 1505 protein candidates from the 40 subjects, and SPARC and THBS1 were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma SPARC and THBS1 concentrations in healthy BRCA1/2 carriers were found to be lower than in OC patients with BRCA1/2var. If plasma SPARC concentrations increase over 337.35 ng/mL or plasma THBS1 concentrations increase over 65.28 mug/mL in a healthy BRCA1/2 carrier, oophorectomy may be suggested.
PXD025805	34065225	Oxonium Ion Guided Analysis of Quantitative Proteomics Data Reveals Site-Specific O-Glycosylation of Anterior Gradient Protein 2 (AGR2). 	Oxonium ion guided analysis of quantitative proteomics data reveals site-specific O-glycosylation of anterior gradient protein 2 (AGR2)	AGR2, Glycoproteomics, LCâˆ’MS/MS, O-glycosylation, TMT labeling, colorectal cancer, oxonium ion	Developments in mass spectrometry (MS)-based analyses of glycoproteins have been important to study changes in glycosylation related to disease. Recently, the characteristic pattern of oxonium ions in glycopeptide fragmentation spectra had been used to assign different sets of glycopeptides. In particular, this was helpful to discriminate between O-GalNAc and O-GlcNAc. Here, we thought to investigate how such information can be used to examine quantitative proteomics data. For this purpose, we used tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled samples from total cell lysates and secreted proteins from three different colorectal cancer cell lines. Following automated glycopeptide assignment (Byonic) and evaluation of the presence and relative intensity of oxonium ions, we observed that, in particular, the ratio of the ions at m/z 144.066 and 138.055, respectively, could be used to discriminate between O-GlcNAcylated and O-GalNAcylated peptides, with concomitant relative quantification between the different cell lines. Among the O-GalNAcylated proteins, we also observed anterior gradient protein 2 (AGR2), a protein which glycosylation site and status was hitherto not well documented. Using a combination of multiple fragmentation methods, we then not only assigned the site of modification, but also showed different glycosylation between intracellular (ER-resident) and secreted AGR2. Overall, our study shows the potential of broad application of the use of the relative intensities of oxonium ions for the confident assignment of glycopeptides, even in complex proteomics datasets.
PXD067954	34065512	CRL4-DCAF12 Ubiquitin Ligase Controls MOV10 RNA Helicase during Spermatogenesis and T Cell Activation. 	CRL4-DCAF12 Ubiquitin Ligase Controls MOV10 RNA Helicase during Spermatogenesis and T Cell Activation	DatasetType:Proteomics, proteasome, ubiquitin	Multisubunit cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase 4 (CRL4)-DCAF12 recognizes the C-terminal degron containing acidic amino acid residues. However, its physiological roles and substrates are largely unknown. Purification of CRL4-DCAF12 complexes revealed a wide range of potential substrates, including MOV10, an "ancient" RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) complex RNA helicase. We show that DCAF12 controls the MOV10 protein level via its C-terminal motif in a proteasome- and CRL-dependent manner. Next, we generated Dcaf12 knockout mice and demonstrated that the DCAF12-mediated degradation of MOV10 is conserved in mice and humans. Detailed analysis of Dcaf12-deficient mice revealed that their testes produce fewer mature sperms, phenotype accompanied by elevated MOV10 and imbalance in meiotic markers SCP3 and gamma-H2AX. Additionally, the percentages of splenic CD4(+) T and natural killer T (NKT) cell populations were significantly altered. In vitro, activated Dcaf12-deficient T cells displayed inappropriately stabilized MOV10 and increased levels of activated caspases. In summary, we identified MOV10 as a novel substrate of CRL4-DCAF12 and demonstrated the biological relevance of the DCAF12-MOV10 pathway in spermatogenesis and T cell activation.
PXD024714	34065610	Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases Contribute to Anaerobic Fermentative Metabolism in Bacillus cereus. 	Bacillus cereus msrAB mutant strain proteomics under fermentative anoxic conditions, exoproteome	anaerobiosis, bacillus cereus, exoproteome, methionine sulfoxide reductase	Reversible oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide (Met(O)) is a common posttranslational modification occurring on proteins in all organisms under oxic conditions. Protein-bound Met(O) is reduced by methionine sulfoxide reductases, which thus play a significant antioxidant role. The facultative anaerobe Bacillus cereus produces two methionine sulfoxide reductases: MsrA and MsrAB. MsrAB has been shown to play a crucial physiological role under oxic conditions, but little is known about the role of MsrA. Here, we examined the antioxidant role of both MsrAB and MrsA under fermentative anoxic conditions, which are generally reported to elicit little endogenous oxidant stress. We created single- and double-mutant Deltamsr strains. Compared to the wild-type and DeltamsrAB mutant, single- (DeltamsrA) and double- (DeltamsrADeltamsrAB) mutants accumulated higher levels of Met(O) proteins, and their cellular and extracellular Met(O) proteomes were altered. The growth capacity and motility of mutant strains was limited, and their energy metabolism was altered. MsrA therefore appears to play a major physiological role compared to MsrAB, placing methionine sulfoxides at the center of the B. cereus antioxidant system under anoxic fermentative conditions.
PXD025190	34066295	Western Diet Induced Remodelling of the Tongue Proteome. 	Proteomic analysis of the mouse tongue proteome in response to western diet	metabolism, obesity, taste, tongue	The tongue is a heavily innervated and vascularized striated muscle that plays an important role in vocalization, swallowing and digestion. The surface of the tongue is lined with papillae which contain gustatory cells expressing various taste receptors. There is growing evidence to suggest that our perceptions of taste and food preference are remodelled following chronic consumption of Western diets rich in carbohydrate and fats. Our sensitivity to taste and also to metabolising Western diets may be a key factor in the rising prevalence of obesity; however, a systems-wide analysis of the tongue is lacking. Here, we defined the proteomic landscape of the mouse tongue and quantified changes following chronic consumption of a chow or Western diet enriched in lipid, fructose and cholesterol for 7 months. We observed a dramatic remodelling of the tongue proteome including proteins that regulate fatty acid and mitochondrial metabolism. Furthermore, the expressions of several receptors, metabolic enzymes and hormones were differentially regulated, and are likely to provide novel therapeutic targets to alter taste perception and food preference to combat obesity.
PXD025386	34067418	Characterization of PARP6 Function in Knockout Mice and Patients with Developmental Delay. 	Characterization of PARP-6 function in knock out mice and patients with developmental delay	ADP-ribosylation, BioID, MARylation, Orbitrap Fusion, PARP-6, Spectral Counts, dendritic branching, nervous system	PARP6, a member of a family of enzymes (17 in humans) known as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), is a neuronally enriched PARP. While previous studies from our group show that Parp6 is a regulator of dendrite morphogenesis in rat hippocampal neurons, its function in the nervous system in vivo is poorly understood. Here, we describe the generation of a Parp6 loss-of-function mouse model for examining the function of Parp6 during neurodevelopment in vivo. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, we generated a mouse line that expressed a Parp6 truncated variant (Parp6(TR)) in place of Parp6(WT). Unlike Parp6(WT), Parp6(TR) is devoid of catalytic activity. Homozygous Parp6(TR) do not exhibit obvious neuromorphological defects during development, but nevertheless die perinatally. This suggests that Parp6 catalytic activity is important for postnatal survival. We also report PARP6 mutations in six patients with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including microencephaly, intellectual disabilities, and epilepsy. The most severe mutation in PARP6 (C563R) results in the loss of catalytic activity. Expression of Parp6(C563R) in hippocampal neurons decreases dendrite morphogenesis. To gain further insight into PARP6 function in neurons we also performed a BioID proximity labeling experiment in hippocampal neurons and identified several microtubule-binding proteins (e.g., MAP-2) using proteomics. Taken together, our results suggest that PARP6 is an essential microtubule-regulatory gene in mice, and that the loss of PARP6 catalytic activity has detrimental effects on neuronal function in humans.
PXD023352	34067642	Cold Atmospheric-Pressure Plasma Caused Protein Damage in Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Cells in Biofilms. 	Gas plasma combined with antibiotics for the eradication of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilm	Gas plasma, antibiotic, biofilm, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, oxidative damage	Biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant bacteria are a major cause of hospital-acquired infections. Cold atmospheric-pressure plasma (CAP) is attractive for sterilization, especially to disrupt biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not clear. In this study, CAP effectively reduced the living cells in the biofilms formed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and 6 min treatment with CAP reduced the S. aureus cells in biofilms by 3.5 log10. The treatment with CAP caused the polymerization of SaFtsZ and SaClpP proteins in the S. aureus cells of the biofilms. In vitro analysis demonstrated that recombinant SaFtsZ lost its self-assembly capability, and recombinant SaClpP lost its peptidase activity after 2 min of treatment with CAP. Mass spectrometry showed oxidative modifications of a cluster of peaks differing by 16 Da, 31 Da, 32 Da, 47 Da, 48 Da, 62 Da, and 78 Da, induced by reactive species of CAP. It is speculated that the oxidative damage to proteins in S. aureus cells was induced by CAP, which contributed to the reduction of biofilms. This study elucidates the biological effect of CAP on the proteins in bacterial cells of biofilms and provides a basis for the application of CAP in the disinfection of biofilms.
PXD013901	34068436	Biophysical and Biochemical Comparison of Extracellular Vesicles Produced by Infective and Non-Infective Stages of Trypanosoma cruzi. 	Trypanosoma cruzi PAN 4 exosomes LC-MS/MS	Exosomes, Trypanosoma, epimastigote, trypomastigote	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small lipid vesicles released by either any prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell, or both, with a biological role in cell-to-cell communication. In this work, we characterize the proteomes and nanomechanical properties of EVs released by tissue-culture cell-derived trypomastigotes (mammalian infective stage; (TCT)) and epimastigotes (insect stage; (E)) of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease. EVs of each stage were isolated by differential centrifugation and analyzed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Measurements of zeta-potential were also included. Results show marked differences in the surface molecular cargos of EVs between both stages, with a noteworthy expansion of all groups of trans-sialidase proteins in trypomastigote's EVs. In contrast, chromosomal locations of trans-sialidases of EVs of epimastigotes were dramatically reduced and restricted to subtelomeric regions, indicating a possible regulatable expression of these proteins between both stages of the parasite. Regarding mechanical properties, EVs of trypomastigotes showed higher adhesion compared to the EVs of epimastigotes. These findings demonstrate the remarkable surface remodeling throughout the life cycle of T. cruzi, which shapes the physicochemical composition of the extracellular vesicles and could have an impact in the ability of these vesicles to participate in cell communication in completely different niches of infection.
PXD025816	34068790	Proteomic Identification of Bombyx mori Organelles Using the Engineered Ascorbate Peroxidase APEX and Development of Silkworm Organelle Proteome Database (SilkOrganPDB). 	Identification of Silkworm Organelle Proteome	Organelle, Silkworm	Silkworm Bombyx mori is an economically important insect and a lepidopteran model. Organelle proteome is vital to understanding gene functions; however, it remains to be identified in silkworm. Here, using the engineered ascorbate peroxidase APEX, we constructed transgenic B. mori embryo cells (BmE) expressing APEX-NLS, COX4-APEX, APEX-Rev, and APEX-KDEL in nucleus, mitochondrial matrix (MM), cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and isolated the biotin-labeled proteins using streptavidin-affinity purification, respectively. The isolated proteins were determined using LC-MS/MS and annotated by searching B. mori genomes downloaded from GenBank, SilkBase, SilkDB 2.0, and SilkDB 3.0, resulting in 842, 495, 311, and 445 organelle proteins identified, respectively. We mapped the 296 MM proteins annotated in the GenBank data to mitochondrial protein databases of the fly, human, and mouse, and found that 140 (47%) proteins are homologous to 80 fly proteins, and 65 (22%) proteins match to 31 and 29 human and mouse proteins, respectively. Protein orthology was predicted in multiple insects using OrthoMCL, producing 460 families containing 839 proteins we identified. Out of 460 families, 363 were highly conserved and found in all insects, leaving only three proteins without orthology in other insects, indicating that the identified proteins are highly conserved and probably play important roles in insects. A gene ontology enrichment analysis by clusterProfiler revealed that the nucleus proteins significantly enriched in cellular component terms of nucleus and nucleolus, the MM proteins markedly enriched in molecular function terms of nucleotide binding, and the cytosol proteins mainly enriched in biological process terms of small molecule metabolism. To facilitate the usage and analysis of our data, we developed an open-access database, Silkworm Organelle Proteome Database (SilkOrganPDB), which provides multiple modules for searching, browsing, downloading, and analyzing these proteins, including BLAST, HMMER, Organelle Proteins, Protein Locations, Sequences, Gene Ontology, Homologs, and Phylogeny. In summary, our work revealed the protein composition of silkworm BmE organelles and provided a database resource helpful for understanding the functions and evolution of these proteins.
PXD023449	34070083	Impacts of the Type I Toxin-Antitoxin System, SprG1/SprF1, on Staphylococcus aureus Gene Expression. 	Staphylococcus aureus toxin-antitoxin system	S. aureus, cell death, toxin-antitoxin system	Type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are widespread genetic modules in bacterial genomes. They express toxic peptides whose overexpression leads to growth arrest or cell death, whereas antitoxins regulate the expression of toxins, acting as labile antisense RNAs. The Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) genome contains and expresses several functional type I TA systems, but their biological functions remain unclear. Here, we addressed and challenged experimentally, by proteomics, if the type I TA system, the SprG1/SprF1 pair, influences the overall gene expression in S. aureus. Deleted and complemented S. aureus strains were analyzed for their proteomes, both intracellular and extracellular, during growth. Comparison of intracellular proteomes among the strains points to the SprF1 antitoxin as moderately downregulating protein expression. In the strain naturally expressing the SprG1 toxin, cytoplasmic proteins are excreted into the medium, but this is not due to unspecific cell leakages. Such a toxin-driven release of the cytoplasmic proteins may modulate the host inflammatory response that, in turn, could amplify the S. aureus infection spread.
PXD023489	34070185	Proteomic Profile of Saliva in Parkinson's Disease Patients: A Proof of Concept Study. 	Proteomic profile of saliva in Parkinson's disease patients.	LC-MS-MS, Parkinson disease, salivary proteom	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It affects many organs. Lewy bodies-a histopathological "hallmark" of PD-are detected in about 75% of PD submandibular gland samples. We hypothesize that saliva can be a source of biomarkers of PD. The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the salivary proteome of PD patients and healthy controls (HC). Salivary samples from 39 subjects (24 PD patients, mean age 61.6 +/- 8.2; 15 HC, mean age 60.9 +/- 6.7) were collected. Saliva was collected using RNA-Pro-Sal kits. Label-free LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry was performed to characterize the proteome of the saliva. IPA analysis of upstream inhibitors was performed. A total of 530 proteins and peptides were identified. We observed lower concentrations of S100-A16, ARP2/3, and VPS4B in PD group when compared to HC. We conclude that the salivary proteome composition of PD patients is different than that of healthy controls. We observed a lower concentration of proteins involved in inflammatory processes, exosome formation, and adipose tissue formation. The variability of expression of proteins between the two groups needs to be considered.
PXD026077	34070491	Mitochondrial Retrograde Signaling Contributes to Metabolic Differentiation in Yeast Colonies. 	Mitochondrial retrograde signaling contributes to metabolic differentiation in yeast colonies - Proteomics of BY4742, BY-rtg1, BY-mks1, BY-rtg1mks1 and BY-rtg2mks1.	Mitochondrial retrograde signaling	During development of yeast colonies, various cell subpopulations form, which differ in their properties and specifically localize within the structure. Three branches of mitochondrial retrograde (RTG) signaling play a role in colony development and differentiation, each of them activating the production of specific markers in different cell types. Here, aiming to identify proteins and processes controlled by the RTG pathway, we analyzed proteomes of individual cell subpopulations from colonies of strains, mutated in genes of the RTG pathway. Resulting data, along with microscopic analyses revealed that the RTG pathway predominantly regulates processes in U cells, long-lived cells with unique properties, which are localized in upper colony regions. Rtg proteins therein activate processes leading to amino acid biosynthesis, including transport of metabolic intermediates between compartments, but also repress expression of mitochondrial ribosome components, thus possibly contributing to reduced mitochondrial translation in U cells. The results reveal the RTG pathway's role in activating metabolic processes, important in U cell adaptation to altered nutritional conditions. They also point to the important role of Rtg regulators in repressing mitochondrial activity in U cells.
PXD026064	34070587	Identification of Candidate Protein Biomarkers for CIN2+ Lesions from Self-Sampled, Dried Cervico-Vaginal Fluid Using LC-MS/MS. 	Dried human cervico vagnial fluid on FTA-cards LC-MS/MS	CVF, FTA-card, cerivcal cancer	Molecular screening programs for cervical cancer detect the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) in cell material or vaginal fluids. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV is a necessary pre-requisite, but the majority of infections do not lead to pathological states. Additional biomarkers are needed to increase the specificity of the molecular tests. Here, we have investigated the possibility of detecting protein biomarkers using mass spectrometry from dried self-sampled cervico-vaginal fluid deposited on FTA cards. We found significant intra-individual correlations (p < 2.2 x 10(-16)), although heterogenous protein profiles were obtained between individuals. Out of 3699 proteins found in total, 169 were detected in at least 95% of the samples. Using a discovery/replication design, 18 proteins were found to be significant in the discovery cohort, with higher values in those cases compared to controls. All of these were found to also have higher levels among the cases in the replication cohort, with one protein (DEAD-Box Helicase) remaining statistically significant. Finally, a predictive 7-protein multivariate model was developed with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.55, respectively. Our results demonstrate that robust measurements of protein biomarkers can be obtained from self-sampled dried CVF and that these could be used to predict cervical cancer pre-stages.
PXD022829	34070749	Diminazene Aceturate Stabilizes Atherosclerotic Plaque and Attenuates Hepatic Steatosis in apoE-Knockout Mice by Influencing Macrophages Polarization and Taurine Biosynthesis. 	Diminazene aceturate (DIZE) stabilizes atherosclerotic plaques and attenuates hepatic steatosis in apolipoprotein E knockout mice by influencing macrophages polarization and taurine biosynthesis	ACE2, DIZE, apoE-knockout mice, atherosclerosis, fatty liver, macrophages polarization	Atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the Western countries. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with its two main opposing effectors, i.e., angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang-(1-7), is widely recognized as a major regulator of cardiovascular function and body metabolic processes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) by breaking-down Ang II forms Ang-(1-7) and thus favors Ang-(1-7) actions. Therefore, the aim of our study was to comprehensively evaluate the influence of prolonged treatment with ACE2 activator, diminazene aceturate (DIZE) on the development of atherosclerotic lesions and hepatic steatosis in apoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). We have shown that DIZE stabilized atherosclerotic lesions and attenuated hepatic steatosis in apoE(-/-) mice fed an HFD. Such effects were associated with decreased total macrophages content and increased alpha-smooth muscle actin levels in atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, DIZE changed polarization of macrophages towards increased amount of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in the atherosclerotic lesions. Interestingly, the anti-steatotic action of DIZE in the liver was related to the elevated levels of HDL in the plasma, decreased levels of triglycerides, and increased biosynthesis and concentration of taurine in the liver of apoE(-/-) mice. However, exact molecular mechanisms of both anti-atherosclerotic and anti-steatotic actions of DIZE require further investigations.
PXD025585	34071747	Identification and Relative Quantification of hFSH Glycoforms in Women's Sera via MS-PRM-Based Approach. 	Identification and relative quantification of hFSH glycoforms in women sera by PRM MS based approach.	FSH, Glycosylation, PRM-Mass Spectrometry	Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a glycohormone synthesized by adenohypophysis, and it stimulates ovulation in women and spermatogenesis in men by binding to its receptor (FSHR). FSHR is involved in several mechanisms to transduce intracellular signals in response to the FSH stimulus. Exogenous FSH is currently used in the clinic for ovarian hyperstimulation during in vitro fertilization in women, and for treatment of infertility caused by gonadotropin deficiency in men. The glycosylation of FSH strongly affects the binding affinity to its receptor, hence significantly influencing the biological activity of the hormone. Therefore, the accurate measurement and characterization of serum hFSH glycoforms will contribute to elucidating the complex mechanism of action by which different glycoforms elicit distinct biological activity. Nowadays ELISA is the official method with which to monitor serum hFSH, but the test is unable to distinguish between the different FSH glycovariants and is therefore unsuitable to study the biological activity of this hormone. This study presents a preliminary alternative strategy for identifying and quantifying serum hFSH glycoforms based on immunopurification assay and mass spectrometry (MS), and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis. In this study, we provide an MS-PRM data acquisition method for hFSH glycopeptides identification with high specificity and their quantification by extracting the chromatographic traces of selected fragments of glycopeptides. Once set up for all its features, the proposed method could be transferred to the clinic to improve fertility treatments and follow-ups in men and women.
PXD024947	34072643	Comparative Proteomic Profiling: Cellular Metabolisms Are Mainly Affected in Senecavirus A-Inoculated Cells at an Early Stage of Infection. 	Comparative proteomic profiling: cellular metabolisms are mainly affected in Senecavirus A-inoculated cells at an early stage of infection	Differentially expressed protein, Enrichment analysis, Metabolism, Pathway., Senecavirus A	Senecavirus A (SVA), also known as Seneca Valley virus, belongs to the genus Senecavirus in the family Picornaviridae. SVA can cause vesicular disease and epidemic transient neonatal losses in pigs. This virus efficiently propagates in some non-pig-derived cells, like the baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell line and its derivate (BSR-T7/5). Conventionally, a few proteins or only one protein is selected for exploiting a given mechanism concerning cellular regulation after SVA infection in vitro. Proteomics plays a vital role in the analysis of protein profiling, protein-protein interactions, and protein-directed metabolisms, among others. Tandem mass tag-labeled liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with the parallel reaction monitoring technique is increasingly used for proteomic research. In this study, this combined method was used to uncover separately proteomic profiles of SVA- and non-infected BSR-T7/5 cells. Furthermore, both proteomic profiles were compared with each other. The proteomic profiling showed that a total of 361 differentially expressed proteins were identified, out of which, 305 and 56 were upregulated and downregulated in SVA-infected cells at 12 h post-inoculation, respectively. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analyses showed that cellular metabolisms were affected mainly in SVA-inoculated cells at an early stage of infection. Therefore, an integrated metabolic atlas remains to be explored via metabolomic methods.
PXD025188	34072711	Quantitative Proteomic and Microcystin Production Response of Microcystis aeruginosa to Phosphorus Depletion. 	Investigation on the quantitative proteomic responses of bloom-forming Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa to phosphorus depletion and starvation by the method of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)	Microcystis aeruginosa, iTRAQ, phosphorus	Microcystis blooms are the most widely distributed and frequently occurring cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater. Reducing phosphorus is suggested to be effective in mitigating cyanobacterial blooms, while the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. In the present study, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics was employed to study the effects of phosphorus depletion on Microcystis aeruginosa FACHB-905. The production of microcystins (MCs), a severe hazard of Microcystis blooms, was also analyzed. In total, 230 proteins were found to be differentially abundant, with 136 downregulated proteins. The results revealed that, upon phosphorus limitation stress, Microcystis aeruginosa FACHB-905 raised the availability of phosphorus primarily by upregulating the expression of orthophosphate transport system proteins, with no alkaline phosphatase producing ability. Phosphorus depletion remarkably inhibited cell growth and the primary metabolic processes of Microcystis, including transcription, translation and photosynthesis, with structures of photosystems remaining intact. Moreover, expression of nitrogen assimilation proteins was downregulated, while proteins involved in carbon catabolism were significantly upregulated, which was considered beneficial for the intracellular balance among carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The expression of MC synthetase was not significantly different upon phosphorus depletion, while MC content was significantly suppressed. It is assumed that phosphorus depletion indirectly regulates the production of MC by the inhibition of metabolic processes and energy production. These results contribute to further understanding of the influence mechanisms of phosphorus depletion on both biological processes and MC production in Microcystis cells.
PXD026340	34072942	Modulation of Early Neutrophil Granulation: The Circulating Tumor Cell-Extravesicular Connection in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma. 	Modulation of Early Neutrophil Granulation: The Circulating Tumor Cell-Extravesicular Connection in Pancreatic Ductal  Adenocarcinoma	circulating tumor cells, clusters, extracellular vesicles, granule mobilization, neutrophil degranulation, pancreatic cancer, retep-lase activity	Tumor cells dissociate from the primary site and enter into systemic circulation (circulating tumor cells, CTCs) either alone or as tumor microemboli (clusters); the latter having an increased predisposition towards forming distal metastases than single CTCs. The formation of clusters is, in part, created by contacts between cell-cell junction proteins and/or cytokine receptor pairs with other cells such as neutrophils, platelets, fibroblasts, etc. In the present study, we provide evidence for an extravesicular (EV) mode of communication between pancreatic cancer CTCs and neutrophils. Our results suggest that the EV proteome of CTCs contain signaling proteins that can modulate degranulation and granule mobilization in neutrophils and, also, contain tissue plasminogen activator and other proteins that can regulate cluster formation. By exposing naive neutrophils to EVs isolated from CTCs, we further show how these changes are modulated in a dynamic fashion indicating evidence for a deeper EV based remodulatory effect on companion cells in clusters.
PXD025759	34073856	A Novel Method for Creating a Synthetic L-DOPA Proteome and In Vitro Evidence of Incorporation. 	A novel method for creating a synthetic L-DOPA proteome and in vitro evidence of incorporation.	L-DOPA, Levodopa, Misincorporation, PTM, post translational modifications	Proteinopathies are protein misfolding diseases that have an underlying factor that affects the conformation of proteoforms. A factor hypothesised to play a role in these diseases is the incorporation of non-protein amino acids into proteins, with a key example being the therapeutic drug levodopa. The presence of levodopa as a protein constituent has been explored in several studies, but it has not been examined in a global proteomic manner. This paper provides a proof-of-concept method for enzymatically creating levodopa-containing proteins using the enzyme tyrosinase and provides spectral evidence of in vitro incorporation in addition to the induction of the unfolded protein response due to levodopa.
PXD024844	34074003	Age-Related Alterations in the Testicular Proteome of a Non-Human Primate. 	Age-related alterations in the testicular proteome of a non-human primate	Aging, TPCs, Testis, senescence, testicular aging, testicular peritubular cells	Aging of human testis and associated cellular changes is difficult to assess. Therefore, we used a translational, non-human primate model to get insights into underlying cellular and biochemical processes. Using proteomics and immunohistochemistry, we analyzed testicular tissue of young (age 2 to 3) and old (age 10 to 12) common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we identified 63,124 peptides, which could be assigned to 5924 proteins. Among them, we found proteins specific for germ cells and somatic cells, such as Leydig and Sertoli cells. Quantitative analysis showed 31 differentially abundant proteins, of which 29 proteins were more abundant in older animals. An increased abundance of anti-proliferative proteins, among them CDKN2A, indicate reduced cell proliferation in old testes. Additionally, an increased abundance of several small leucine rich repeat proteoglycans and other extracellular matrix proteins was observed, which may be related to impaired cell migration and fibrotic events. Furthermore, an increased abundance of proteins with inhibitory roles in smooth muscle cell contraction like CNN1 indicates functional alterations in testicular peritubular cells and may mirror a reduced capacity of these cells to contract in old testes.
PXD013926	34074205	Silencing PEX26 as an unconventional mode to kill drug-resistant cancer cells and forestall drug resistance. 	Increasing Pexophagy as an Unconventional Mode to Kill Cancer Cells	Peroxisome, autophagy, cancer, exportomer, metabolism, pexophagy	Promoting the macroautophagy/autophagy-mediated degradation of specific proteins and organelles can potentially be utilized to induce apoptosis in cancer cells or sensitize tumor cells to therapy. To examine this concept, we enriched for autophagosomes from histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)-sensitive U937 lymphoma cells and isogenic HDACi-resistant cells. Mass spectrometry on autophagosome-enriched fractions revealed that HDACi-resistant cells undergo elevated pexophagy, or autophagy of the peroxisome, an organelle that supports tumor growth. To disturb peroxisome homeostasis, we enhanced pexophagy in HDACi-resistant cells via genetic silencing of peroxisome exportomer complex components (PEX1, PEX6, or PEX26). This consequently sensitized resistant cells to HDACi-mediated apoptosis, which was rescued by inhibiting ATM/ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM serine/threonine kinase), a mediator of pexophagy. We subsequently engineered melanoma cells to stably repress PEX26 using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi). Melanoma cells with repressed PEX26 expression showed evidence of both increased pexophagy and peroxisomal matrix protein import defects versus single guide scrambled (sgSCR) controls. In vivo studies showed that sgPEX26 melanoma xenografts recurred less compared to sgSCR xenografts, following the development of resistance to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-targeted therapy. Finally, prognostic analysis of publicly available datasets showed that low expression levels of PEX26, PEX6 and MTOR, were significantly associated with prolonged patient survival in lymphoma, lung cancer and melanoma cohorts. Our work highlighted that drugs designed to disrupt peroxisome homeostasis may serve as unconventional therapies to combat therapy resistance in cancer.Abbreviations: ABCD3/PMP70: ATP binding cassette subfamily D member 3; ACOX1: acyl-CoA oxidase 1; AP: autophagosome; COX: cytochrome c oxidase; CQ: chloroquine; CRISPRi: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference; DLBCL: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; GO: gene ontology; dCas9: Cas9 endonuclease dead, or dead Cas9; HDACi: histone deacetylase inhibitors; IHC: Immunohistochemistry; LAMP2: lysosomal associated membrane protein 2; LCFAs: long-chain fatty acids; LFQ-MS: label-free quantitation mass spectrometry; LPC: lysophoshatidylcholine; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; PBD: peroxisome biogenesis disorders; PTS1: peroxisomal targeting signal 1; ROS: reactive oxygen species; sgRNA: single guide RNA; VLCFAs: very-long chain fatty acids; Vor: vorinostat; WO: wash-off.
PXD016237	34074698	Tripartite Separation of Glomerular Cell Types and Proteomes from Reporter-Free Mice. 	FACS sorted podocytes, mesangial cells	endothelia, mesangial cells, podocytes	BACKGROUND: The glomerulus comprises podocytes, mesangial cells, and endothelial cells, which jointly determine glomerular filtration. Understanding this intricate functional unit beyond the transcriptome requires bulk isolation of these cell types for biochemical investigations. We developed a globally applicable tripartite isolation method for murine mesangial and endothelial cells and podocytes (timMEP). METHODS: We separated glomerular cell types from wild-type or mT/mG mice via a novel FACS approach, and validated their purity. Cell type proteomes were compared between strains, ages, and sex. We applied timMEP to the podocyte-targeting, immunologic, THSD7A-associated, model of membranous nephropathy. RESULTS: timMEP enabled protein-biochemical analyses of podocytes, mesangial cells, and endothelial cells derived from reporter-free mice, and allowed for the characterization of podocyte, endothelial, and mesangial proteomes of individual mice. We identified marker proteins for mesangial and endothelial proteins, and outlined protein-based, potential communication networks and phosphorylation patterns. The analysis detected cell type-specific proteome differences between mouse strains and alterations depending on sex, age, and transgene. After exposure to anti-THSD7A antibodies, timMEP resolved a fine-tuned initial stress response, chiefly in podocytes, that could not be detected by bulk glomerular analyses. The combination of proteomics with super-resolution imaging revealed a specific loss of slit diaphragm, but not of other foot process proteins, unraveling a protein-based mechanism of podocyte injury in this animal model. CONCLUSION: timMEP enables glomerular cell type-resolved investigations at the transcriptional and protein-biochemical level in health and disease, while avoiding reporter-based artifacts, paving the way toward the comprehensive and systematic characterization of glomerular cell biology.
PXD015602	34074767	ALS-linked PFN1 variants exhibit loss and gain of functions in the context of formin-induced actin polymerization. 	IP-MS of ALS-linked PFN1 variants	ALS, PFN1, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, diaphanous, formin, profilin 1	Profilin-1 (PFN1) plays important roles in modulating actin dynamics through binding both monomeric actin and proteins enriched with polyproline motifs. Mutations in PFN1 have been linked to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, whether ALS-linked mutations affect PFN1 function has remained unclear. To address this question, we employed an unbiased proteomics analysis in mammalian cells to identify proteins that differentially interact with mutant and wild-type (WT) PFN1. These studies uncovered differential binding between two ALS-linked PFN1 variants, G118V and M114T, and select formin proteins. Furthermore, both variants augmented formin-mediated actin assembly relative to PFN1 WT. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed mutation-induced changes in the internal dynamic couplings within an alpha helix of PFN1 that directly contacts both actin and polyproline, as well as structural fluctuations within the actin- and polyproline-binding regions of PFN1. These data indicate that ALS-PFN1 variants have the potential for heightened flexibility in the context of the ternary actin-PFN1-polyproline complex during actin assembly. Conversely, PFN1 C71G was more severely destabilized than the other PFN1 variants, resulting in reduced protein expression in both transfected and ALS patient lymphoblast cell lines. Moreover, this variant exhibited loss-of-function phenotypes in the context of actin assembly. Perturbations in actin dynamics and assembly can therefore result from ALS-linked mutations in PFN1. However, ALS-PFN1 variants may dysregulate actin polymerization through different mechanisms that depend upon the solubility and stability of the mutant protein.
PXD024534	34075030	Discovery of a cooperative mode of inhibiting RIPK1 kinase. 	Discovery of a cooperative mode of inhibiting RIPK1	Nec-1s, Nec-34, RIPK1	RIPK1, a death domain-containing kinase, has been recognized as an important therapeutic target for inhibiting apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammation under pathological conditions. RIPK1 kinase inhibitors have been advanced into clinical studies for the treatment of various human diseases. One of the current bottlenecks in developing RIPK1 inhibitors is to discover new approaches to inhibit this kinase as only limited chemotypes have been developed. Here we describe Necrostatin-34 (Nec-34), a small molecule that inhibits RIPK1 kinase with a mechanism distinct from known RIPK1 inhibitors such as Nec-1s. Mechanistic studies suggest that Nec-34 stabilizes RIPK1 kinase in an inactive conformation by occupying a distinct binding pocket in the kinase domain. Furthermore, we show that Nec-34 series of compounds can synergize with Nec-1s to inhibit RIPK1 in vitro and in vivo. Thus, Nec-34 defines a new strategy to target RIPK1 kinase and provides a potential option of combinatorial therapy for RIPK1-mediated diseases.
PXD023584	34075209	Exome reanalysis and proteomic profiling identified TRIP4 as a novel cause of cerebellar hypoplasia and spinal muscular atrophy (PCH1). 	Exome reanalysis and proteomic profiling identified TRIP4 as a novel cause of cerebellar hypoplasia and spinal muscular atrophy (PCH1)	PCH1, SOLVE-RD, TRIP4, exome reanalysis, proteogenomics	TRIP4 is one of the subunits of the transcriptional coregulator ASC-1, a ribonucleoprotein complex that participates in transcriptional coactivation and RNA processing events. Recessive variants in the TRIP4 gene have been associated with spinal muscular atrophy with bone fractures as well as a severe form of congenital muscular dystrophy. Here we present the diagnostic journey of a patient with cerebellar hypoplasia and spinal muscular atrophy (PCH1) and congenital bone fractures. Initial exome sequencing analysis revealed no candidate variants. Reanalysis of the exome data by inclusion in the Solve-RD project resulted in the identification of a homozygous stop-gain variant in the TRIP4 gene, previously reported as disease-causing. This highlights the importance of analysis reiteration and improved and updated bioinformatic pipelines. Proteomic profile of the patient's fibroblasts showed altered RNA-processing and impaired exosome activity supporting the pathogenicity of the detected variant. In addition, we identified a novel genetic form of PCH1, further strengthening the link of this characteristic phenotype with altered RNA metabolism.
PXD025903	34075669	Synthesis and Cellular Labeling of Multifunctional Phosphatidylinositol Bis- and Trisphosphate Derivatives. 	Trifunctional PIP3 binder identification	HeLa, PIP3, trifunctional	We synthesized the first multifunctionalized phosphoinositide polyphosphate derivatives featuring a photo-removable protecting group ("cage"), a photo-crosslinkable diazirine group, and a terminal alkyne group useful for click chemistry. We demonstrate that the lipid derivatives readily enter cells. After photo-crosslinking, cell fixation and fluorescent tagging via click chemistry, we determined the intracellular location of the lipid derivatives before and after uncaging of the lipids. We find that there is rapid trafficking of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 derivatives to the plasma membrane, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved. We employed the photo-crosslinking and click chemistry functions to analyze the proteome of PI(3,4,5)P3 -binding proteins. From the latter, we validated by RNAi that the putative lipid binding proteins ATP11A and MPP6 are involved in the transport of PI(3,4,5)P3 to the plasma membrane.
PXD015171	34075748	Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Knockdown of CD44 Promotes Proliferation and Migration in Claudin-Low MDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T Breast Cancer Cell Lines. 	Quantitative Proteomics implicates CD44 in proliferation of breast cancer cell	Breast Cancer, CD44, TMT	CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that can regulate the oncogenic process. This is known to be a marker of the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, as well as a cancer stem cell marker. However, its functional regulatory roles are poorly understood in claudin-low breast cancer. To gain comprehensive insight into the function of CD44, we performed an in-depth tandem mass tag-based proteomic analysis of two claudin-low breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T) transfected with CD44 siRNA. As a result, we observed that 2736 proteins were upregulated and 2172 proteins were downregulated in CD44-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells. For Hs 578T CD44-knockdown cells, 412 proteins were upregulated and 443 were downregulated. Gene ontology and network analyses demonstrated that the suppression of this marker mediates significant functional alterations related to oncogenic cellular processes, including proliferation, metabolism, adhesion, and gene expression regulation. A functional study confirmed that CD44 knockdown inhibited proliferation by regulating the expression of genes related to cell cycle, translation, and transcription. Moreover, this promoted the expression of multiple cell adhesion-associated proteins and attenuated cancer cell migration. Finally, our proteomic study defines the landscape of the CD44-regulated proteome of claudin-low breast cancer cells, revealing changes that mediate cell proliferation and migration. Our proteomics data set has been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE repository with the data set identifier PXD015171.
PXD024967	34077217	Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Urine from COVID-19 Patients for Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Antigen and to Study Host Response. 	Mass spectrometric analysis of urine from COVID-19 patients for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen and to study host response	Antigen detection, COVID-19 Urine, Covid-19, Host response, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, Quantitative proteomics	SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a major public health burden and affects many organs including lungs, kidneys, the liver, and the brain. Although the virus is readily detected and diagnosed using nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), detection of its presence in body fluids is fraught with difficulties. A number of published studies have failed to detect viral RNA by RT-PCR methods in urine. Although microbial identification in clinical microbiology using mass spectrometry is undertaken after culture, here we undertook a mass spectrometry-based approach that employed an enrichment step to capture and detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein directly from urine of COVID-19 patients without any culture. We detected SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-derived peptides from 13 out of 39 urine samples. Further, a subset of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative urine samples validated by mass spectrometry were used for the quantitative proteomics analysis. Proteins with increased abundance in urine of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals were enriched in the acute phase response, regulation of complement system, and immune response. Notably, a number of renal proteins such as podocin (NPHS2), an amino acid transporter (SLC36A2), and sodium/glucose cotransporter 5 (SLC5A10), which are intimately involved in normal kidney function, were decreased in the urine of COVID-19 patients. Overall, the detection of viral antigens in urine using mass spectrometry and alterations of the urinary proteome could provide insights into understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
PXD025548	34077228	Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics Reveals the Abnormal Brain Glucose Catabolism in Depression Based on Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress Rats. 	Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics reveals the abnormal brain glucose catabolism in depression based on chronic unpredictable mild stress rats	brain glucose catabolism, depression, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, mitochondrial structure and function, stable isotope-resolved metabolomics	The severe harm of depression to human life has attracted great attention to neurologists, but its pathogenesis is extremely complicated and has not yet been fully elaborated. Here, we provided a new strategy for revealing the specific pathways of abnormal brain glucose catabolism in depression, based on the supply of energy substrates and the evaluation of the mitochondrial structure and function. By using stable isotope-resolved metabolomics, we discovered that the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) is blocked and gluconeogenesis is abnormally activated in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rats. In addition, our results showed an interesting phenomenon that the brain attempted to activate all possible metabolic enzymes in energy-producing pathways, but CUMS rats still exhibited a low TCA cycle activity due to impaired mitochondria. Depression caused the mitochondrial structure and function to be impaired and then led to abnormal brain glucose catabolism. The combination of the stable isotope-resolved metabolomics and mitochondrial structure and function analysis can accurately clarify the mechanism of depression. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier and acetyl-CoA may be the key targets for depression treatment. The strategy provides a unique insight for exploring the mechanism of depression, the discovery of new targets, and the development of ideal novel antidepressants. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025548.
PXD025262	34077720	Uncovering the RNA-binding protein landscape in the pluripotency network of human embryonic stem cells. 	The nuclear RNA-interactome of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)	RBPome, RBPs, RIC, RNA-binding proteins, RNA-binding proteome, RNA-interactome capture, hESCs, human embryonic stem cells, nuclear RNA interactome	Embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and cell fate decisions are driven by a broad array of molecular signals. While transcriptional regulators have been extensively studied in human ESCs (hESCs), the extent to which RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) contribute to human pluripotency remains unclear. Here, we carry out a proteome-wide screen and identify 810 proteins that bind RNA in hESCs. We reveal that RBPs are preferentially expressed in hESCs and dynamically regulated during early stem cell differentiation. Notably, many RBPs are affected by knockdown of OCT4, a master regulator of pluripotency, several dozen of which are directly targeted by this factor. Using cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP-seq), we find that the pluripotency-associated STAT3 and OCT4 transcription factors interact with RNA in hESCs and confirm the binding of STAT3 to the conserved NORAD long-noncoding RNA. Our findings indicate that RBPs have a more widespread role in human pluripotency than previously appreciated.
PXD024749	34078606	Structure of the merozoite surface protein 1 from Plasmodium falciparum. 	CX-MS of merozoite surface protein-1	MSP-1	The merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) is the most abundant protein on the surface of the erythrocyte-invading Plasmodium merozoite, the causative agent of malaria. MSP-1 is essential for merozoite formation, entry into and escape from erythrocytes, and is a promising vaccine candidate. Here, we present monomeric and dimeric structures of full-length MSP-1. MSP-1 adopts an unusual fold with a large central cavity. Its fold includes several coiled-coils and shows structural homology to proteins associated with membrane and cytoskeleton interactions. MSP-1 formed dimers through these domains in a concentration-dependent manner. Dimerization is affected by the presence of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton protein spectrin, which may compete for the dimerization interface. Our work provides structural insights into the possible mode of interaction of MSP-1 with erythrocytes and establishes a framework for future investigations into the role of MSP-1 in Plasmodium infection and immunity.
PXD024292	34078910	NEK9 regulates primary cilia formation by acting as a selective autophagy adaptor for MYH9/myosin IIA. 	LC-MS/MS analysis of FLAG-NEK9 immunoprecipitates	Mouse embryonic fibroblast	Autophagy regulates primary cilia formation, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we identify NIMA-related kinase 9 (NEK9) as a GABARAPs-interacting protein and find that NEK9 and its LC3-interacting region (LIR) are required for primary cilia formation. Mutation in the LIR of NEK9 in mice also impairs in vivo cilia formation in the kidneys. Mechanistically, NEK9 interacts with MYH9 (also known as myosin IIA), which has been implicated in inhibiting ciliogenesis through stabilization of the actin network. MYH9 accumulates in NEK9 LIR mutant cells and mice, and depletion of MYH9 restores ciliogenesis in NEK9 LIR mutant cells. These results suggest that NEK9 regulates ciliogenesis by acting as an autophagy adaptor for MYH9. Given that the LIR in NEK9 is conserved only in land vertebrates, the acquisition of the autophagic regulation of the NEK9-MYH9 axis in ciliogenesis may have possible adaptive implications for terrestrial life.
PXD025351	34078911	Transcriptome-(phospho)proteome characterization of brain of a germline model of cytoplasmic-predominant Pten expression with autism-like phenotypes. 	(Phospho)Proteomic Characterization of Ptenm3m4 Cortex	Pten, autism	PTEN has a strong Mendelian association with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), representing a special case in autism's complex genetic architecture. Animal modeling for constitutional Pten mutation creates an opportunity to study how disruption of Pten affects neurobiology and glean potential insight into ASD pathogenesis. Subsequently, we comprehensively characterized the neural (phospho)proteome of Pten(m3m4/m3m4) mice, which exhibits cytoplasmic-predominant Pten expression, by applying mass spectrometry technology to their brains at two-weeks- (P14) and six-weeks-of-age (P40). The differentially expressed/phosphorylated proteins were subjected to gene enrichment, pathway, and network analyses to assess the affected biology. We identified numerous differentially expressed/phosphorylated proteins, finding greater dysregulation at P40 consistent with prior transcriptomic data. The affected pathways were largely related to PTEN function or neurological processes, while scant direct overlap was found across datasets. Network analysis pointed to ASD risk genes like Pten and Psd-95 as major regulatory hubs, suggesting they likely contribute to initiation or maintenance of cellular and perhaps organismal phenotypes related to ASD.
PXD015528	34079125	A proximity-dependent biotinylation map of a human cell. 	Go_BioID_humancellmap_HEK293_ER-mito_candidates_2019	BioID, Proximity-dependent biotinylation, human cell map, organelle proteomics	Compartmentalization is a defining characteristic of eukaryotic cells, and partitions distinct biochemical processes into discrete subcellular locations. Microscopy(1) and biochemical fractionation coupled with mass spectrometry(2-4) have defined the proteomes of a variety of different organelles, but many intracellular compartments have remained refractory to such approaches. Proximity-dependent biotinylation techniques such as BioID provide an alternative approach to define the composition of cellular compartments in living cells(5-7). Here we present a BioID-based map of a human cell on the basis of 192 subcellular markers, and define the intracellular locations of 4,145 unique proteins in HEK293 cells. Our localization predictions exceed the specificity of previous approaches, and enabled the discovery of proteins at the interface between the mitochondrial outer membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum that are crucial for mitochondrial homeostasis. On the basis of this dataset, we created humancellmap.org as a community resource that provides online tools for localization analysis of user BioID data, and demonstrate how this resource can be used to understand BioID results better.
PXD015426	34079127	Hepatic stellate cells suppress NK cell-sustained breast cancer dormancy. 	Analysis of sectreted proteins from breast cancer cells	LC-MS, conditioned media, secretome	The persistence of undetectable disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) after primary tumour resection poses a major challenge to effective cancer treatment(1-3). These enduring dormant DTCs are seeds of future metastases, and the mechanisms that switch them from dormancy to outgrowth require definition. Because cancer dormancy provides a unique therapeutic window for preventing metastatic disease, a comprehensive understanding of the distribution, composition and dynamics of reservoirs of dormant DTCs is imperative. Here we show that different tissue-specific microenvironments restrain or allow the progression of breast cancer in the liver-a frequent site of metastasis(4) that is often associated with a poor prognosis(5). Using mouse models, we show that there is a selective increase in natural killer (NK) cells in the dormant milieu. Adjuvant interleukin-15-based immunotherapy ensures an abundant pool of NK cells that sustains dormancy through interferon-gamma signalling, thereby preventing hepatic metastases and prolonging survival. Exit from dormancy follows a marked contraction of the NK cell compartment and the concurrent accumulation of activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSCs). Our proteomics studies on liver co-cultures implicate the aHSC-secreted chemokine CXCL12 in the induction of NK cell quiescence through its cognate receptor CXCR4. CXCL12 expression and aHSC abundance are closely correlated in patients with liver metastases. Our data identify the interplay between NK cells and aHSCs as a master switch of cancer dormancy, and suggest that therapies aimed at normalizing the NK cell pool might succeed in preventing metastatic outgrowth.
PXD024455	34079900	Comprehensive Structure-Activity Profiling of Micheliolide and its Targeted Proteome in Leukemia Cells via Probe-Guided Late-Stage C-H Functionalization. 	Comprehensive Structure-Activity Profiling of Micheliolide and its Targeted Proteome in Leukemia Cells via Probe-Guided Late-Stage Câ€”H Functionalization	C-H functionalization, biocatalysis, competitive pull-down, leukemia stem cells, multi-probe proteomics, sesquiterpene lactones	The plant-derived sesquiterpene lactone micheliolide was recently found to possess promising antileukemic activity, including the ability to target and kill leukemia stem cells. Efforts toward improving the biological activity of micheliolide and investigating its mechanism of action have been hindered by the paucity of preexisting functional groups amenable for late-stage derivatization of this molecule. Here, we report the implementation of a probe-based P450 fingerprinting strategy to rapidly evolve engineered P450 catalysts useful for the regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of micheliolide at two previously inaccessible aliphatic positions in this complex natural product. Via P450-mediated chemoenzymatic synthesis, a broad panel of novel micheliolide analogs could thus be obtained to gain structure-activity insights into the effect of C2, C4, and C14 substitutions on the antileukemic activity of micheliolide, ultimately leading to the discovery of "micheliologs" with improved potency against acute myelogenic leukemia cells. These late-stage C-H functionalization routes could be further leveraged to generate a panel of affinity probes for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the protein targeting profile of micheliolide in leukemia cells via chemical proteomics analyses. These studies introduce new micheliolide-based antileukemic agents and shed new light onto the biomolecular targets and mechanism of action of micheliolide in leukemia cells. More broadly, this work showcases the value of the present P450-mediated C-H functionalization strategy for streamlining the late-stage diversification and elucidation of the biomolecular targets of a complex bioactive molecule.
PXD024923	34081200	Ubiquitylome analysis reveals the involvement of ubiquitination in the bast fiber growth of ramie. 	Ubiquitylome of ramie stem bark	Ubiquitylome, ramie	MAIN CONCLUSION: A total of 249 sites from 197 proteins showed a differential ubiquitination level in the fiber development of ramie barks. The function of two differentially ubiquitinated proteins for fiber growth was demonstrated. Ubiquitination is one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins, and it plays essential roles in plant growth and development. However, the involvement of ubiquitination in the growth of plant fibers remains largely unknown. We compared the ubiquitylome of the top and middle stems of ramie bark, with different fiber growth stages. We identified 249 differentially ubiquitinated sites in 197 proteins in fiber-developing barks in the stems and found that seven were homologs of Arabidopsis proteins associated with fiber growth. Overexpression of the differentially ubiquitinated proteins, RWA3 homolog whole_GLEAN_10024150 and MYB protein whole_GLEAN_10015497, significantly promoted fiber growth in transgenic Arabidopsis, indicating their involvement in this process. We also found that the abundance of these proteins decreased when their ubiquitination levels increased and vice versa in the fiber-developing bark. These results indicated that the abundance of these two proteins was adjusted through ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Collectively, our findings provide important insights into the involvement of ubiquitination in the growth of ramie fibers.
PXD025629	34081912	SARS-CoV-2 infects human pancreatic beta cells and elicits beta cell impairment. 	SARS-CoV-2 infects human pancreatic beta-cells and elicits beta-cell impairment	SARS-CoV-2, beta-cells, pancreas	Emerging evidence points toward an intricate relationship between the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and diabetes. While preexisting diabetes is associated with severe COVID-19, it is unclear whether COVID-19 severity is a cause or consequence of diabetes. To mechanistically link COVID-19 to diabetes, we tested whether insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 and cause beta cell depletion. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, and related entry factors (TMPRSS2, NRP1, and TRFC) are expressed in beta cells, with selectively high expression of NRP1. We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 infects human pancreatic beta cells in patients who succumbed to COVID-19 and selectively infects human islet beta cells in vitro. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection attenuates pancreatic insulin levels and secretion and induces beta cell apoptosis, each rescued by NRP1 inhibition. Phosphoproteomic pathway analysis of infected islets indicates apoptotic beta cell signaling, similar to that observed in type 1 diabetes (T1D). In summary, our study shows SARS-CoV-2 can directly induce beta cell killing.
PXD025681	34082787	Extracellular riboflavin induces anaerobic biofilm formation in Shewanella oneidensis. 	Proteomic analysis of Shewanella oneidensis overexpressing or not the putrescin decarboxylase speC	Shewanella oneidensis, biofilm formation, nanoLC-MS/MS, putrescin decarboxylase speC, riboflavin production	BACKGROUND: Some microorganisms can respire with extracellular electron acceptors using an extended electron transport chain to the cell surface. This process can be applied in bioelectrochemical systems in which the organisms produce an electrical current by respiring with an anode as electron acceptor. These organisms apply flavin molecules as cofactors to facilitate one-electron transfer catalyzed by the terminal reductases and in some cases as endogenous electron shuttles. RESULTS: In the model organism Shewanella oneidensis, riboflavin production and excretion trigger a specific biofilm formation response that is initiated at a specific threshold concentration, similar to canonical quorum-sensing molecules. Riboflavin-mediated messaging is based on the overexpression of the gene encoding the putrescine decarboxylase speC which leads to posttranscriptional overproduction of proteins involved in biofilm formation. Using a model of growth-dependent riboflavin production under batch and biofilm growth conditions, the number of cells necessary to produce the threshold concentration per time was deduced. Furthermore, our results indicate that specific retention of riboflavin in the biofilm matrix leads to localized concentrations, which by far exceed the necessary threshold value. CONCLUSION: This study describes a new quorum-sensing mechanism in S. oneidensis. Biofilm formation of S. oneidensis is induced by low concentrations of riboflavin resulting in an upregulation of the ornithine-decarboxylase speC. The results can be applied for the development of strains catalyzing increased current densities in bioelectrochemical systems.
PXD020215	34083602	A multiplexed nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) assay for simultaneously detecting glycosyl hydrolase and lignin modifying enzyme activities. 	Development of a multiplexed platform to study laccases and cellulase activities using nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS)	Enzyme assays, GHs (glycosyl hydrolases), Laccases, Lignin, Multiplex assay, NIMS	Lignocellulosic biomass is composed of three major biopolymers: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Analytical tools capable of quickly detecting both glycan and lignin deconstruction are needed to support the development and characterization of efficient enzymes/enzyme cocktails. Previously we have described nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry-based assays for the analysis of glycosyl hydrolase and most recently an assay for lignin modifying enzymes. Here we integrate these two assays into a single multiplexed assay against both classes of enzymes and use it to characterize crude commercial enzyme mixtures. Application of our multiplexed platform based on nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry enabled us to characterize crude mixtures of laccase enzymes from fungi Agaricus bisporus (Ab) and Myceliopthora thermophila (Mt) revealing activity on both carbohydrate and aromatic substrates. Using time-series analysis we determined that crude laccase from Ab has the higher GH activity and that laccase from Mt has the higher activity against our lignin model compound. Inhibitor studies showed a significant reduction in Mt GH activity under low oxygen conditions and increased activities in the presence of vanillin (common GH inhibitor). Ultimately, this assay can help to discover mixtures of enzymes that could be incorporated into biomass pretreatments to deconstruct diverse components of lignocellulosic biomass.
PXD018834	34083746	The chaperonin CCT8 controls proteostasis essential for T cell maturation, selection, and function. 	Chaperonin CCT8 is essential for T cell development and function	T cell, T cell development	T cells rely for their development and function on the correct folding and turnover of proteins generated in response to a broad range of molecular cues. In the absence of the eukaryotic type II chaperonin complex, CCT, T cell activation induced changes in the proteome are compromised including the formation of nuclear actin filaments and the formation of a normal cell stress response. Consequently, thymocyte maturation and selection, and T cell homeostatic maintenance and receptor-mediated activation are severely impaired. In the absence of CCT-controlled protein folding, Th2 polarization diverges from normal differentiation with paradoxical continued IFN-gamma expression. As a result, CCT-deficient T cells fail to generate an efficient immune protection against helminths as they are unable to sustain a coordinated recruitment of the innate and adaptive immune systems. These findings thus demonstrate that normal T cell biology is critically dependent on CCT-controlled proteostasis and that its absence is incompatible with protective immunity.
PXD024102	34084130	Tengdan Capsule Prevents Hypertensive Kidney Damage in SHR by Inhibiting Periostin-Mediated Renal Fibrosis. 	Tengdan Capsule Prevents Hypertensive Kidney Damage in SHR by Inhibiting Periostin-mediated Renal Fibrosis	Periostin, TGFbeta/SMAD signaling pathway, Teng Dan Capsule, human kidney HEK293 cells, hypertension-induced Kidney damage, inflammatory response	BACKGROUND: Hypertension-induced renal damage is a serious and complex condition that has not been effectively treated by conventional blood pressure-lowering drugs. Tengdan capsule (TDC) is a China FDA-approved compound herbal medicine for treating hypertension; however, its chemical basis and pharmacological efficacy have not been fully investigated in a preclinical setting. METHODS: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to identify and quantify the major chemical components of TDC extracted from ultrapure water. Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age/sex-matched Wistar Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY) were both treated with TDC, losartan, or saline for one month, and their blood pressure (BP) was monitored at the same time by tail-cuff BP system. Biochemical indexes such as urine creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were determined. Kidney tissue sections were examined with (H&E), and Masson staining to evaluate the pathological effect of TDC on SHR's kidneys. After TDC treatment, the differentially expressed proteins in the kidneys of SHR were identified by the TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis, which may provide the targets and possible mechanisms of TDC action. In addition, Western blot analysis, RT-qPCR, and ELISA assays were carried out to further verify the proteomics findings. Finally, two different models involving in vitro renal injuries were established using human kidney HEK293 cells; and the molecular mechanism of TDC kidney protection was demonstrated. RESULTS: Seven chemical compounds, namely Notoginsenoside R1, Ginsenoside RG1, Ginsenoside Re, Ginsenoside Rb1, Sodium Danshensu, Protocatechualdehyde, and Salvianolic acid B, were identified and quantified from the water-soluble extracts of TDC by HPLC. In vivo study using rats showed that TDC effectively reduced BP, BUN, and CRE levels and attenuated renal fibrosis in SHR, and ameliorated damage to the kidneys. Proteomics and subsequent bioinformatics analyses indicated that periostin-mediated inflammatory response and TGFbeta/Smad signaling pathway proteins were closely related to the therapeutic effect of TDC in rat kidneys. Western blot analysis and RT-qPCR showed that TDC markedly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of periostin in renal tissues compared to the untreated SHR. In addition, TGF-beta and COL1A1 mRNA levels also decreased in SHR renal tissues following TDC treatment. In vitro studies showed that low to medium doses of TDC down-regulated the expression of periostin in the injury model of HEK293 cell. In addition, medium to high doses of TDC significantly inhibited collagen deposition in TGFbeta1-induced HEK293 cell fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Major components from the compound herbal medicine Tengdan Capsule are identified and quantified. TDC effectively lowers blood pressure and protects against renal damage caused by hypertension in SHR. Mechanistically, TDC blocks periostin by regulating the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway in the kidney, both in vivo and in vitro. Preventing periostin-mediated renal fibrosis and inflammation might be a promising strategy for treating a hypertensive renal injury.
PXD025299	34084765	Semi-Automated Glycoproteomic Data Analysis of LC-MS Data Using GlycopeptideGraphMS in Process Development of Monoclonal Antibody Biologics. 	Semi-automated Glycoproteomic Data Analysis of LC-MS data using GlycopeptideGraphMS in Lead and Process Development of Biologics	BioAccord, Biologics, Glycoproteomic, GraphMS, IgG, Process Development, adalimumab, trastuzumab	The glycosylation of antibody-based proteins is vital in translating the right therapeutic outcomes of the patient. Despite this, significant infrastructure is required to analyse biologic glycosylation in various unit operations from biologic development, process development to QA/QC in bio-manufacturing. Simplified mass spectrometers offer ease of operation as well as the portability of method development across various operations. Furthermore, data analysis would need to have a degree of automation to relay information back to the manufacturing line. We set out to investigate the applicability of using a semiautomated data analysis workflow to investigate glycosylation in different biologic development test cases. The workflow involves data acquisition using a BioAccord LC-MS system with a data-analytical tool called GlycopeptideGraphMS along with Progenesis QI to semi-automate glycoproteomic characterisation and quantitation with a LC-MS1 dataset of a glycopeptides and peptides. Data analysis which involved identifying glycopeptides and their quantitative glycosylation was performed in 30 min with minimal user intervention. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the antibody and biologic glycopeptide assignment in various scenarios akin to biologic development activities, we demonstrate the effectiveness in the filtering of IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses from human serum IgG as well as innovator drugs trastuzumab and adalimumab and glycoforms by virtue of their glycosylation pattern. We demonstrate a high correlation between conventional released glycan analysis with fluorescent tagging and glycopeptide assignment derived from GraphMS. GraphMS workflow was then used to monitor the glycoform of our in-house trastuzumab biosimilar produced in fed-batch cultures. The demonstrated utility of GraphMS to semi-automate quantitation and qualitative identification of glycopeptides proves to be an easy data analysis method that can complement emerging multi-attribute monitoring (MAM) analytical toolsets in bioprocess environments.
PXD023070	34087424	Obesity-associated deterioration of the hippocampus is partially restored after weight loss. 	Obesity-associated deterioration of the hippocampus is partially restored after weight loss - AWL_ContA	cognition, hippocampus, ketogenic diet, neurogenesis, obesity, weight loss	OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a multidimensional condition that is treatable by the restoration of a lean phenotype; however, some obesity-related outcomes may persist after weight normalization. Among the organs of the human body, the brain possesses a relatively low regenerative capacity and could retain perturbations established as a result of developmental obesity. Calorie restriction (CR) or a restricted ketogenic diet (KD) are successfully used as weight loss approaches, but their impact on obesity-related effects in the brain have not been previously evaluated. METHODS: We performed a series of experiments in a rat model of developmental obesity induced by a 12-week cafeteria diet, followed by CR to implement weight loss. First, we assessed the impact of obesity on neurogenesis (BrdU incorporation into the hippocampus), cognitive function (water maze), and concomitant changes in hippocampal protein expression (GC/MS-MS, western blot). Next, we repeated these experiments in a rat model of weight loss induced by CR. We also measured mitochondrial enzyme activity in rats after weight loss during the fed or fasting state. This study was extended by additional experiments with restricted KD used as a weight loss approach in order to compare the efficacy of two different nutritional interventions used in the treatment of obesity on hippocampal functions. By using a modified version of the water maze we evaluated cognitive abilities in rats subjected to weight loss by CR or a restricted KD. RESULTS: In this study, obesity affected metabolic processes, upregulated hippocampal NF-kappaB, and induced proteomic differences which were associated with impaired cognition and neurogenesis. Weight loss improved neurogenesis and enhanced cognition. While the expression pattern of some proteins persisted after weight loss, most of the changes appeared de novo revealing metabolic adjustment by overactivation of citrate synthase and downregulation of ATP synthase. As a consequence of fasting, the activity of these enzymes indicated hippocampal adaptation to negative energy balance during the weight loss phase of CR. Moreover, the effects on cognitive abilities measured after weight loss were negatively correlated with the animal weight measured at the final stage of weight gain. This was alleviated by KD, which improved cognition when used as a weight loss approach. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that cognition and mitochondrial metabolism in the hippocampus are affected by CR- or KD-induced weight loss.
PXD022633	34087483	The Effect of Interferons on Presentation of Defective Ribosomal Products as HLA Peptides. 	The effect of interferons on presentation of defective ribosome products as HLA peptides	DRiPs, HLA peptides, IFNs, MHC	A subset of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-bound peptides is produced from immature proteins that are rapidly degraded after synthesis. These defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) have been implicated in early alert of the immune system about impending infections. Interferons are important cytokines, produced in response to viral infection, that modulate cellular metabolism and gene expression patterns, increase the presentation of MHC molecules, and induce rapid degradation of proteins and cell-surface presentation of their derived MHC peptides, thereby contributing to the battle against pathogen infections. This study evaluated the role of interferons in the induction of rapid degradation of DRiPs to modulate the repertoire of DRiP-derived MHC peptides. Cultured human breast cancer cells were treated with interferons, and the rates of synthesis and degradation of cellular protein and their degradation products were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis, following the rates of incorporation of heavy stable isotope-labeled amino acids (dynamic stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, dynamic SILAC) at several time points after the interferon application. Large numbers of MHC peptides that incorporated the heavy amino acids faster than their source proteins indicated that DRiP peptides were abundant in the MHC peptidome; interferon treatment increased by about twofold their relative proportions in the peptidome. Such typical DRiP-derived MHC peptides were from the surplus subunits of the proteasome and ribosome, which are degraded because of the transition to immunoproteasomes and a new composition of ribosomes incorporating protein subunits that are induced by the interferon. We conclude that degradation of surplus subunits induced by the interferon is a major source for DRiP-MHC peptides, a phenomenon relevant to coping with viral infections, where a rapid presentation of MHC peptides derived from excess viral proteins may help alert the immune system about the impending infection.
PXD022757	34088668	Budding yeast relies on G1 cyclin specificity to couple cell cycle progression with morphogenetic development. 	Budding yeast relies on qualitative G1 cyclin specificity to couple cell cycle progression with morphogenetic development	Cdk, TMT, cell cycle, cyclin, cyclin-dependent kinase, phosphoproteomics	Two models have been put forward for cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) control of the cell cycle. In the qualitative model, cell cycle events are ordered by distinct substrate specificities of successive cyclin waves. Alternatively, in the quantitative model, the gradual rise of Cdk activity from G1 phase to mitosis leads to ordered substrate phosphorylation at sequential thresholds. Here, we study the relative contributions of qualitative and quantitative Cdk control in Saccharomyces cerevisiae All S phase and mitotic cyclins can be replaced by a single mitotic cyclin, albeit at the cost of reduced fitness. A single cyclin can also replace all G1 cyclins to support ordered cell cycle progression, fulfilling key predictions of the quantitative model. However, single-cyclin cells fail to polarize or grow buds and thus cannot survive. Our results suggest that budding yeast has become dependent on G1 cyclin specificity to couple cell cycle progression to essential morphogenetic events.
PXD022348	34088870	Mapping of m(6)A and Its Regulatory Targets in Prostate Cancer Reveals a METTL3-Low Induction of Therapy Resistance. 	Mapping of m6A and Its Regulatory Targets in Prostate Cancer Reveals a METTL3-low Induction of Therapy Resistance	METTL3, m6A, prostate cancer	Recent evidence has highlighted the role of N (6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in the regulation of mRNA expression, stability, and translation, supporting a potential role for posttranscriptional regulation mediated by m(6)A in cancer. Here, we explore prostate cancer as an exemplar and demonstrate that low levels of N (6)-adenosine-methyltransferase (METTL3) is associated with advanced metastatic disease. To investigate this relationship, we generated the first prostate m(6)A maps, and further examined how METTL3 regulates expression at the level of transcription, translation, and protein. Significantly, transcripts encoding extracellular matrix proteins are consistently upregulated with METTL3 knockdown. We also examined the relationship between METTL3 and androgen signaling and discovered the upregulation of a hepatocyte nuclear factor-driven gene signature that is associated with therapy resistance in prostate cancer. Significantly, METTL3 knockdown rendered the cells resistant to androgen receptor antagonists via an androgen receptor-independent mechanism driven by the upregulation of nuclear receptor NR5A2/LRH-1. IMPLICATIONS: These findings implicate changes in m(6)A as a mechanism for therapy resistance in metastatic prostate cancer.
PXD021998	34089863	Proteomic Dissection of the Impact of Environmental Exposures on Mouse Seminal Vesicle Function. 	Proteomic dissection of the impact of environmental exposures on mouse seminal vesicle function	Acrylamide, Seminal Vesicle	Seminal vesicles are an integral part of the male reproductive accessory gland system. They produce a complex array of secretions containing bioactive constituents that support gamete function and promote reproductive success, with emerging evidence suggesting these secretions are influenced by our environment. Despite their significance, the biology of seminal vesicles remains poorly defined. Here, we complete the first proteomic assessment of mouse seminal vesicles and assess the impact of the reproductive toxicant acrylamide. Mice were administered acrylamide (25 mg/kg bw/day) or control daily for five consecutive days prior to collecting seminal vesicle tissue. A total of 5013 proteins were identified in the seminal vesicle proteome with bioinformatic analyses identifying cell proliferation, protein synthesis, cellular death, and survival pathways as prominent biological processes. Secreted proteins were among the most abundant, and several proteins are linked with seminal vesicle phenotypes. Analysis of the effect of acrylamide on the seminal vesicle proteome revealed 311 differentially regulated (FC +/- 1.5, p <= 0.05, 205 up-regulated, 106 downregulated) proteins, orthogonally validated via immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Pathways that initiate protein synthesis to promote cellular survival were prominent among the dysregulated pathways, and rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR, p = 6.69E-07) was a top-ranked upstream driver. Oxidative stress was implicated as contributing to protein changes, with acrylamide causing an increase in 8-OHdG in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (fivefold increase, p = 0.016) and the surrounding smooth muscle layer (twofold increase, p = 0.043). Additionally, acrylamide treatment caused a reduction in seminal vesicle secretion weight (36% reduction, p = 0.009) and total protein content (25% reduction, p = 0.017). Together these findings support the interpretation that toxicant exposure influences male accessory gland physiology and highlights the need to consider the response of all male reproductive tract tissues when interpreting the impact of environmental stressors on male reproductive function.
PXD021997	34089896	Proteomic profile of human stem cells from dental pulp and periodontal ligament. 	Proteomic profile of human stem cells from dental pulp and periodontal ligament	2DE, DPSCs, Nerve regeneration, PDLSCs, Quantitative proteomics	Background The study of molecular profiling of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) contributes to understanding the high proliferation ability and multi-lineage differentiation potential. Objectives The aim of the study was to compare the protein abundance and specific markers of DPSCs and PDLSCs by protein profiles. Material and methods The DPSCs and PDLSCs extracted from the same tooth were lysed with 3 biological replicates and the protein was collected. Two-dimensional electrophoresis technology and TMT proteomics were used to separate and identify proteins. The data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021997. The RT-qPCR detection of mRNA expression revealed a special marker for distinguishing two kinds of dental stem cells. Results Compared with PDLSCs, 962 differential proteins (DAPs) were up-regulated, and 127 were down-regulated in DPSCs. In the up-regulated DAPs, two high-scoring sub-networks were detected for neural-related molecules, which encode cell vesicle transport and mitochondrial energy transfer to regulate cell proliferation and secretion factors. A large number of cell adhesion molecules were distinguished among the highly expressed molecules of PDLSCs, supporting that stem cells provide cell attachment functions. It was interpreted ENPL, HS90A and HS90B were highly expressed in DPSCs, while CKB was highly abundant in PDLSCs. Another cell group confirmed that these molecules can be used as special biomarkers to identify and distinguish between DPSCs and PDLSCs. Conclusions This study can promote the basic research and clinical application of dental stem cells. Significance The high-throughput protein profiles were tested by combining two-dimensional gel proteomics and TMT-based proteomics. The proteomics of DPSCs and PDLSCs without individual difference demonstrated an accurate and comprehensive molecular expression profiles and interpretation of neural application potential, this study promotes the basic research of dental stem cells and clinical application.
PXD022124	34089898	Leveraging the partition selection bias to achieve a high-quality clustering of mass spectra. 	A Bothrops jararaca venom subproteome to benchmark a spectral clustering algorithm by controlling the selection bias	Algorithm, Bothrops jararaca, Spectral clustering, Venomics	In proteomics, the identification of peptides from mass spectral data can be mathematically described as the partitioning of mass spectra into clusters (i.e., groups of spectra derived from the same peptide). The way partitions are validated is just as important, having evolved side by side with the clustering algorithms themselves and given rise to many partition assessment measures. An assessment measure is said to have a selection bias if, and only if, the probability that a randomly chosen partition scoring a high value depends on the number of clusters in the partition. In the context of clustering mass spectra, this might mislead the validation process to favor clustering algorithms that generate too many (or few) spectral clusters, regardless of the underlying peptide sequence. A selection bias toward the number of peptides is desirable for proteomics as it estimates the number of peptides in a complex protein mixture. Here, we introduce an assessment measure that is purposely biased toward the number of peptide ion species. We also introduce a partition assessment framework for proteomics, called the Partition Assessment Tool, and demonstrate its importance by evaluating the performance of eight clustering algorithms on seven proteomics datasets while discussing the trade-offs involved. SIGNIFICANCE: Clustering algorithms are widely adopted in proteomics for undertaking several tasks such as speeding up search engines, generating consensus mass spectra, and to aid in the classification of proteomic profiles. Choosing which algorithm is most fit for the task at hand is not simple as each algorithm has advantages and disadvantages; furthermore, specifying clustering parameters is also a necessary and fundamental step. For example, deciding on whether to generate "pure clusters" or fewer clusters but accepting noise. With this as motivation, we verify the performance of several widely adopted algorithms on proteomic datasets and introduce a theoretical framework for drawing conclusions on which approach is suitable for the task at hand.
PXD017033	34093861	Site-specific glycoproteomic analysis revealing increased core-fucosylation on FOLR1 enhances folate uptake capacity of HCC cells to promote EMT. 	Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines LC-MS/MS	EMT, Hepatocellular carcinoma, glycoproteome, intact glycopeptide, site-specific glycosylation	Rationale: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been recognized as an important step toward high invasion and metastasis of many cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while the mechanism for EMT promotion is still ambiguous. Methods: The dynamic alterations of site-specific glycosylation during HGF/TGF-beta1-induced EMT process of three HCC cell lines were systematically investigated using precision glycoproteomic methods. The possible roles of EMT-related glycoproteins and site-specific glycans were further confirmed by various molecular biological approaches. Results: Using mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomic methods, we totally identified 2306 unique intact glycopeptides from SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cell lines, and found that core-fucosylated glycans were accounted for the largest proportion of complex N-glycans. Through quantification analysis of intact glycopeptides, we found that the majority of core-fucosylated intact glycopeptides from folate receptor alpha (FOLR1) were up-regulated in the three HGF-treated cell lines. Similarly, core-fucosylation of FOLR1 were up-regulated in SMMC-7721 and Hep3B cells with TGF-beta1 treatment. Using molecular approaches, we further demonstrated that FUT8 was a driver for HGF/TGF-beta1-induced EMT. The silencing of FUT8 reduced core-fucosylation and partially blocked the progress of HGF-induced EMT. Finally, we confirmed that the level of core-fucosylation on FOLR1 especially at the glycosite Asn-201 positively regulated the cellular uptake capacity of folates, and enhanced uptake of folates could promote the EMT of HCC cells. Conclusions: Based on the results, we proposed a potential pathway for HGF or TGF-beta1-induced EMT of HCC cells: HGF or TGF-beta1 treatment of HCC cells can increase the expression of glycosyltransferase FUT8 to up-regulate the core-fucosylation of N-glycans on glycoproteins including the FOLR1; core-fucosylation on FOLR1 can then enhance the folate uptake capacity to finally promote the EMT progress of HCC cells.
PXD015051	34096591	Identification of an RNA sponge that controls the RoxS riboregulator of central metabolism in Bacillus subtilis. 	Identification of an RNA sponge that controls the levels, processing and efficacy of the RoxS riboregulator of central metabolism in B. subtilis	Bacillus subtilis, RNAs, RosA, RoxS, metabolism	sRNAs are a taxonomically-restricted but transcriptomically-abundant class of post-transcriptional regulators. While of major importance for adaption to the environment, we currently lack global-scale methodology enabling target identification, especially in species without known RNA hub proteins (e.g. Hfq). Using psoralen RNA cross-linking and Illumina-sequencing we identify RNA-RNA interacting pairs in vivo in Bacillus subtilis, resolving previously well-described interactants. Although sRNA-sRNA pairings are rare (compared with sRNA-mRNA), we identify a robust example involving the conserved sRNA RoxS and an unstudied sRNA RosA (Regulator of sRNA A). We show RosA to be the first confirmed RNA sponge described in a Gram-positive bacterium. RosA interacts with at least two sRNAs, RoxS and FsrA. The RosA/RoxS interaction not only affects the levels of RoxS but also its processing and regulatory activity. We also found that the transcription of RosA is repressed by CcpA, the key regulator of carbon-metabolism in B. subtilis. Since RoxS is already known to be transcriptionally controlled by malate via the transcriptional repressor Rex, its post-transcriptional regulation by CcpA via RosA places RoxS in a key position to control central metabolism in response to varying carbon sources.
PXD024633	34096683	Mitochondrial mistranslation modulated by metabolic stress causes cardiovascular disease and reduced lifespan. 	Mitochondrial mistranslation modulated by metabolic stress causes cardiovascular disease and reduced life-span	Heart, Mitochondria	Changes in the rate and fidelity of mitochondrial protein synthesis impact the metabolic and physiological roles of mitochondria. Here we explored how environmental stress in the form of a high-fat diet modulates mitochondrial translation and affects lifespan in mutant mice with error-prone (Mrps12(ep)(/)(ep) ) or hyper-accurate (Mrps12(ha)(/)(ha) ) mitochondrial ribosomes. Intriguingly, although both mutations are metabolically beneficial in reducing body weight, decreasing circulating insulin and increasing glucose tolerance during a high-fat diet, they manifest divergent (either deleterious or beneficial) outcomes in a tissue-specific manner. In two distinct organs that are commonly affected by the metabolic disease, the heart and the liver, Mrps12(ep)(/)(ep) mice were protected against heart defects but sensitive towards lipid accumulation in the liver, activating genes involved in steroid and amino acid metabolism. In contrast, enhanced translational accuracy in Mrps12(ha)(/)(ha) mice protected the liver from a high-fat diet through activation of liver proliferation programs, but enhanced the development of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and led to reduced lifespan. These findings reflect the complex transcriptional and cell signalling responses that differ between post-mitotic (heart) and highly proliferative (liver) tissues. We show trade-offs between the rate and fidelity of mitochondrial protein synthesis dictate tissue-specific outcomes due to commonly encountered stressful environmental conditions or aging.
PXD022976	34097874	Mutation-induced dimerization of transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein may drive protein aggregation in granular corneal dystrophy. 	The structures of R124H and R555W TGFBIp suggest a direct role of the mutated residues in the aggregation of TGFBIp in granular corneal dystrophy	TGFBI, TGFBIp, Xâ€ray crystallography, extracellular matrix protein, granular corneal dystrophy, lattice corneal dystrophy, protein aggregation, protein crossâ€linking	Protein aggregation in the outermost layers of the cornea, which can lead to cloudy vision and in severe cases blindness, is linked to mutations in the extracellular matrix protein transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBIp). Among the most frequent pathogenic mutations are R124H and R555W, both associated with granular corneal dystrophy (GCD) characterized by the early-onset formation of amorphous aggregates. The molecular mechanisms of protein aggregation in GCD are largely unknown. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of R124H, R555W, and the lattice corneal dystrophy-associated A546T. Although there were no changes in the monomeric TGFBIp structure of any mutant that would explain their propensity to aggregate, R124H and R555W demonstrated a new dimer interface in the crystal packing, which is not present in wildtype TGFBIp or A546T. This interface, as seen in both the R124H and R555W structures, involves residue 124 of the first TGFBIp molecule and 555 in the second. The interface is not permitted by the Arg124 and Arg555 residues of wildtype TGFBIp and may play a central role in the aggregation exhibited by R124H and R555W in vivo. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry and in-line size exclusion chromatography-small-angle X-ray scattering, we characterized a dimer formed by wildtype and mutant TGFBIps in solution. Dimerization in solution also involves interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains of two TGFBIp molecules but was not identical to the crystal packing dimerization. TGFBIp-targeted interventions that disrupt the R124H/R555W crystal packing dimer interface might offer new therapeutic opportunities to treat patients with GCD.
PXD018857	34099649	Ubiquitylation of MLKL at lysine 219 positively regulates necroptosis-induced tissue injury and pathogen clearance. 	Ubiquitin-mediated modulation of necroptotic effector MLKL	Cancer, MLKL, MSMS, TMT, Ubiquitin	Necroptosis is a lytic, inflammatory form of cell death that not only contributes to pathogen clearance but can also lead to disease pathogenesis. Necroptosis is triggered by RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation of MLKL, which is thought to initiate MLKL oligomerisation, membrane translocation and membrane rupture, although the precise mechanism is incompletely understood. Here, we show that K63-linked ubiquitin chains are attached to MLKL during necroptosis and that ubiquitylation of MLKL at K219 significantly contributes to the cytotoxic potential of phosphorylated MLKL. The K219R MLKL mutation protects animals from necroptosis-induced skin damage and renders cells resistant to pathogen-induced necroptosis. Mechanistically, we show that ubiquitylation of MLKL at K219 is required for higher-order assembly of MLKL at membranes, facilitating its rupture and necroptosis. We demonstrate that K219 ubiquitylation licenses MLKL activity to induce lytic cell death, suggesting that necroptotic clearance of pathogens as well as MLKL-dependent pathologies are influenced by the ubiquitin-signalling system.
PXD024089	34099652	SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and proteomic trajectories inform prognostication in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care. 	SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and proteomic biomarker trajectory inform prognostication in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care	Biomarker, COVID-19, Covid-19, Pentraxin-3, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, RNAemia, SARS-CoV-2	Prognostic characteristics inform risk stratification in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We obtained blood samples (n = 474) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 123), non-COVID-19 ICU sepsis patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 30). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected in plasma or serum (RNAemia) of COVID-19 ICU patients when neutralizing antibody response was low. RNAemia is associated with higher 28-day ICU mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.84 [95% CI, 1.22-2.77] adjusted for age and sex). RNAemia is comparable in performance to the best protein predictors. Mannose binding lectin 2 and pentraxin-3 (PTX3), two activators of the complement pathway of the innate immune system, are positively associated with mortality. Machine learning identified 'Age, RNAemia' and 'Age, PTX3' as the best binary signatures associated with 28-day ICU mortality. In longitudinal comparisons, COVID-19 ICU patients have a distinct proteomic trajectory associated with mortality, with recovery of many liver-derived proteins indicating survival. Finally, proteins of the complement system and galectin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP) are identified as interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. LGALS3BP overexpression inhibits spike-pseudoparticle uptake and spike-induced cell-cell fusion in vitro.
PXD021301	34099661	Pathogen effector recognition-dependent association of NRG1 with EDS1 and SAG101 in TNL receptor immunity. 	Comparative analysis of PAD4 and SAG101 interactors upon activation of NLR immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana	PAD4, SAG101, TNL, helper NLR, immunity	Plants utilise intracellular nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors to detect pathogen effectors and activate local and systemic defence. NRG1 and ADR1 "helper" NLRs (RNLs) cooperate with enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1), senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101) and phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD4) lipase-like proteins to mediate signalling from TIR domain NLR receptors (TNLs). The mechanism of RNL/EDS1 family protein cooperation is not understood. Here, we present genetic and molecular evidence for exclusive EDS1/SAG101/NRG1 and EDS1/PAD4/ADR1 co-functions in TNL immunity. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we show effector recognition-dependent interaction of NRG1 with EDS1 and SAG101, but not PAD4. An EDS1-SAG101 complex interacts with NRG1, and EDS1-PAD4 with ADR1, in an immune-activated state. NRG1 requires an intact nucleotide-binding P-loop motif, and EDS1 a functional EP domain and its partner SAG101, for induced association and immunity. Thus, two distinct modules (NRG1/EDS1/SAG101 and ADR1/EDS1/PAD4) mediate TNL receptor defence signalling.
PXD025106	34099682	Multi-target mode of action of silver against Staphylococcus aureus endows it with capability to combat antibiotic resistance. 	Silver binding proteins in S. aureus	S. aureus, silver-binding protein	The rapid emergence of drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) poses a serious threat to public health globally. Silver (Ag)-based antimicrobials are promising to combat antibiotic resistant S. aureus, yet their molecular targets are largely elusive. Herein, we separate and identify 38 authentic Ag(+)-binding proteins in S. aureus at the whole-cell scale. We then capture the molecular snapshot on the dynamic action of Ag(+) against S. aureus and further validate that Ag(+) could inhibit a key target 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase through binding to catalytic His185 by X-ray crystallography. Significantly, the multi-target mode of action of Ag(+) (and nanosilver) endows its sustainable antimicrobial efficacy, leading to enhanced efficacy of conventional antibiotics and resensitization of MRSA to antibiotics. Our study resolves the long-standing question of the molecular targets of silver in S. aureus and offers insights into the sustainable bacterial susceptibility of silver, providing a potential approach for combating antimicrobial resistance.
PXD021212	34099686	Cryo-EM structure of TFIIH/Rad4-Rad23-Rad33 in damaged DNA opening in nucleotide excision repair. 	Structure of TFIIH/Rad4-Rad23-Rad33 in damaged DNA opening in Nucleotide Excision Repair	DNA damage, DNA repair, Nucleotide Excision Repair, Rad23, Rad33, Rad4, TFIIH	The versatile nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway initiates as the XPC-RAD23B-CETN2 complex first recognizes DNA lesions from the genomic DNA and recruits the general transcription factor complex, TFIIH, for subsequent lesion verification. Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of an NER initiation complex containing Rad4-Rad23-Rad33 (yeast homologue of XPC-RAD23B-CETN2) and 7-subunit coreTFIIH assembled on a carcinogen-DNA adduct lesion at 3.9-9.2 Aa resolution. A ~30-bp DNA duplex could be mapped as it straddles between Rad4 and the Ssl2 (XPB) subunit of TFIIH on the 3' and 5' side of the lesion, respectively. The simultaneous binding with Rad4 and TFIIH was permitted by an unwinding of DNA at the lesion. Translocation coupled with torque generation by Ssl2 and Rad4 would extend the DNA unwinding at the lesion and deliver the damaged strand to Rad3 (XPD) in an open form suitable for subsequent lesion scanning and verification.
PXD025147	34099688	A histone H3K4me1-specific binding protein is required for siRNA accumulation and DNA methylation at a subset of loci targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation. 	A histone H3K4me1-specific binding protein is required for siRNA accumulation and DNA methylation at a subset of loci targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation	IP-MS	In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is a well-known de novo DNA methylation pathway that involves two plant-specific RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V. In this study, we discovered and characterized an RdDM factor, RDM15. Through DNA methylome and genome-wide siRNA analyses, we show that RDM15 is required for RdDM-dependent DNA methylation and siRNA accumulation at a subset of RdDM target loci. We show that RDM15 contributes to Pol V-dependent downstream siRNA accumulation and interacts with NRPE3B, a subunit specific to Pol V. We also show that the C-terminal tudor domain of RDM15 specifically recognizes the histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) mark. Structure analysis of RDM15 in complex with the H3K4me1 peptide showed that the RDM15 tudor domain specifically recognizes the monomethyllysine through an aromatic cage and a specific hydrogen bonding network; this chemical feature-based recognition mechanism differs from all previously reported monomethyllysine recognition mechanisms. RDM15 and H3K4me1 have similar genome-wide distribution patterns at RDM15-dependent RdDM target loci, establishing a link between H3K4me1 and RDM15-mediated RdDM in vivo. In summary, we have identified and characterized a histone H3K4me1-specific binding protein as an RdDM component, and structural analysis of RDM15 revealed a chemical feature-based lower methyllysine recognition mechanism.
PXD025826	34102146	On-tissue spatially resolved glycoproteomics guided by N-glycan imaging reveal global dysregulation of canine glioma glycoproteomic landscape. 	On-tissue spatially-resolved glycoproteomics guided by N-glycan imaging reveal global dysregulation of canine glioma glycoproteomic landscape	Glycan-imaging, MALDI-MSI, glioblastoma, glycoproteomics, haptoglobin, hypersialylation, sialic-acid, spatially-resolved	Here, we present an approach to identify N-linked glycoproteins and deduce their spatial localization using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) N-glycan mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and spatially resolved glycoproteomics. We subjected glioma biopsies to on-tissue PNGaseF digestion and MALDI-MSI and found that the glycan HexNAc4-Hex5-NeuAc2 was predominantly expressed in necrotic regions of high-grade canine gliomas. To determine the underlying sialo-glycoprotein, various regions in adjacent tissue sections were subjected to microdigestion and manual glycoproteomic analysis. Results identified haptoglobin as the protein associated with HexNAc4-Hex5-NeuAc2, thus directly linking glycan imaging with intact glycopeptide identification. In total, our spatially resolved glycoproteomics technique identified over 400 N-, O-, and S- glycopeptides from over 30 proteins, demonstrating the diverse array of glycosylation present on the tissue slices and the sensitivity of our technique. Ultimately, this proof-of-principle work demonstrates that spatially resolved glycoproteomics greatly complement MALDI-MSI in understanding dysregulated glycosylation.
PXD022732	34102570	Amino acid substitutions in ribosomal protein RpsU enable switching between high fitness and multiple-stress resistance in Listeria monocytogenes. 	Amino acid substitutions in ribosomal protein RpsU enable switching between high fitness and multiple-stress resistance in Listeria monocytogenes	Experimental evolution, Food safety, Pathogen, Persistence, Sigma B	Microbial population heterogeneity contributes to differences in stress response between individual cells in a population, and can lead to the selection of genetically stable variants with increased stress resistance. We previously provided evidence that the multiple-stress resistant Listeria monocytogenes LO28 variant 15, carries a point mutation in the rpsU gene, resulting in an arginine-proline substitution in ribosomal protein RpsU (RpsU(17Arg-Pro)). Here, we investigated the trade-off between general stress sigma factor SigB-mediated stress resistance and fitness in variant 15 using experimental evolution. By selecting for higher fitness in two parallel evolving cultures, we identified two evolved variants: 15EV1 and 15EV2. Whole genome sequencing and SNP analysis showed that both parallel lines mutated in the same codon in rpsU as the original mutation resulting in RpsU(17Pro-His) (15EV1) and RpsU(17Pro-Thr) (15EV2). Using a combined phenotyping and proteomics approach, we assessed the resistance of the evolved variants to both heat and acid stress, and found that in both lines reversion to WT-like fitness also resulted in WT-like stress sensitivity. Proteome analysis of L. monocytogenes LO28 WT, variant 15, 15EV1, and 15EV2 revealed high level expression of SigB regulon members only in variant 15, whereas protein profiles of both evolved variants were highly similar to that of the LO28 WT. Experiments with constructed RpsU(17Arg-Pro) mutants in L. monocytogenes LO28 and EGDe, and RpsU(17Arg-His) and RpsU(17Arg-Thr) in LO28, confirmed that single amino acid substitutions in RpsU enable switching between multiple-stress resistant and high fitness states in L. monocytogenes.
PXD026071	34103528	PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation activates AKT kinase to govern tumorigenesis. 	PRMT5-mediated arginine methylation activates AKT kinase  to govern tumorigenesis	AKT, Arginine methylation, PRMT5, tumorigenesis	AKT is involved in a number of key cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism. Hyperactivation of AKT is associated with many pathological conditions, particularly cancers. Emerging evidence indicates that arginine methylation is involved in modulating AKT signaling pathway. However, whether and how arginine methylation directly regulates AKT kinase activity remain unknown. Here we report that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), but not other PRMTs, promotes AKT activation by catalyzing symmetric dimethylation of AKT1 at arginine 391 (R391). Mechanistically, AKT1-R391 methylation cooperates with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3) to relieve the pleckstrin homology (PH)-in conformation, leading to AKT1 membrane translocation and subsequent activation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). As a result, deficiency in AKT1-R391 methylation significantly suppresses AKT1 kinase activity and tumorigenesis. Lastly, we show that PRMT5 inhibitor synergizes with AKT inhibitor or chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance cell death. Altogether, our study suggests that R391 methylation is an important step for AKT activation and its oncogenic function.
PXD024965	34104540	Low-dose CDK4/6 inhibitors induce presentation of pathway specific MHC ligands as potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. 	Low-Dose CDK4/6 Inhibitors Induce Presentation of Pathway Specific MHC ligands as Potential Targets for Cancer Immunotherapy	Abemaciclib, Breast Cancer, CDK4/6 Inhibition, MHC Ligand, Palbociclib	Cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) lead to cell-cycle arrest but also trigger T cell-mediated immunity, which might be mediated by changes in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands. We investigated the effects of CDK4/6i, abemaciclib and palbociclib, on the immunopeptidome at nontoxic levels in breast cancer cell lines by biochemical identification of HLA ligands followed by network analyses. This treatment led to upregulation of HLA and revealed hundreds of induced HLA ligands in breast cancer cell lines. These new ligands were significantly enriched for peptides derived from proteins involved in the "G1/S phase transition of cell cycle" including HLA ligands from CDK4/6, Cyclin D1 and the 26S regulatory proteasomal subunit 4 (PSMC1). Interestingly, peptides from proteins targeted by abemaciclib and palbociclib, were predicted to be the most likely to induce a T cell response. In strong contrast, peptides induced by solely one of the drugs had a lower T cell recognition score compared to the DMSO control suggesting that the observed effect is class dependent. This general hypothesis was exemplified by a peptide from PSMC1 which was among the HLA ligands with highest prediction scores and which elicited a T cell response in healthy donors. Overall, these data demonstrate that CDK4/6i treatment gives rise to drug-induced HLA ligands from G1/S phase transition, that have the highest chance for being recognized by T cells, thus providing evidence that inhibition of a distinct cellular process leads to increased presentation of the involved proteins that may be targeted by immunotherapeutic agents.
PXD022670	34105576	beta-Adrenoceptor regulation of metabolism in U937 derived macrophages. 	beta-Adrenergic regulation of metabolism in macrophages	macrophage	Macrophages have important roles in the immune system including clearing pathogens and wound healing. Metabolic phenotypes in macrophages have been associated with functional phenotypes, where pro-inflammatory macrophages have an increased rate of glycolysis and anti-inflammatory macrophages primarily use oxidative phosphorylation. beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) signalling in macrophages has been implicated in disease states such as cancer, atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The impact of betaAR signalling on macrophage metabolism has not been defined. Using metabolomics and proteomics, we describe the impact of betaAR signalling on macrophages treated with isoprenaline. We found that betaAR signalling alters proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and redox homeostasis of the cell. We showed that betaAR signalling in macrophages shifts glucose metabolism from glycolysis towards the tricarboxylic acid cycle and pentose phosphate pathways. We also show that betaAR signalling perturbs purine metabolism by accumulating adenylate and guanylate pools. Taken together, these results indicate that betaAR signalling shifts metabolism to support redox processes and upregulates proteins involved in cytoskeletal changes, which may contribute to betaAR effects on macrophage function.
PXD025617	34107032	RNA pull-down confocal nanoscanning (RP-CONA) detects quercetin as pri-miR-7/HuR interaction inhibitor that decreases alpha-synuclein levels. 	RNA pull-down-Confocal Nanoscanning (RP-CONA) detects quercetin as pri-miR-7/HuR interaction inhibitor that decreases a-Synuclein levels	HuR, Parkinson's disease, RP-CONA, miR-7, alpha-Synuclein	RNA-protein interactions are central to all gene expression processes and contribute to a variety of human diseases. Therapeutic approaches targeting RNA-protein interactions have shown promising effects on some diseases that are previously regarded as 'incurable'. Here, we developed a fluorescent on-bead screening platform, RNA Pull-Down COnfocal NAnoscanning (RP-CONA), to identify RNA-protein interaction modulators in eukaryotic cell extracts. Using RP-CONA, we identified small molecules that disrupt the interaction between HuR, an inhibitor of brain-enriched miR-7 biogenesis, and the conserved terminal loop of pri-miR-7-1. Importantly, miR-7's primary target is an mRNA of alpha-synuclein, which contributes to the aetiology of Parkinson's disease. Our method identified a natural product quercetin as a molecule able to upregulate cellular miR-7 levels and downregulate the expression of alpha-synuclein. This opens up new therapeutic avenues towards treatment of Parkinson's disease as well as provides a novel methodology to search for modulators of RNA-protein interaction.
PXD024665	34107244	Integrin intra-heterodimer affinity inversely correlates with integrin activatability. 	Integrin a5, aV, and aVb3 in zebrafish embryos at the 12 somite stage	12 somite stage, Integrin, extracellular matrix, zebrafish	Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors composed of an alpha and beta subunit that mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin. We previously studied integrin alpha5beta1 activation during zebrafish somitogenesis, and in the present study, we characterize the integrin alphaV fibronectin receptors. Integrins are activated via a conformational change, and we perform single-molecule biophysical measurements of both integrin activation via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and integrin intra-heterodimer stability via fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) in living embryos. We find that integrin heterodimers that exhibit robust cell surface expression, including alphaVbeta3, alphaVbeta5, and alphaVbeta6, are never activated in this in vivo context, even in the presence of fibronectin matrix. In contrast, activatable integrins, such as integrin alphaVbeta1, and alleles of alphaVbeta3, alphaVbeta5, alphaVbeta6 that are biased to the active conformation exhibit poor cell surface expression and have a higher intra-heterodimer dissociation constant (KD). These observations suggest that a weak integrin intra-heterodimer affinity decreases integrin cell surface stability and increases integrin activatability.
PXD021441	34107438	Proteomic analyses of plasma-derived exosomes in immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease and their potential roles in B cell differentiation and tissue damage. 	Proteomic analyses of plasma-derived exosomes in IgG4-RD and its potential role in B cell differentiation and tissue damage	B cell, IgG4-RD, exosomes	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the proteomic profiles of plasma exosomes isolated from patients with immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) and to determine their potential roles in B cell differentiation and tissue damage. METHODS: One hundred untreated IgG4-RD patients and 135 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. A combination of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and tandem mass tag (TMT)-label quantitation was used for proteomic profiling. Differentially expressed proteins were validated by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses. B cell activation, apoptosis, differentiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were analyzed by flow cytometry. We also analyzed the correlations between differentially expressed complement proteins and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: A total of 178 differentially expressed proteins were identified in plasma exosomes in IgG4-RD patients compared with HCs, and these proteins were enriched predominantly in the complement cascade pathway. Furthermore, reduced expression levels of complement components C3 and C5 in IgG4-RD were correlated with clinical parameters. Following stimulation with IgG4-RD plasma exosomes, the percentages of naive B cells decreased, while those of memory B cells and plasmablasts increased; the levels of cytochrome c, somatic (CYCS) and downstream complement system activation also increased. Moreover, ROS production was greater in B cells of IgG4-RD patients than in those of HCs. In affected submandibular glands, the BCR signalling pathway was activated, and exosomes were enriched. CONCLUSION: Proteomic profiling revealed that plasma exosome proteins may participate in the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD through complement activation and may be involved in B cell differentiation and activation of the B cell auto-oxidative damage pathway.
PXD020686	34108453	Site-specific ubiquitylation acts as a regulator of linker histone H1. 	The functional interactome of site-specifically ubiquitylated linker histone H1	chromatin, epigenetics, histone code, linker histone H1, posttranslational modification (PTM), ubiquitin	Decoding the role of histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) is key to understand the fundamental process of epigenetic regulation. This is well studied for PTMs of core histones but not for linker histone H1 in general and its ubiquitylation in particular due to a lack of proper tools. Here, we report on the chemical synthesis of site-specifically mono-ubiquitylated H1.2 and identify its ubiquitin-dependent interactome on a proteome-wide scale. We show that site-specific ubiquitylation of H1 at position K64 modulates interactions with deubiquitylating enzymes and the deacetylase SIRT1. Moreover, it affects H1-dependent chromatosome assembly and phase separation resulting in a more open chromatosome conformation generally associated with a transcriptionally active chromatin state. In summary, we propose that site-specific ubiquitylation plays a general regulatory role for linker histone H1.
PXD020293	34108460	Translation and codon usage regulate Argonaute slicer activity to trigger small RNA biogenesis. 	Translation and codon usage regulate Argonaute slicer activity to trigger small RNA biogenesis	Argonaute, C. elegans, CSR-1, small RNA	In the Caenorhabditis elegans germline, thousands of mRNAs are concomitantly expressed with antisense 22G-RNAs, which are loaded into the Argonaute CSR-1. Despite their essential functions for animal fertility and embryonic development, how CSR-1 22G-RNAs are produced remains unknown. Here, we show that CSR-1 slicer activity is primarily involved in triggering the synthesis of small RNAs on the coding sequences of germline mRNAs and post-transcriptionally regulates a fraction of targets. CSR-1-cleaved mRNAs prime the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, EGO-1, to synthesize 22G-RNAs in phase with translating ribosomes, in contrast to other 22G-RNAs mostly synthesized in germ granules. Moreover, codon optimality and efficient translation antagonize CSR-1 slicing and 22G-RNAs biogenesis. We propose that codon usage differences encoded into mRNA sequences might be a conserved strategy in eukaryotes to regulate small RNA biogenesis and Argonaute targeting.
PXD021007	34108468	Structural insight on assembly-line catalysis in terpene biosynthesis. 	Phomopsis amygdala fusicoccadiene synthase	GGPP synthase, terpene cyclase	Fusicoccadiene synthase from Phomopsis amygdali (PaFS) is a unique bifunctional terpenoid synthase that catalyzes the first two steps in the biosynthesis of the diterpene glycoside Fusicoccin A, a mediator of 14-3-3 protein interactions. The prenyltransferase domain of PaFS generates geranylgeranyl diphosphate, which the cyclase domain then utilizes to generate fusicoccadiene, the tricyclic hydrocarbon skeleton of Fusicoccin A. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to show that the structure of full-length PaFS consists of a central octameric core of prenyltransferase domains, with the eight cyclase domains radiating outward via flexible linker segments in variable splayed-out positions. Cryo-electron microscopy and chemical crosslinking experiments additionally show that compact conformations can be achieved in which cyclase domains are more closely associated with the prenyltransferase core. This structural analysis provides a framework for understanding substrate channeling, since most of the geranylgeranyl diphosphate generated by the prenyltransferase domains remains on the enzyme for cyclization to form fusicoccadiene.

Global Profiling of RNA-Binding Protein Target Sites by LACE-seq	Ago2, LACE-seq, endo-siRNA	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have essential functions during germline and early embryo development. However, current methods are unable to identify the in vivo targets of a RBP in these low-abundance cells. Here, by coupling RBP-mediated reverse transcription termination with linear amplification of complementary DNA ends and sequencing, we present the LACE-seq method for identifying RBP-regulated RNA networks at or near the single-oocyte level. We determined the binding sites and regulatory mechanisms for several RBPs, including Argonaute 2 (Ago2), Mili, Ddx4 and Ptbp1, in mature mouse oocytes. Unexpectedly, transcriptomics and proteomics analysis of Ago2(-/-) oocytes revealed that Ago2 interacts with endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) to repress mRNA translation globally. Furthermore, the Ago2 and endo-siRNA complexes fine-tune the transcriptome by slicing long terminal repeat retrotransposon-derived chimeric transcripts. The precise mapping of RBP-binding sites in low-input cells opens the door to studying the roles of RBPs in embryonic development and reproductive diseases.
PXD029196	34109043	A biocodicological analysis of the medieval library and archive from Orval Abbey, Belgium. 	Data from "A biocodicological analysis of the medieval library and archive from Orval Abbey, Belgium.	Orval, charters, codices	Biocodicological analysis of parchments from manuscript books and archives offers unprecedented insight into the materiality of medieval literacy. Using ZooMS for animal species identification, we explored almost the entire library and all the preserved single leaf charters of a single medieval Cistercian monastery (Orval Abbey, Belgium). Systematic non-invasive sampling of parchment collagen was performed on every charter and on the first bifolium from every quire of the 118 codicological units composing the books (1490 samples in total). Within the genuine production of the Orval scriptorium (26 units), a balanced use of calfskin (47.1%) and sheepskin (48.5%) was observed, whereas calfskin was less frequent (24.3%) in externally produced units acquired by the monastery (92 units). Calfskin was preferably used for higher quality manuscripts while sheepskin tends to be the standard choice for 'ordinary' manuscript book production. This finding is consistent with thirteenth-century parchment accounts from Beaulieu Abbey (England) where calfskin supply was more limited and its price higher. Our study reveals that the making of archival documents does not follow the same pattern as the production of library books. Although the five earliest preserved charters are made of calfskin, from the 1230s onwards, all charters from Orval are written on sheepskin.
PXD024790	34109180	Priming With Toll-Like Receptor 3 Agonist Poly(I:C) Enhances Content of Innate Immune Defense Proteins but Not MicroRNAs in Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles. 	LC-MSMS of Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells after Priming	Extracellular Vesicles, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Orbitrap Eclipse, Poly(I:C), Priming, hydrogen peroxide	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) help fight infection by promoting direct bacterial killing or indirectly by modulating the acute phase response, thereby decreasing tissue injury. Recent evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from MSCs retain antimicrobial characteristics that may be enhanced by pretreatment of parent MSCs with the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist poly(I:C). Our aim was to determine whether poly(I:C) priming can modify EV content of miRNAs and/or proteins to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of their enhanced antimicrobial function. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured with or without 1 mug/ml poly(I:C) for 1 h and then conditioned media was collected after 64 h of culture in EV-depleted media. Mass spectrometry and small RNA next-generation sequencing were performed to compare proteomic and miRNA profiles. Poly(I:C) priming resulted in 49 upregulated EV proteins, with 21 known to be important in host defense and innate immunity. In contrast, EV miRNA content was not significantly altered. Functional annotation clustering analysis revealed enrichment in biological processes and pathways including negative regulation of endopeptidase activity, acute phase, complement and coagulation cascades, innate immunity, immune response, and Staphylococcus aureus infection. Several antimicrobial peptides identified in EVs remained unaltered by poly(I:C) priming, including dermcidin, lactoferrin, lipocalin 1, lysozyme C, neutrophil defensin 1, S100A7 (psoriasin), S100A8/A9 (calprotectin), and histone H4. Although TLR3 activation of MSCs improves the proteomic profile of EVs, further investigation is needed to determine the relative importance of particular functional EV proteins and their activated signaling pathways following EV interaction with immune cells.
PXD024835	34110173	An Integrated Strategy Reveals Complex Glycosylation of Erythropoietin Using Mass Spectrometry. 	An integrated strategy reveals complex glycosylation of erythropoi-etin using top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry	Bottom-up, Erythropoietin, Glycosylation, Python scripts, Top-down	The characterization of therapeutic glycoproteins is challenging due to the structural heterogeneity of the therapeutic protein glycosylation. This study presents an in-depth analytical strategy for glycosylation of first-generation erythropoietin (epoetin beta), including a developed mass spectrometric workflow for N-glycan analysis, bottom-up mass spectrometric methods for site-specific N-glycosylation, and a LC-MS approach for O-glycan identification. Permethylated N-glycans, peptides, and enriched glycopeptides of erythropoietin were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS, and de-N-glycosylated erythropoietin was measured by LC-MS, enabling the qualitative and quantitative analysis of glycosylation and different glycan modifications (e.g., phosphorylation and O-acetylation). The newly developed Python scripts enabled the identification of 140 N-glycan compositions (237 N-glycan structures) from erythropoietin, especially including 8 phosphorylated N-glycan species. The site-specificity of N-glycans was revealed at the glycopeptide level by pGlyco software using different proteases. In total, 114 N-glycan compositions were identified from glycopeptide analysis. Moreover, LC-MS analysis of de-N-glycosylated erythropoietin species identified two O-glycan compositions based on the mass shifts between non-O-glycosylated and O-glycosylated species. Finally, this integrated strategy was proved to realize the in-depth glycosylation analysis of a therapeutic glycoprotein to understand its pharmacological properties and improving the manufacturing processes.
PXD019733	34110797	A Universal and High-Throughput Proteomics Sample Preparation Platform. 	A Universal 384-Well Proteomic Sample Preparation Platform for  High-Throughput Screening and Biomarker Discovery	HPLC-MS, MRM, biomarkers, high-throughput screening	Major advances have been made to improve the sensitivity of mass analyzers, spectral quality, and speed of data processing enabling more comprehensive proteome discovery and quantitation. While focus has recently begun shifting toward robust proteomics sample preparation efforts, a high-throughput proteomics sample preparation is still lacking. We report the development of a highly automated universal 384-well plate sample preparation platform with high reproducibility and adaptability for extraction of proteins from cells within a culture plate. Digestion efficiency was excellent in comparison to a commercial digest peptide standard with minimal sample loss while improving sample preparation throughput by 20- to 40-fold (the entire process from plated cells to clean peptides is complete in ~300 min). Analysis of six human cell types, including two primary cell samples, identified and quantified ~4,000 proteins for each sample in a single high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry injection with only 100-10K cells, thus demonstrating universality of the platform. The selected protein was further quantified using a developed HPLC-multiple reaction monitoring method for HeLa digests with two heavy labeled internal standard peptides spiked in. Excellent linearity was achieved across different cell numbers indicating a potential for target protein quantitation in clinical research.
PXD024447	34111213	From birth to adulthood: An analysis of the Brazilian lancehead (Bothrops moojeni) venom at different life stages. 	From birth to adulthood: An analysis of Bothrops moojeni snake venom at different life stages	Bothrops moojeni, HDMSE, ontogeny, snake venom	The Brazilian lancehead (Bothrops moojeni) has a wide distribution in Brazil and represents a serious public health hazard. Previous works reported that the symptoms of snakebites caused by B. moojeni juveniles' bites were mainly related to coagulation, while those caused by adults' bites had a more prominent local damage. In this work, we analyzed the venoms of B. moojeni at different life stages to better understand the ontogeny shift in this species. Snakes were grouped by age and sex, and venom pools were formed accordingly. Compositional analyses by one-dimensional electrophoresis (1-DE), chromatography, and mass spectrometry revealed that ontogenetic changes might be mostly related to phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and metalloproteases. Regarding the venoms functional aspect, proteolytic, L-amino acid oxidase, PLA2, and coagulant in vitro activities were assayed, but only the first and the last ones showed age-related changes, with the venom of snakes up to 1 year-old displaying lower proteolytic and higher coagulant activities, while those from 2 years-old onward presented the opposite relation. The venoms of 3 years-old snakes were exceptions to the compositional and functional pattern of adults as both venoms presented profiles similar to neonates. Sex-related differences were observed in specific groups and were not age-related. In vivo experiments (median lethal dose and hemorrhagic activity) were statistically similar between neonates and adults, however we verified that the adult venom killed mice faster comparing to the neonates. All venoms were mostly recognized by the antibothropic serum and displayed similar profiles to 1-DE in western blotting. In conclusion, the Brazilian lancehead venom showed ontogenetic shift in its composition and activities. Furthermore, this change occurred in snakes from 1 to 2 years-old, and interestingly the venom pools from 3 years-old snakes had particular characteristics, which highlights the importance of comprehensive studies to better understand venom variability.
PXD019359	34111399	Translation stress and collided ribosomes are co-activators of cGAS. 	cGAS Senses Translation Stress Through Direct Binding to Ribosomes	ASCC, cGAS, ribosomes	The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway senses cytosolic DNA and induces interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to activate the innate immune system. Here, we report the unexpected discovery that cGAS also senses dysfunctional protein production. Purified ribosomes interact directly with cGAS and stimulate its DNA-dependent activity in vitro. Disruption of the ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) pathway, which detects and resolves ribosome collision during translation, results in cGAS-dependent ISG expression and causes re-localization of cGAS from the nucleus to the cytosol. Indeed, cGAS preferentially binds collided ribosomes in vitro, and orthogonal perturbations that result in elevated levels of collided ribosomes and RQC activation cause sub-cellular re-localization of cGAS and ribosome binding in vivo as well. Thus, translation stress potently increases DNA-dependent cGAS activation. These findings have implications for the inflammatory response to viral infection and tumorigenesis, both of which substantially reprogram cellular protein synthesis.
PXD022799	34111560	lncRNA lnc-POP1-1 upregulated by VN1R5 promotes cisplatin resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma through interaction with MCM5. 	Long noncoding RNA lnc-POP1-1 upregulated by VN1R5 promotes cisplatin resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma through interaction with MCM5	Cisplatin resistance, DNA repair, Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Long noncoding RNA, MCM5, VN1R5, lnc-POP1-1	Cisplatin resistance is a major therapeutic challenge in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here, we aimed to investigate the key signaling pathway for cisplatin resistance in HNSCC cells. Vomeronasal type-1 receptor 5 (VN1R5) was identified as a cisplatin resistance-related protein and was highly expressed in cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cells and tissues. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) lnc-POP1-1 was confirmed to be a downstream target induced by VN1R5. VN1R5 transcriptionally regulated lnc-POP1-1 expression by activating the specificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor via the cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. VN1R5 promoted cisplatin resistance in HNSCC cells in a lnc-POP1-1-dependent manner. Mechanistically, lnc-POP1-1 bound to the minichromosome maintenance deficient 5 (MCM5) protein directly and decelerated MCM5 degradation by inhibiting ubiquitination of the MCM5 protein, which facilitated the repair of DNA damage caused by cisplatin. In summary, we identified the cisplatin resistance-related protein VN1R5 and its downstream target lnc-POP1-1. Upon upregulation by VN1R5, lnc-POP1-1 promotes DNA repair in HNSCC cells through interaction with MCM5 and deceleration of its degradation.
PXD024278	34113672	Tandem Mass Tag-Based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Chicken Bursa of Fabricius Infected With Reticuloendotheliosis Virus. 	Tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics analysis of chicken bursa of Fabricius infected with reticuloendotheliosis virus	Reticuloendotheliosis virus, bursa of Fabricius, differentially expressed proteins, quantitative proteomics	Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is a type C avian retrovirus that causes immunosuppression, dwarf syndrome, and lymphoma in infected hosts. In this study, we used tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to characterize protein alterations in chicken bursa of Fabricius, before and after REV infection at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Our data showed that 1,127, 999, 910, and 1,138 differentially expressed proteins were significantly altered at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after REV infection, respectively. Morphological analysis showed that REV infection reduced in cortical lymphocytes, bursal follicle atrophy, and nuclear damage. Bioinformatics analysis indicated these proteins were mainly involved with immune responses, energy metabolism, cellular processes, biological regulation, metabolic processes, response to stimuli, and multicellular organismal process. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway cluster analysis showed that post-infection, proteins were enriched in the cell cycle, Wnt signaling, antigen processing and presentation, cytokine receptor interaction, adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate signaling pathway, and NF-kappaB signaling. In addition, we observed that peroxiredoxin 4 (PRDX4), peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), catalase (CAT), and peroxidasin (PXDN) were involved in oxidative stress. Some heat shock protein (HSP) family members such as HSPH1, DNAJA4, HSPA8, and HSPA4L also changed significantly after REV infection. These findings help clarify interactions between REV and the host and provides mechanistic insights on REV-induced host immunosuppression.
PXD018365	34113809	The USP7-TRIM27 axis mediates non-canonical PRC1.1 function and is a druggable target in leukemia. 	The USP7-TRIM27 axis as part of non-canonical PRC1.1 is a druggable target in leukemia	Leukemia, PRC1.1, Polycomb, TRIM27, USP7	In an attempt to unravel functionality of the non-canonical PRC1.1 Polycomb complex in human leukemogenesis, we show that USP7 and TRIM27 are integral components of PRC1.1. USP7 interactome analyses show that PRC1.1 is the predominant Polycomb complex co-precipitating with USP7. USP7 inhibition results in PRC1.1 disassembly and loss of chromatin binding, coinciding with reduced H2AK119ub and H3K27ac levels and diminished gene transcription of active PRC1.1-controlled loci, whereas H2AK119ub marks are also lost at PRC1 loci. TRIM27 and USP7 are reciprocally required for incorporation into PRC1.1, and TRIM27 knockdown partially rescues USP7 inhibitor sensitivity. USP7 inhibitors effectively impair proliferation in AML cells in vitro, also independent of the USP7-MDM2-TP53 axis, and MLL-AF9-induced leukemia is delayed in vivo in human leukemia xenografts. We propose a model where USP7 counteracts TRIM27 E3 ligase activity, thereby maintaining PRC1.1 integrity and function. Moreover, USP7 inhibition may be a promising new strategy to treat AML patients.
PXD023338	34114741	Blocking utilization of major plant biomass polysaccharides leads Aspergillus niger towards utilization of minor components. 	Blocking utilization of major plant biomass polysaccharides leads Aspergillus niger towards utilization of minor components.	Aspergillus niger, LC-MSMS., combinatorial deletions, plant biomass, regulation, transcription factors	Fungi produce a wide range of enzymes that allow them to grow on diverse plant biomass. Wheat bran is a low-cost substrate with high potential for biotechnological applications. It mainly contains cellulose and (arabino)xylan, as well as starch, proteins, lipids and lignin to a lesser extent. In this study, we dissected the regulatory network governing wheat bran degradation in Aspergillus niger to assess the relative contribution of the regulators to the utilization of this plant biomass substrate. Deletion of genes encoding transcription factors involved in (hemi-)cellulose utilization (XlnR, AraR, ClrA and ClrB) individually and in combination significantly reduced production of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, but retained substantial growth on wheat bran. Proteomic analysis suggested the ability of A. niger to grow on other carbon components, such as starch, which was confirmed by the additional deletion of the amylolytic regulator AmyR. Growth was further reduced but not impaired, indicating that other minor components provide sufficient energy for residual growth, displaying the flexibility of A. niger, and likely other fungi, in carbon utilization. Better understanding of the complexity and flexibility of fungal regulatory networks will facilitate the generation of more efficient fungal cell factories that use plant biomass as a substrate.
PXD015923	34115982	Cytomegalovirus subverts macrophage identity. 	Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of CMV-infected macrophages	cytomegalovirus, macrophage, phosphoproteome	Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts for millions of years, leading to remarkable host specificity and high infection prevalence. Macrophages, which already populate barrier tissues in the embryo, are the predominant immune cells at potential CMV entry sites. Here we show that, upon CMV infection, macrophages undergo a morphological, immunophenotypic, and metabolic transformation process with features of stemness, altered migration, enhanced invasiveness, and provision of the cell cycle machinery for viral proliferation. This complex process depends on Wnt signaling and the transcription factor ZEB1. In pulmonary infection, mouse CMV primarily targets and reprograms alveolar macrophages, which alters lung physiology and facilitates primary CMV and secondary bacterial infection by attenuating the inflammatory response. Thus, CMV profoundly perturbs macrophage identity beyond established limits of plasticity and rewires specific differentiation processes, allowing viral spread and impairing innate tissue immunity.
PXD024148	34117231	Reliable identification of protein-protein interactions by crosslinking mass spectrometry. 	Reliable identification of protein-protein interactions by crosslinking mass spectrometry_CLMS_sSDA_datasets	AP-MS, E. coli, FDR, crosslinking, protein-protein interaction	Protein-protein interactions govern most cellular pathways and processes, and multiple technologies have emerged to systematically map them. Assessing the error of interaction networks has been a challenge. Crosslinking mass spectrometry is currently widening its scope from structural analyses of purified multi-protein complexes towards systems-wide analyses of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Using a carefully controlled large-scale analysis of Escherichia coli cell lysate, we demonstrate that false-discovery rates (FDR) for PPIs identified by crosslinking mass spectrometry can be reliably estimated. We present an interaction network comprising 590 PPIs at 1% decoy-based PPI-FDR. The structural information included in this network localises the binding site of the hitherto uncharacterised protein YacL to near the DNA exit tunnel on the RNA polymerase.
PXD024800	34117251	Comprehensive micro-scaled proteome and phosphoproteome characterization of archived retrospective cancer repositories. 	Comprehensive micro-scaled proteome and phosphoproteome characterization of archived retrospective cancer repositories	FFPE, NSCLC	Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are a valuable resource for retrospective clinical studies. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of (phospho-)proteomics on FFPE lung tissue regarding protein extraction, quantification, pre-analytics, and sample size. After comparing protein extraction protocols, we use the best-performing protocol for the acquisition of deep (phospho-)proteomes from lung squamous cell and adenocarcinoma with >8,000 quantified proteins and >14,000 phosphosites with a tandem mass tag (TMT) approach. With a microscaled approach, we quantify 7,000 phosphosites, enabling the analysis of FFPE biopsies with limited tissue amounts. We also investigate the influence of pre-analytical variables including fixation time and heat-assisted de-crosslinking on protein extraction efficiency and proteome coverage. Our improved workflows provide quantitative information on protein abundance and phosphosite regulation for the most relevant oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and signaling pathways in lung cancer. Finally, we present general guidelines to which methods are best suited for different applications, highlighting TMT methods for comprehensive (phospho-)proteome profiling for focused clinical studies and label-free methods for large cohorts.

Characterization of hyperglycemia due to sub-chronic administration of red ginseng extract via comparative global proteomic analysis	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Human Proteome Project, Korean red ginseng, ProteomeXchange project tag: Toxicoproteomics (B/D-HPP), cystathionin beta-synthase, cystathionine gamma- lyase, hydrogen s	Ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) is commonly used as an herbal remedy worldwide. Few studies have explored the possible physiological changes in the liver although patients often self-medicate with ginseng preparations, which may lead to exceeding the recommended dose for long-term administration. Here, we analyzed changes in the hepatic proteins of mouse livers using quantitative proteomics after sub-chronic administration of Korean red ginseng (KRG) extract (control group and 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg KRG) using tandem mass tag (TMT) 6-plex technology. The 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg KRG groups exhibited signs of liver injury, including increased levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the serum. Furthermore, serum glucose levels were significantly higher following KRG administration compared with the control group. Based on the upregulated proteins found in the proteomic analysis, we found that increased cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) levels promoted greater hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesis in the liver. This investigation provides novel evidence that sub-chronic administration of KRG can elevate H2S production by increasing protein expression of CBS and CSE in the liver.
PXD022011	34117303	Assessment of a complete and classified platelet proteome from genome-wide transcripts of human platelets and megakaryocytes covering platelet functions. 	Functional class assignment of the complete platelet proteome and transcriptome	Human platelets, transcriptomics	Novel platelet and megakaryocyte transcriptome analysis allows prediction of the full or theoretical proteome of a representative human platelet. Here, we integrated the established platelet proteomes from six cohorts of healthy subjects, encompassing 5.2 k proteins, with two novel genome-wide transcriptomes (57.8 k mRNAs). For 14.8 k protein-coding transcripts, we assigned the proteins to 21 UniProt-based classes, based on their preferential intracellular localization and presumed function. This classified transcriptome-proteome profile of platelets revealed: (i) Absence of 37.2 k genome-wide transcripts. (ii) High quantitative similarity of platelet and megakaryocyte transcriptomes (R = 0.75) for 14.8 k protein-coding genes, but not for 3.8 k RNA genes or 1.9 k pseudogenes (R = 0.43-0.54), suggesting redistribution of mRNAs upon platelet shedding from megakaryocytes. (iii) Copy numbers of 3.5 k proteins that were restricted in size by the corresponding transcript levels (iv) Near complete coverage of identified proteins in the relevant transcriptome (log2fpkm > 0.20) except for plasma-derived secretory proteins, pointing to adhesion and uptake of such proteins. (v) Underrepresentation in the identified proteome of nuclear-related, membrane and signaling proteins, as well proteins with low-level transcripts. We then constructed a prediction model, based on protein function, transcript level and (peri)nuclear localization, and calculated the achievable proteome at ~ 10 k proteins. Model validation identified 1.0 k additional proteins in the predicted classes. Network and database analysis revealed the presence of 2.4 k proteins with a possible role in thrombosis and hemostasis, and 138 proteins linked to platelet-related disorders. This genome-wide platelet transcriptome and (non)identified proteome database thus provides a scaffold for discovering the roles of unknown platelet proteins in health and disease.
PXD023646	34117322	Novel clades of soil biphenyl degraders revealed by integrating isotope probing, multi-omics, and single-cell analyses. 	Proteomics of biphenyl labelling study	13C-labelled peptides, soil	Most microorganisms in the biosphere remain uncultured and poorly characterized. Although the surge in genome sequences has enabled insights into the genetic and metabolic properties of uncultured microorganisms, their physiology and ecological roles cannot be determined without direct probing of their activities in natural habitats. Here we employed an experimental framework coupling genome reconstruction and activity assays to characterize the largely uncultured microorganisms responsible for aerobic biodegradation of biphenyl as a proxy for a large class of environmental pollutants, polychlorinated biphenyls. We used (13)C-labeled biphenyl in contaminated soils and traced the flow of pollutant-derived carbon into active cells using single-cell analyses and protein-stable isotope probing. The detection of (13)C-enriched proteins linked biphenyl biodegradation to the uncultured Alphaproteobacteria clade UBA11222, which we found to host a distinctive biphenyl dioxygenase gene widely retrieved from contaminated environments. The same approach indicated the capacity of Azoarcus species to oxidize biphenyl and suggested similar metabolic abilities for species of Rugosibacter. Biphenyl oxidation would thus represent formerly unrecognized ecological functions of both genera. The quantitative role of these microorganisms in pollutant degradation was resolved using single-cell-based uptake measurements. Our strategy advances our understanding of microbially mediated biodegradation processes and has general application potential for elucidating the ecological roles of uncultured microorganisms in their natural habitats.
PXD023418	34118193	Global analysis of protein-RNA interactions in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells reveals key regulators of infection. 	Global analysis of protein-RNA interactions in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells reveals key regulators of infection	Calu-3, EPIC-XS, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, WCP, cRIC, vRIC	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 relies on cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to replicate and spread, although which RBPs control its life cycle remains largely unknown. Here, we employ a multi-omic approach to identify systematically and comprehensively the cellular and viral RBPs that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection profoundly remodels the cellular RNA-bound proteome, which includes wide-ranging effects on RNA metabolic pathways, non-canonical RBPs, and antiviral factors. Moreover, we apply a new method to identify the proteins that directly interact with viral RNA, uncovering dozens of cellular RBPs and six viral proteins. Among them are several components of the tRNA ligase complex, which we show regulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we discover that available drugs targeting host RBPs that interact with SARS-CoV-2 RNA inhibit infection. Collectively, our results uncover a new universe of host-virus interactions with potential for new antiviral therapies against COVID-19.
PXD025248	34118970	Selective delignification of poplar wood with a newly isolated white-rot basidiomycete Peniophora incarnata T-7 by submerged fermentation to enhance saccharification. 	Peniophora incarnata T-7 LC-MSMS	Peniophora incarnata T-7, submerged fermentation	BACKGROUND: Pretreatment is a critical step required for efficient conversion of woody biomass into biofuels and platform chemicals. Fungal pretreatment is regarded as one of the most promising technology for woody biomass conversion but remains challenging for industrial application. The exploration of potential fungus strain with high efficient delignification and less processing time for woody biomass pretreatment will be valuable for development of biorefinery industry. Here, a newly isolated white-rot basidiomycete Peniophora incarnate T-7 was employed for poplar wood pretreatment. RESULTS: The chemical component analysis showed that cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin from poplar wood declined by 16%, 48% and 70%, respectively, after 7 days submerged fermentation by P. incarnate T-7. Enzymatic saccharification analysis revealed that the maximum yields of glucose and xylose from 7 days of P. incarnate T-7 treated poplar wood reached 33.4% and 27.6%, respectively, both of which were enhanced by sevenfold relative to the untreated group. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) characterization confirmed that lignocellulosic structure of poplar wood was largely broken by P. incarnate T-7, including delignification and de-crystalline of cellulose. Meanwhile, lignin component of poplar wood was selectively degraded by P. incarnate T-7, and G-type unit of lignin was preferentially attacked by the strain. Furthermore, quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that a considerable amount of lignocellulolytic enzymes were detected in the secretory proteins of P. incarnate T-7, especially with high abundance of lignin-degrading enzymes and hemicellulases. Combination of quantitative proteomic with transcriptomic analysis results showed that most of those lignocellulolytic enzymes were highly upregulated on poplar wood substrate compared to glucose substrate. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that P. incarnate T-7 could selectively delignify poplar wood by submerged fermentation with short time of 7 days, which greatly improved its enzymatic saccharification efficiency. Our results suggested that P. incarnate T-7 might be a promising candidate for industrial woody biomass pretreatment.
PXD025862	34119521	Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ppr10 and Mpa1 together mediate mitochondrial translational initiation. 	Ppr10 and Mpa1 copurify with a subset of mitoribosomal proteins	Mpa1, Ppr10, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, mitochondrial ribosome	Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are a large family of proteins that act primarily at different posttranscriptional steps of organellar gene expression. We have previously found that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe PPR protein mpal10 interacts with mitochondrial translational activator Mpa1, and both are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. However, it is unclear how these two proteins function in mitochondrial protein synthesis in S. pombe. In this study, we further investigated the role of Ppr10 and Mpa1 in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Mitochondrial translational initiation requires two initiation factors, Mti2 and Mti3, which bind to the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (mt-SSU) during the formation of the mitochondrial translational initiation complex. Using sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, we found that disruption of ppr10, mpa1, or the PPR motifs in Ppr10 impairs the association of Mti2 and Mti3 with the mt-SSU, suggesting that both Ppr10 and Mpa1 may be required for the interaction of Mti2 and Mti3 with the mt-SSU during the assembly of mitochondrial translational initiation complex. Loss of Ppr10 perturbs the association of mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b (cob1) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) mRNAs with assembled mitochondrial ribosomes. Proteomic analysis revealed that a fraction of Ppr10 and Mpa1 copurified with a subset of mitoribosomal proteins. The PPR motifs of Ppr10 are necessary for its interaction with Mpa1 and that disruption of these PPR motifs impairs mitochondrial protein synthesis. Our results suggest that Ppr10 and Mpa1 function together to mediate mitochondrial translational initiation.

It involves the formation of autophagosomes initiated by the serine/threonine kinase ULK and class III PI3 kinase VPS34 complexes. Here, unbiased phosphoproteomics screens in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deleted for Ulk1/2 reveal that ULK loss significantly alters the phosphoproteome, with novel high confidence substrates identified including VPS34 complex member VPS15 and AMPK complex subunit PRKAG2. We identify six ULK-dependent phosphorylation sites on VPS15, mutation of which reduces autophagosome formation in cells and VPS34 activity in vitro. Mutation of serine 861, the major VPS15 phosphosite, decreases both autophagy initiation and autophagic flux. Analysis of VPS15 knockout cells reveals two novel ULK-dependent phenotypes downstream of VPS15 removal that can be partially recapitulated by chronic VPS34 inhibition, starvation-independent accumulation of ULK substrates and kinase activity-regulated recruitment of autophagy proteins to ubiquitin-positive structures.

Revealing the Structural Plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 Using Structural Proteomics (HDX-MS)	HDX-MS, SARS-CoV-2, nsp7, nsp8	Coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural proteins (nsps) assemble to form the replication-transcription complex (RTC) responsible for viral RNA synthesis. nsp7 and nsp8 are important cofactors of the RTC, as they interact and regulate the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other nsps. To date, no structure of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp7:nsp8 complex has been published. The current understanding of this complex is based on structures from truncated constructs, with missing electron densities, or from related CoV species where SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 share upward of 90% sequence identity. Despite available structures solved using crystallography and cryo-EM representing detailed static snapshots of the nsp7:nsp8 complex, it is evident that the complex has a high degree of structural plasticity. However, relatively little is known about the conformational dynamics of the individual proteins and how they complex to interact with other nsps. Here, the solution-based structural proteomic techniques, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), illuminate the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 full-length nsp7 and nsp8 proteins and the nsp7:nsp8 protein complex. Results presented from the two techniques are complementary and validate the interaction surfaces identified from the published three-dimensional heterotetrameric crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 truncated nsp7:nsp8 complex. Furthermore, mapping of XL-MS data onto higher-order complexes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 do not assemble into a hexadecameric structure as implied by the SARS-CoV full-length nsp7:nsp8 crystal structure. Instead, our results suggest that the nsp7:nsp8 heterotetramer can dissociate into a stable dimeric unit that might bind to nsp12 in the RTC without significantly altering nsp7-nsp8 interactions.
PXD023419	34121409	Mass Spectrometry-Based De Novo Sequencing of Monoclonal Antibodies Using Multiple Proteases and a Dual Fragmentation Scheme. 	MS-based sequencing of the anti-FLAG-M2 antibody	EThcD, antibody, de novo sequencing, stepped HCD	Antibody sequence information is crucial to understanding the structural basis for antigen binding and enables the use of antibodies as therapeutics and research tools. Here, we demonstrate a method for direct de novo sequencing of monoclonal IgG from the purified antibody products. The method uses a panel of multiple complementary proteases to generate suitable peptides for de novo sequencing by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in a bottom-up fashion. Furthermore, we apply a dual fragmentation scheme, using both stepped high-energy collision dissociation (stepped HCD) and electron-transfer high-energy collision dissociation (EThcD), on all peptide precursors. The method achieves full sequence coverage of the monoclonal antibody herceptin, with an accuracy of 99% in the variable regions. We applied the method to sequence the widely used anti-FLAG-M2 mouse monoclonal antibody, which we successfully validated by remodeling a high-resolution crystal structure of the Fab and demonstrating binding to a FLAG-tagged target protein in Western blot analysis. The method thus offers robust and reliable sequences of monoclonal antibodies.
PXD028419	34122009	Cannabidiol Displays Proteomic Similarities to Antipsychotics in Cuprizone-Exposed Human Oligodendrocytic Cell Line MO3.13. 	Cannabidiol displays proteomic similarities to antipsychotics in cuprizone-exposed human oligodendrocytic cell line MO3.13	MO3.13 cell line, benztropine, clozapine, haloperidol, phytocannabinoid, schizophrenia	Cannabidiol, a compound of Cannabis sativa, has been proposed as an alternative treatment of schizophrenia. Preclinical and clinical data have suggested that cannabidiol shares more similarity with atypical antipsychotics than typical, both of which are customarily used to manage schizophrenia symptoms. While oligodendrocytes are known to be relevant targets of antipsychotics, the biochemical knowledge in this regard is still limited. Here we evaluated the molecular pathways modulated by cannabidiol compared to the antipsychotics clozapine (atypical) and haloperidol (typical), additionally evaluating the effects of benztropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist that displays a protective effect in oligodendrocytes and myelination. For this purpose, we employed nano-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate the proteomic response to these drugs both in healthy oligodendrocytic cells and in a cuprizone-based toxicity model, using the human oligodendrocyte precursor cell line MO3.13. Cannabidiol shares similarities of biochemical pathways with clozapine and benztropine, in agreement with other studies that indicated an atypical antipsychotic profile. All drugs tested affected metabolic and gene expression pathways and cannabidiol, benztropine, and clozapine modulated cell proliferation and apoptosis when administered after cuprizone-induced toxicity. These general pathways are associated with cuprizone-induced cytotoxicity in MO3.13 cells, indicating a possible proteomic approach when acting against the toxic effects of cuprizone. In conclusion, although modeling oligodendrocytic cytotoxicity with cuprizone does not represent the entirety of the pathophysiology of oligodendrocyte impairments, these results provide insight into the mechanisms associated with the effects of cannabidiol and antipsychotics against cuprizone toxicity, offering new directions of study for myelin-related processes and deficits.
PXD023417	34122441	Proteomic Analysis of Humoral Immune Components in Bronchoalveolar Lavage of Patients Infected or Colonized by Aspergillus fumigatus. 	Proteomic analysis of humoral immune components in bronchoalveolar lavage of patients infected or colonized by Aspergillus fumigatus	Aspergillus fumigatus, alveolar humoral factors, bronchoalveolar lavage	Humoral immune components have been individually studied in the context of interaction of host with Aspergillus fumigatus, a major airborne fungal pathogen. However, a global view of the multitude and complex nature of humoral immune components is needed to bring new insight into host-Aspergillus interaction. Therefore, we undertook comparative proteomic analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collected from individuals infected or colonized with A. fumigatus versus controls, to identify those alveolar humoral components affected upon A. fumigatus infection. Complement proteins C1q, C8 beta-chain, factor-H, ficolin-1, ficolin-2, mannan binding lectin serine peptidase 2, pentraxin-3 and the surfactant protein-D were identified as the major humoral immune components affected by A. fumigatus infection and colonization. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that crosstalk between these humoral components is essential during host-Aspergillus interaction giving new specific leads to study for better understanding the pathogenesis. Furthermore, the affected humoral components could be potential diagnostic markers of A. fumigatus infection or colonization.
PXD025159	34124073	Echinoderm Microtubule Associated Protein Like 1 Is Indispensable for Oocyte Spindle Assembly and Meiotic Progression in Mice. 	Echinoderm microtubule-associated protein 1 is indispensable for oocyte spindle assembly and meiotic progression in mice	EML1,oocyte	Completion of the first meiosis is an essential prerequisite for producing a functionally normal egg for fertilization and embryogenesis, but the precise mechanisms governing oocyte meiotic progression remains largely unclear. Here, we report that echinoderm microtubule associated protein (EMAP) like 1 (EML1), a member of the conserved EMAP family proteins, plays a crucial role in the control of oocyte meiotic progression in the mouse. Female mice carrying an ENU-induced nonsense mutation (c.1956T > A; p.Tyr652(*)) of Eml1 are infertile, and the majority of their ovulated oocytes contain abnormal spindles and misaligned chromosomes. In accordance with the mutant oocyte phenotype, we find that EML1 is colocalized with spindle microtubules during the process of normal oocyte meiotic maturation, and knockdown (KD) of EML1 by specific morpholinos in the fully grown oocytes (FGOs) disrupts the integrity of spindles, and delays meiotic progression. Moreover, EML1-KD oocytes fail to progress to metaphase II (MII) stage after extrusion of the first polar body, but enter into interphase and form a pronucleus containing decondensed chromatins. Further analysis shows that EML1-KD impairs the recruitment of gamma-tubulin and pericentrin to the spindle poles, as well as the attachment of kinetochores to microtubules and the proper inactivation of spindle assembly checkpoint at metaphase I (MI). The loss of EML1 also compromises the activation of maturation promoting factor around the time of oocyte resumption and completion of the first meiosis, which, when corrected by WEE1/2 inhibitor PD166285, efficiently rescues the phenotype of oocyte delay of meiotic resumption and inability of reaching MII. Through IP- mass spectrometry analysis, we identified that EML1 interacts with nuclear distribution gene C (NUDC), a critical mitotic regulator in somatic cells, and EML1-KD disrupts the specific localization of NUDC at oocyte spindles. Taken together, these data suggest that EML1 regulates acentrosomal spindle formation and the progression of meiosis to MII in mammalian oocytes, which is likely mediated by distinct mechanisms.
PXD024996	34124444	Proteomic Analysis Reveals That Metformin Suppresses PSMD2, STIP1, and CAP1 for Preventing Gastric Cancer AGS Cell Proliferation and Migration. 	iTRAQ analysis of Metformin treated AGS cells	iTRAQ	Metformin is one of the most widely used anti-diabetic drugs in type-II diabetes treatment. The mechanism of decreasing blood glucose is believed to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis by increasing muscular glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. Recent studies suggest that metformin may reduce cancer risk; however, its anticancer mechanism in gastric cancers remains unclear. Here, we aim to evaluate the anticancer effects of metformin on human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells. Our results showed that metformin inhibited AGS cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Using small-scale quantitative proteomics, we identified 177 differentially expressed proteins upon metformin treatment; among these, nine proteins such as 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 2 (PSMD2), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), and adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) were significantly altered. We found that metformin induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, suppressed cell migration, and affected cytoskeleton distribution. Additionally, patients with highly expressed PSMD2, STIP1, and CAP1 have a poor clinical outcome. Our study provides a novel view of developing therapies for gastric cancer.
PXD012577	34124447	Time-Dependent Analysis of Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans pAO1 Nicotine-Related Proteome. 	Time-dependent analysis of Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans pAO1 nicotine-related proteome	Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans, citrate medium, metabolism, nicotine	Paenarthrobacter nicotinovorans is a soil Gram-positive nicotine-degrading microorganism (NDM) that harbors a 165 kb pAO1 catabolic megaplasmid. The nicotine catabolic genes on pAO1 have been sequenced, but not all the details on the regulation and interplay of this pathway with the general metabolism of the cell are available. To address this issue at the protein level, a time-based shotgun proteomics study was performed. P. nicotinovorans was grown in the presence or absence of nicotine, and the cells were harvested at three different time intervals: 7, 10, and 24 h after inoculation. The cells were lysed, separated on SDS-PAGE, and digested by in-gel digestion using trypsin, and the resulting peptide mixture was analyzed using nanoliquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We found an extensive number of proteins that are both plasmidal- and chromosomal-encoded and that work together in the energetic metabolism via the Krebs cycle and nicotine pathway. These data provide insight into the adaptation of the bacterial cells to the nicotine metabolic intermediates and could serve as a basis for future attempts to genetically engineer the pAO1-encoded catabolic pathway for increased bioremediation efficiency or for the production of valuable chemicals. The mass-spectrometry-based proteomics data have been deposited to the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD012577.
PXD024422	34124458	Identification of Altered Proteins in the Plasma of Rats With Chronic Prostatic Inflammation Induced by Estradiol Benzoate and Sex Hormones. 	Identification of Altered Proteins in the Plasma of Rats with Chronic Prostatic Inflammation Induced by Estradiol Benzoate and Sex Hormones	chronic inflammation, estradiol, estradiol benzoate, plasma, prostate, rats, testosterone	The cause of nonbacterial chronic prostatitis is unknown, yet its prevalence accounts for more than 90% of all prostatitis cases. Whole blood, plasma, and serum have been used to identify prostate cancer biomarkers; however, few studies have performed protein profiling to identify prostatitis biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to identify protein biomarkers altered by chronic prostatitis. To perform the study, we chemically induced chronic prostate inflammation in Sprague Dawley rats using estradiol benzoate (EB), testosterone (T), and estradiol (E) and then examined protein levels in their plasma. Plasma was collected on postnatal days (PNDs) 90, 100, 145, and 200; plasma proteins were profiled using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Chronic inflammation was observed in the rat prostate induced with EB on PNDs 1, 3, and 5. Rats then were dosed with T+E during PNDs 90-200 via subcutaneous implants. We identified time-specific expression for several proteins (i.e., CFB, MYH9, AZGP1). Some altered proteins that were expressed in the prostate (i.e., SERPINF1, CTR9) also were identified in the rat plasma in the EB+T+E group on PNDs 145 and 200. These findings suggest that the identified proteins could be used as biomarkers of chronic prostatitis. Further studies are needed to verify the results in human samples.
PXD023587	34124897	Identification of 7 000-9 000 Proteins from Cell Lines and Tissues by Single-Shot Microflow LC-MS/MS. 	Micro-flow LC-MS/MS Based Single Shot Proteomics	1.0 mm ID column, Micro-flow LC, Single Shot Proteomics	A current trend in proteomics is to acquire data in a "single-shot" by LC-MS/MS because it simplifies workflows and promises better throughput and quantitative accuracy than schemes that involve extensive sample fractionation. However, single-shot approaches can suffer from limited proteome coverage when performed by data dependent acquisition (ssDDA) on nanoflow LC systems. For applications where sample quantities are not scarce, this study shows that high proteome coverage can be obtained using a microflow LC-MS/MS system operating a 1 mm i.d. x 150 mm column, at a flow-rate of 50 muL/min and coupled to an Orbitrap HF-X mass spectrometer. The results demonstrate the identification of ~9 000 proteins from 50 mug of protein digest from Arabidopsis roots, 7 500 from mouse thymus, and 7 300 from human breast cancer cells in 3 h of analysis time in a single run. The dynamic range of protein quantification measured by the iBAQ approach spanned 5 orders of magnitude and replicate analysis showed that the median coefficient of variation was below 20%. Together, this study shows that ssDDA by muLC-MS/MS is a robust method for comprehensive and large-scale proteome analysis and which may be further extended to more rapid chromatography and data independent acquisition approaches in the future..
PXD023531	34124911	Crosstalk of the IkappaB Kinase with Spliced X-Box Binding Protein 1 Couples Inflammation with Glucose Metabolic Reprogramming in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition. 	Time-series proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis of human airway epithelial cells in the absence or presence of a specific IKK inhibitor	IÎºB kinase-NFÎºB, N-glycosylation, and hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, extracellular matrix, unfolded protein response	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in airway injury, repair, and structural remodeling. IkappaB kinase (IKK)-NFkappaB signaling regulates late EMT-associated gene expression. However, IKK-mediated mesenchymal transition occurs earlier than NFkappaB/RelA subunit-dependent EMT gene expression, leading us to investigate the hypothesis that IKK plays an independent mechanism in transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)-induced EMT. Time-resolved dissection of early proteome and phosphoproteome changes in response to TGFbeta and a specific IKK inhibitor, BMS-345541, revealed that IKK regulates cascades of 23 signaling pathways essential in EMT, including TGFbeta signaling, p38 mitogen associate protein kinase (MAPK), Toll receptor signaling, and integrin pathways. We identified early IKK-dependent phosphorylation of core regulatory proteins in essential EMT signaling cassettes, including ATF2, JUN, NFKB1/p105, and others. Interestingly, we found that IKKbeta directly complexes with and phosphorylates the spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1s). XBP1s is an arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that activates the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), a pathway that mediates protein N-glycosylation and survival from ER stress-induced apoptosis in EMT. We found that inhibition of IKK activity abolishes the phosphorylation of XBP1-T48, blocks XBP1s nuclear translocation, and inhibits the activation of HBP. Our study elucidates a previously unrecognized IKKbeta-XBP1s-HBP crosstalk pathway that couples inflammation and glucose metabolic reprogramming in ETM. Because XBP1-HBP controls N-glycosylation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in EMT, this novel IKKbeta-XBP1-HBP pathway may contain therapeutic targets whose inhibition could prevent ECM remodeling in lung fibrosis or other airway remodeling diseases.
PXD024898	34125248	R1441G but not G2019S mutation enhances LRRK2 mediated Rab10 phosphorylation in human peripheral blood neutrophils. 	R1441G but not G201S mutation enhances LRRK2 mediated Rab10 phosphorylation in human peripheral blood neutrophils	LRRK2, PRM, Parkinsosns disease, Rab-GTPase	Heterozygous gain-of-kinase function variants in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) cause 1-2% of all cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) albeit with incomplete and age-dependent penetrance. All pathogenic LRRK2 mutations reside within the two catalytic domains of LRRK2-either in its kinase domain (e.g. G2019S) with modest effect or its ROC-COR GTPase domain (e.g. R1441G/H) with large effect on LRRK2 kinase activity. We have previously reported assays to interrogate LRRK2 kinase pathway activity in human bio-samples measuring phosphorylation of its endogenous substrate Rab10, that mirrors LRRK2 kinase activation status. Here, we isolated neutrophils from fresh peripheral blood from 101 participants including 42 LRRK2 mutation carriers (21 with the G2019S and 21 with the R1441G mutations), 27 patients with idiopathic PD, and 32 controls. Using a dual approach, LRRK2 dependent Rab10 phosphorylation at Threonine 73 (pRab10(Thr73)) was measured by quantitative multiplexed immunoblotting for pRab10(Thr73)/total Rab10 as well as targeted mass-spectrometry for absolute pRab10(Thr73) occupancy. We found a significant over fourfold increase in pRab10(Thr73) phosphorylation in carriers of the LRRK2 R1441G mutation irrespective of clinical disease status. The effect of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, we show that LRRK2 phosphorylation at Serine 935 is not a marker for LRRK2 kinase activity in human neutrophils. When analysing pRab10(Thr73) phosphorylation in post-mortem brain samples, we observed overall high variability irrespective of clinical and LRRK2 mutation status and attributed this mainly to the adverse effect of the peri- and post-mortem period on the stability of posttranslational modifications such as protein phosphorylation. Overall, in vivo LRRK2 dependent pRab10(Thr73) phosphorylation in human peripheral blood neutrophils is a specific, robust and promising biomarker for significant LRRK2 kinase hyperactivation, as with the LRRK2 R1441G mutation. Additional readouts and/or assays may be needed to increase sensitivity to detect modest LRRK2 kinase activation, as with the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. Our assays could be useful for patient stratification and target engagement studies for LRRK2 kinase inhibitors.
PXD023383	34125911	The ribosome assembly factor Nop53 has a structural role in the formation of nuclear pre-60S intermediates, affecting late maturation events. 	Effect of Nop53 depletion on the compositional changes during pre-60S maturation	Nop53, S. cerevisiae, eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, pre-60S	Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis is an elaborate process during which ribosomal proteins assemble with the pre-rRNA while it is being processed and folded. Hundreds of assembly factors (AF) are required and transiently recruited to assist the sequential remodeling events. One of the most intricate ones is the stepwise removal of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), between the 5.8S and 25S rRNAs, that constitutes together with five AFs the pre-60S 'foot'. In the transition from nucleolus to nucleoplasm, Nop53 replaces Erb1 at the basis of the foot and recruits the RNA exosome for the ITS2 cleavage and foot disassembly. Here we comprehensively analyze the impact of Nop53 recruitment on the pre-60S compositional changes. We show that depletion of Nop53, different from nop53 mutants lacking the exosome-interacting motif, not only causes retention of the unprocessed foot in late pre-60S intermediates but also affects the transition from nucleolar state E particle to subsequent nuclear stages. Additionally, we reveal that Nop53 depletion causes the impairment of late maturation events such as Yvh1 recruitment. In light of recently described pre-60S cryo-EM structures, our results provide biochemical evidence for the structural role of Nop53 rearranging and stabilizing the foot interface to assist the Nog2 particle formation.
PXD025024	34125917	Human tRNAs with inosine 34 are essential to efficiently translate eukarya-specific low-complexity proteins. 	Human tRNAs with inosine 34 are essential to efficiently translate eukarya-specific low-complexity proteins	Inosine, Transfer RNA, cell adhesion, low-complexity proteins, mucin-like domain	The modification of adenosine to inosine at the wobble position (I34) of tRNA anticodons is an abundant and essential feature of eukaryotic tRNAs. The expansion of inosine-containing tRNAs in eukaryotes followed the transformation of the homodimeric bacterial enzyme TadA, which generates I34 in tRNAArg and tRNALeu, into the heterodimeric eukaryotic enzyme ADAT, which modifies up to eight different tRNAs. The emergence of ADAT and its larger set of substrates, strongly influenced the tRNA composition and codon usage of eukaryotic genomes. However, the selective advantages that drove the expansion of I34-tRNAs remain unknown. Here we investigate the functional relevance of I34-tRNAs in human cells and show that a full complement of these tRNAs is necessary for the translation of low-complexity protein domains enriched in amino acids cognate for I34-tRNAs. The coding sequences for these domains require codons translated by I34-tRNAs, in detriment of synonymous codons that use other tRNAs. I34-tRNA-dependent low-complexity proteins are enriched in functional categories related to cell adhesion, and depletion in I34-tRNAs leads to cellular phenotypes consistent with these roles. We show that the distribution of these low-complexity proteins mirrors the distribution of I34-tRNAs in the phylogenetic tree.
PXD020753	34125966	Acetate overflow metabolism regulates a major metabolic shift after glucose depletion in Escherichia coli. 	Eschericha coli proteomics with Tanaka and Tachikawa	Eschericha coli, SWATH	Acetate overflow refers to the metabolism by which a large part of carbon incorporated as glucose into Escherichia coli cells is catabolized and excreted as acetate into the medium. We previously found that mutants for the acetate overflow pathway enzymes phosphoacetyltransferase (Pta) and acetate kinase (AckA) showed significant diauxic growth after glucose depletion in E. coli. Here, we analyzed the underlying mechanism in the pta mutant. Proteomic and other analyses revealed an increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunits and a decrease in glyoxylate shunt enzymes, which resulted from pyruvate accumulation. Since restoration of these enzyme levels by overexpressing PdhR (pyruvate-sensing transcription factor) or deleting iclR (gene encoding a pyruvate- and glyoxylate-sensing transcription factor) alleviated the growth lag of the pta mutant after glucose depletion, these changes were considered as the reason for the phenotype. Given the evidence for decreased coenzyme A (HS-CoA) levels in the pta mutant, the growth inhibition after glucose depletion was partly explained by limited availability of HS-CoA in the cell. The findings provide insights into the role of acetate overflow in metabolic regulation, which may be useful for biotechnological applications.
PXD019824	34126877	Oxysterols Modify NLRP2 in Epithelial Cells, Identifying a Mediator of Ozone-induced Inflammation. 	Oxysterols Modify NLRP2 in Epithelial Cells, Identifying a Mediator of Ozone-induced Inflammation.	airway epithelium, alkynylated secosterol, click, lung inflammasome, ozone, protein modification, secosterols	Ozone (O3) is a prevalent air pollutant causing lung inflammation. Previous studies demonstrate that O3 oxidizes lipids, such as cholesterol, in the airway to produce oxysterols, such as secosterol A (SecoA), which are electrophiles that are capable of forming covalent linkages preferentially with lysine residues and that consequently modify protein function. The breadth of proteins modified by this oxysterol as well as the biological consequences in the lung are unknown. By using an alkynyl-tagged form of SecoA and shotgun proteomics, we identified 135 proteins as being modified in bronchial epithelial cells. Among them was NLRP2 (NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 2), which forms an alkynyl-tagged SecoA-protein adduct at lysine residue 1019 (K1019) in the terminal leucine-rich repeat region, a known regulatory region for NLR proteins. NLRP2 expression in airway epithelial cells was characterized, and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) and shRNA knockdown of NLRP2 were used to determine its function in O3-induced inflammation. No evidence for NLPR2 inflammasome formation or an NLRP2-dependent increase in caspase-1 activity in response to O3 was observed. O3-induced proinflammatory gene expression for CXCL2 and CXCL8/IL8 was further enhanced in NLRP2-KO cells, suggesting a negative regulatory role. Reconstitution of NLRP2-KO cells with the NLRP2 K1019 mutated to arginine partially blocked SecoA adduction and enhanced O3-induced IL-8 release as compared with wild-type NLRP2. Together, our findings uncover NLRP2 as a highly abundant, key component of proinflammatory signaling pathways in airway epithelial cells and as a novel mediator of O3-induced inflammation.
PXD023981	34127680	Dissecting the multi-omics atlas of the exosomes released by human lung adenocarcinoma stem-like cells. 	The multi-omic atlas of the exosomes released by human lung adenocarcinoma stem-like cells	cancer stem cells, exosomes	Lung adenocarcinoma is heterogeneous and hierarchically organized, with a subpopulation of stem-like cells (CSCs) that reside at the apex of the hierarchy, in which exosomes act as important mediators by transporting specific molecules among different cell populations. Although there have been numerous studies on tumor exosomes, the constituents and functional properties of CSC-derived exosomes are still poorly characterized. Here we present a detail transcriptome and proteome atlas of the exosomes released by human lung adenocarcinoma stem-like cells (LSLCs). The transcriptome analysis indicates the specific patterns of exosomal constituents, including the fragmentation of transcripts and the low-level presence of circular RNAs, and identifies multiple exosomal-enriched mRNAs and lncRNAs. Integrative analysis of transcriptome and proteome data reveals the diverse functions of exosomal-enriched RNAs and proteins, many of which are associated with tumorigenesis. Importantly, several LSLC markers we identified are highly expressed in LSLC-derived exosomes and associate with poor survival, which may serve as promising liquid biopsy biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma diagnosis. Our study provides a resource for the future elucidation of the functions of tumor-derived exosomes and their regulatory mechanisms in mediating lung cancer development.
PXD023736	34127720	Exploring antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones in E. coli and K. pneumoniae using proteogenomics. 	A systematic exploration of antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae using proteogenomics	E. coli, K. pneumoniae, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, comprehensive antibiotic resistance database, data dependent acquisition, fluoroquinolones, liquid chromatography, minimum inhibitory concentrations, porins, whole	Antimicrobial resistance is mostly studied by means of phenotypic growth inhibition determinations, in combination with PCR confirmations or further characterization by means of whole genome sequencing (WGS). However, the actual proteins that cause resistance such as enzymes and a lack of porins cannot be detected by these methods. Improvements in liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) enabled easier and more comprehensive proteome analysis. In the current study, susceptibility testing, WGS and MS are combined into a multi-omics approach to analyze resistance against frequently used antibiotics within the beta-lactam, aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone group in E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Our aim was to study which currently known mechanisms of resistance can be detected at the protein level using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and to assess whether these could explain beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and fluoroquinolone resistance in the studied isolates. Furthermore, we aimed to identify significant protein to resistance correlations which have not yet been described before and to correlate the abundance of different porins in relation to resistance to different classes of antibiotics. Whole genome sequencing, high-resolution LC-MS/MS and antimicrobial susceptibility testing by broth microdilution were performed for 187 clinical E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates. Resistance genes and proteins were identified using the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD). All proteins were annotated using the NCBI RefSeq database and Prokka. Proteins of small spectrum beta-lactamases, extended spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC beta-lactamases, carbapenemases, and proteins of 16S ribosomal RNA methyltransferases and aminoglycoside acetyltransferases can be detected in E. coli and K. pneumoniae by LC-MS/MS. The detected mechanisms matched with the phenotype in the majority of isolates. Differences in the abundance and the primary structure of other proteins such as porins also correlated with resistance. LC-MS/MS is a different and complementary method which can be used to characterize antimicrobial resistance in detail as not only the primary resistance causing mechanisms are detected, but also secondary enhancing resistance mechanisms.

AR-associated coregulators and chromatin proteins hold a great potential for novel therapy targets. Here, we employed a powerful chromatin-directed proteomics approach termed ChIP-SICAP to uncover the composition of chromatin protein network, the chromatome, around endogenous AR in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. In addition to several expected AR coregulators, the chromatome contained many nuclear proteins not previously associated with the AR. In the context of androgen signaling in CRPC cells, we further investigated the role of a known AR-associated protein, a chromatin remodeler SMARCA4 and that of SIM2, a transcription factor without a previous association with AR. To understand their role in chromatin accessibility and AR target gene expression, we integrated data from ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and functional experiments. Despite the wide co-occurrence of SMARCA4 and AR on chromatin, depletion of SMARCA4 influenced chromatin accessibility and expression of a restricted set of AR target genes, especially those involved in cell morphogenetic changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The depletion also inhibited the CRPC cell growth, validating SMARCA4's functional role in CRPC cells. Although silencing of SIM2 reduced chromatin accessibility similarly, it affected the expression of a much larger group of androgen-regulated genes, including those involved in cellular responses to external stimuli and steroid hormone stimulus. The silencing also reduced proliferation of CRPC cells and tumor size in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay, further emphasizing the importance of SIM2 in CRPC cells and pointing to the functional relevance of this potential prostate cancer biomarker in CRPC cells. Overall, the chromatome of AR identified in this work is an important resource for the field focusing on this important drug target.

Structure of Tau filaments in Prion protein amyloidoses	APrP, Brain, Cryo-EM, GSS, PrP-CAA, Tau, neurodegeneration, seeding	In human neurodegenerative diseases associated with the intracellular aggregation of Tau protein, the ordered cores of Tau filaments adopt distinct folds. Here, we analyze Tau filaments isolated from the brain of individuals affected by Prion-Protein cerebral amyloid angiopathy (PrP-CAA) with a nonsense mutation in the PRNP gene that leads to early termination of translation of PrP (Q160Ter or Q160X), and Gerstmann-Straeussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease, with a missense mutation in the PRNP gene that leads to an amino acid substitution at residue 198 (F198S) of PrP. The clinical and neuropathologic phenotypes associated with these two mutations in PRNP are different; however, the neuropathologic analyses of these two genetic variants have consistently shown the presence of numerous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) made of filamentous Tau aggregates in neurons. We report that Tau filaments in PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) are composed of 3-repeat and 4-repeat Tau isoforms, having a striking similarity to NFTs in Alzheimer disease (AD). In PrP-CAA (Q160X), Tau filaments are made of both paired helical filaments (PHFs) and straight filaments (SFs), while in GSS (F198S), only PHFs were found. Mass spectrometry analyses of Tau filaments extracted from PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) brains show the presence of post-translational modifications that are comparable to those seen in Tau aggregates from AD. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that the atomic models of the Tau filaments obtained from PrP-CAA (Q160X) and GSS (F198S) are identical to those of the Tau filaments from AD, and are therefore distinct from those of Pick disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and corticobasal degeneration. Our data support the hypothesis that in the presence of extracellular amyloid deposits and regardless of the primary amino acid sequence of the amyloid protein, similar molecular mechanisms are at play in the formation of identical Tau filaments.
PXD022714	34129943	Age-Associated Proteomic Signatures and Potential Clinically Actionable Targets of Colorectal Cancer. 	Age-Associated Proteomic Hallmarks and Potential Clinically Actionable Targets of Colorectal Cancer	Colorectal cancer, NHP2, old-onset	The occurrence and prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely associated with age. More than 90% of patients with CRC are diagnosed after 50 years of age. However, CRC incidence of young individuals has been increasing since 1990s, whereas the overall CRC frequency is declining. Distinct overall survival rates between young and aged patients with CRC have been established. Tremendous efforts have been made to clarify the underlying mechanisms of age-dependent clinical differences, but it still remains elusive. Here, we performed proteomic profiling of 50 patients with CRC and revealed proteomic signatures of CRC across age groups. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that distinct age-dependent clinical outcomes might mainly attribute to varied MYC targets V1/V2, E2F targets and G2M checkpoint gene sets, which were associated with cancer cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, tumor growth, and tumor metastasis. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a large number of functional proteins, such as NOP2, CSE1L, NHP2, NOC2L and CDK1, with adjusted expression significantly correlated with age (p < 0.05). Among them, NHP2 is a core component of the telomerase complex associated with age. High NHP2 expression predicted poor overall survival, with a more significant correlation in aged patients with CRC. Knockdown of NHP2 significantly suppressed cancer cell proliferation. In addition, we revealed some age-related potential clinically actionable targets, such as PSEN1, TSPO, and CDK1, which might be more suitable for patients with late-onset CRC. Collectively, this study identifies age-associated proteomic signatures and potential therapeutic targets of CRC and may help make a precise decision on CRC treatment.
PXD024929	34131137	TSSC4 is a component of U5 snRNP that promotes tri-snRNP formation. 	SILAC APMS anlysis of TSSC4 interactome	APMS, SILAC, immunoprecipitation	U5 snRNP is a complex particle essential for RNA splicing. U5 snRNPs undergo intricate biogenesis that ensures that only a fully mature particle assembles into a splicing competent U4/U6*U5 tri-snRNP and enters the splicing reaction. During splicing, U5 snRNP is substantially rearranged and leaves as a U5/PRPF19 post-splicing particle, which requires re-generation before the next round of splicing. Here, we show that a previously uncharacterized protein TSSC4 is a component of U5 snRNP that promotes tri-snRNP formation. We provide evidence that TSSC4 associates with U5 snRNP chaperones, U5 snRNP and the U5/PRPF19 particle. Specifically, TSSC4 interacts with U5-specific proteins PRPF8, EFTUD2 and SNRNP200. We also identified TSSC4 domains critical for the interaction with U5 snRNP and the PRPF19 complex, as well as for TSSC4 function in tri-snRNP assembly. TSSC4 emerges as a specific chaperone that acts in U5 snRNP de novo biogenesis as well as post-splicing recycling.
PXD020715	34132194	Intrinsic OXPHOS limitations underlie cellular bioenergetics in leukemia. 	Mitochondrial proteome of human leuekmia.	PBMC, acute leukemia, mitochondria	Currently there is great interest in targeting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cancer. However, notwithstanding the targeting of mutant dehydrogenases, nearly all hopeful 'mito-therapeutics' cannot discriminate cancerous from non-cancerous OXPHOS and thus suffer from a limited therapeutic index. Using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a model, herein, we leveraged an in-house diagnostic biochemical workflow to identify 'actionable' bioenergetic vulnerabilities intrinsic to cancerous mitochondria. Consistent with prior reports, AML growth and proliferation was associated with a hyper-metabolic phenotype which included increases in basal and maximal respiration. However, despite having nearly 2-fold more mitochondria per cell, clonally expanding hematopoietic stem cells, leukemic blasts, as well as chemoresistant AML were all consistently hallmarked by intrinsic OXPHOS limitations. Remarkably, by performing experiments across a physiological span of ATP free energy, we provide direct evidence that leukemic mitochondria are particularly poised to consume ATP. Relevant to AML biology, acute restoration of oxidative ATP synthesis proved highly cytotoxic to leukemic blasts, suggesting that active OXPHOS repression supports aggressive disease dissemination in AML. Together, these findings argue against ATP being the primary output of leukemic mitochondria and provide proof-of-principle that restoring, rather than disrupting, OXPHOS may represent an untapped therapeutic avenue for combatting hematological malignancy and chemoresistance.
PXD021440	34133192	Sequence-Specific Model for Predicting Peptide Collision Cross Section Values in Proteomic Ion Mobility Spectrometry. 	timsTOF Pro datasets for CCS prediction	CCS prediction, SSICalc, trapped ion mobility	The contribution of peptide amino acid sequence to collision cross section values (CCS) has been investigated using a dataset of ~134 000 peptides of four different charge states (1+ to 4+). The migration data were acquired using a two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC)/trapped ion mobility spectrometry/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of HeLa cell digests created using seven different proteases and was converted to CCS values. Following the previously reported modeling approaches using intrinsic size parameters (ISP), we extended this methodology to encode the position of individual residues within a peptide sequence. A generalized prediction model was built by dividing the dataset into eight groups (four charges for both tryptic/nontryptic peptides). Position-dependent ISPs were independently optimized for the eight subsets of peptides, resulting in prediction accuracy of ~0.981 for the entire population of peptides. We find that ion mobility is strongly affected by the peptide's ability to solvate the positively charged sites. Internal positioning of polar residues and proline leads to decreased CCS values as they improve charge solvation; conversely, this ability decreases with increasing peptide charge due to electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, higher helical propensity and peptide hydrophobicity result in a preferential formation of extended structures with higher than predicted CCS values. Finally, acidic/basic residues exhibit position-dependent ISP behavior consistent with electrostatic interaction with the peptide macrodipole, which affects the peptide helicity. The MS raw data files have been deposited with the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the jPOST partner repository (http://jpostdb.org) with the dataset identifiers PXD021440/JPST000959, PXD022800/JPST001017, and PXD026087/ JPST001176.
PXD025334	34133922	Stress granules inhibit fatty acid oxidation by modulating mitochondrial permeability. 	PABPC1 stress granule interactome identified by BioID	PABPC1, stress granule	The formation of stress granules (SGs) is an essential aspect of the cellular response to many kinds of stress, but its adaptive role is far from clear. SG dysfunction is implicated in aging-onset neurodegenerative diseases, prompting interest in their physiological function. Here, we report that during starvation stress, SGs interact with mitochondria and regulate metabolic remodeling. We show that SG formation leads to a downregulation of fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) through the modulation of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs), which import fatty acids (FAs) into mitochondria. The subsequent decrease in FAO during long-term starvation reduces oxidative damage and rations FAs for longer use. Failure to form SGs, whether caused by the genetic deletion of SG components or an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated mutation, translates into an inability to downregulate FAO. Because metabolic dysfunction is a common pathological element of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, our findings provide a direction for studying the clinical relevance of SGs.
PXD023502	34135319	Structural basis of GTPase-mediated mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and recycling. 	GTPase driven maturation of the human mitoribosomal peptidyl transferase center	GTPBP5, GTPBP6, MTERF4-NSUN4, Mitochondrial ribosome, Mitoribosome, Obg-HflX superfamily, PTC maturation, ribosome assembly, ribosome recycling	Ribosome biogenesis requires auxiliary factors to promote folding and assembly of ribosomal proteins and RNA. Particularly, maturation of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) is mediated by conserved GTPases, but the molecular basis is poorly understood. Here, we define the mechanism of GTPase-driven maturation of the human mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) using endogenous complex purification, in vitro reconstitution and cryo-EM. Structures of transient native mtLSU assembly intermediates that accumulate in GTPBP6-deficient cells reveal how the biogenesis factors GTPBP5, MTERF4 and NSUN4 facilitate PTC folding. Addition of recombinant GTPBP6 reconstitutes late mtLSU biogenesis in vitro and shows that GTPBP6 triggers a molecular switch and progression to a near-mature PTC state. Additionally, cryo-EM analysis of GTPBP6-treated mature mitochondrial ribosomes reveals the structural basis for the dual-role of GTPBP6 in ribosome biogenesis and recycling. Together, these results provide a framework for understanding step-wise PTC folding as a critical conserved quality control checkpoint.
PXD023735	34135321	Limited survival and impaired hepatic fasting metabolism in mice with constitutive Rag GTPase signaling. 	A  proteomic analysis of livers from RagAGTP mice	Raga GTPases, mTORC1, metabolism, nutrient signaling.	The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates cellular nutrient signaling and hormonal cues to control metabolism. We have previously shown that constitutive nutrient signaling to mTORC1 by means of genetic activation of RagA (expression of GTP-locked RagA, or RagA(GTP)) in mice resulted in a fatal energetic crisis at birth. Herein, we rescue neonatal lethality in RagA(GTP) mice and find morphometric and metabolic alterations that span glucose, lipid, ketone, bile acid and amino acid homeostasis in adults, and a median lifespan of nine months. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses of livers from RagA(GTP) mice reveal a failed metabolic adaptation to fasting due to a global impairment in PPARalpha transcriptional program. These metabolic defects are partially recapitulated by restricting activation of RagA to hepatocytes, and revert by pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1. Constitutive hepatic nutrient signaling does not cause hepatocellular damage and carcinomas, unlike genetic activation of growth factor signaling upstream of mTORC1. In summary, RagA signaling dictates dynamic responses to feeding-fasting cycles to tune metabolism so as to match the nutritional state.
PXD011764	34136404	N-Myristoylation by NMT1 Is POTEE-Dependent to Stimulate Liver Tumorigenesis via Differentially Regulating Ubiquitination of Targets. 	N-myristoylation by NMT1 is POTEE-dependent to stimulate liver tumorigenesis via differentially regulating ubiquitination of targets	N-myristoylation by NMT1 is POTEE-dependent to stimulate liver tumorigenesis via differentially regulating ubiquitination of targets	BACKGROUND: A tremendous amount of studies have suggested that post-translational modifications (PTMs) play pivotal roles during tumorigenesis. Compared to other PTMs, lipid modification is less studied. Recently, N-myristoylation, one type of lipid modification, has been paid attention to the field of cancer. However, whether and how N-myristoylation exerts its roles in liver tumorigenesis still remains unclear. METHODS: Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was conducted to evaluate the expression of protein modification enzymes in paired tissues. Liver conditionally knocking NMT1 out mice model was used to assess the critical roles of N-myristoylation during liver tumorigenesis. Proteomics isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTraq) was performed to identify proteins that changed while NMT1 was knocked down. The click chemistry assay was used to evaluate the N-myristoylation levels of proteins. RESULTS: Here, N-myristolyation and its enzyme NMT1, but not NMT2, were found to be critical in liver cancer. Two categories of proteins, i.e., N-myristolyation down-regulated proteins (NDP, including LXN, RPL29, and FAU) and N-myristolyation up-regulated proteins (NUP, including AHSG, ALB, and TF), were revealed negatively and positively regulated by NMT1, respectively. Both NDP and NUP could be N-myristolyated by NMT1 indispensable of POTEE. However, N-myristolyation decreased and increased stability of NDP and NUP, respectively. Mechanistically, NDP-specific binding protein RPL7A facilitated HIST1H4H, which has ubiquitin E3 ligase function, to ubiquitinate NDP. By contrast, NUP-specific binding protein HBB prevented NUP from ubiquitination by HIST1H4H. Notably, function of RPL7A and HBB was all NMT1-dependent. Moreover, NDP suppressed while NUP stimulated transformative phenotypes. Clinically, higher levels of NMT1 and NUP with lower levels of NDP had worse prognostic outcome. CONCLUSION: Collectively, N-myristolyation by NMT1 suppresses anti-tumorigenic NDP, whereas it stimulates pro-tumorigenic NUP by interfering their ubiquitination to finally result in a pro-tumorigenic outcome in liver cancer. Targeting N-myristolyation and NMT1 might be helpful to treat liver cancer.
PXD021893	34136904	Quantification of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 by Immunopeptide Enrichment and Targeted Mass Spectrometry in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded and Frozen Breast Cancer Tissues. 	Quantification of HER2 by Immunopeptide Enrichment and Targeted Mass Spectrometry in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) and Frozen Breast Cancer Tissues	FFPE, Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded, HER2, breast cancer, immuno-MRM, immunopeptide enrichment, microheterogeneity, multiple reaction monitoring, targeted mass spectrometry	BACKGROUND: Conventional HER2-targeting therapies improve outcomes for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (BC), defined as tumors showing HER2 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry and/or ERBB2 gene amplification determined by in situ hybridization (ISH). Emerging HER2-targeting compounds show benefit in some patients with neither HER2 protein overexpression nor ERBB2 gene amplification, creating a need for new assays to select HER2-low tumors for treatment with these compounds. We evaluated the analytical performance of a targeted mass spectrometry-based assay for quantifying HER2 protein in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and frozen BC biopsies. METHODS: We used immunoaffinity-enrichment coupled to multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (immuno-MRM-MS) to quantify HER2 protein (as peptide GLQSLPTHDPSPLQR) in 96 frozen and 119 FFPE BC biopsies. We characterized linearity, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), and intra- and inter-day variation of the assay in frozen and FFPE tissue matrices. We determined concordance between HER2 immuno-MRM-MS and predicate immunohistochemistry and ISH assays and examined the benefit of multiplexing the assay to include proteins expressed in tumor subcompartments (e.g., stroma, adipose, lymphocytes, epithelium) to account for tissue heterogeneity. RESULTS: HER2 immuno-MRM-MS assay linearity was >=103, assay coefficient of variation was 7.8% (FFPE) and 5.9% (frozen) for spiked-in analyte, and 7.7% (FFPE) and 7.9% (frozen) for endogenous measurements. Immuno-MRM-MS-based HER2 measurements strongly correlated with predicate assay HER2 determinations, and concordance was improved by normalizing to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. HER2 was quantified above the LLOQ in all tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Immuno-MRM-MS can be used to quantify HER2 in FFPE and frozen BC biopsies, even at low HER2 expression levels.
PXD024017	34137250	Ultrasensitive NanoLC-MS of Subnanogram Protein Samples Using Second Generation Micropillar Array LC Technology with Orbitrap Exploris 480 and FAIMS PRO. 	Ultra-sensitive proteomics using second generation micro pillar array LC technology with Orbitrap Explorisâ„¢ 480 and FAIMS	ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, low-input proteomics, micro pillar, single sell proteomics	In the light of the ongoing single-cell revolution, scientific disciplines are combining forces to retrieve as much relevant data as possible from trace amounts of biological material. For single-cell proteomics, this implies optimizing the entire workflow from initial cell isolation down to sample preparation, liquid chromatography (LC) separation, mass spectrometer (MS) data acquisition, and data analysis. To demonstrate the potential for single-cell and limited sample proteomics, we report on a series of benchmarking experiments where we combine LC separation on a new generation of micropillar array columns with state-of-the-art Orbitrap MS/MS detection and high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS). This dedicated limited sample column has a reduced cross section and micropillar dimensions that have been further downscaled (interpillar distance and pillar diameter by a factor of 2), resulting in improved chromatography at reduced void times. A dilution series of a HeLa tryptic digest (5-0.05 ng/muL) was used to explore the sensitivity that can be achieved. Comparative processing of the MS/MS data with Sequest HT, MS Amanda, Mascot, and SpectroMine pointed out the benefits of using Sequest HT together with INFERYS when analyzing sample amounts below 1 ng. Here, 2855 protein groups were identified from just 1 ng of HeLa tryptic digest hereby increasing detection sensitivity as compared to a previous contribution by a factor well above 10. By successfully identifying 1486 protein groups from as little as 250 pg of HeLa tryptic digest, we demonstrate outstanding sensitivity with great promise for use in limited sample proteomics workflows.
PXD021874	34138841	Comprehensive glycoproteomics shines new light on the complexity and extent of glycosylation in archaea. 	Glycoproteomic analysis of Haloferax volcanii strains H53, DaglB, and Dagl15	Haloferax volcanii, archaea, glycoproteomics, glycosylation	Glycosylation is one of the most complex posttranslational protein modifications. Its importance has been established not only for eukaryotes but also for a variety of prokaryotic cellular processes, such as biofilm formation, motility, and mating. However, comprehensive glycoproteomic analyses are largely missing in prokaryotes. Here, we extend the phenotypic characterization of N-glycosylation pathway mutants in Haloferax volcanii and provide a detailed glycoproteome for this model archaeon through the mass spectrometric analysis of intact glycopeptides. Using in-depth glycoproteomic datasets generated for the wild-type (WT) and mutant strains as well as a reanalysis of datasets within the Archaeal Proteome Project (ArcPP), we identify the largest archaeal glycoproteome described so far. We further show that different N-glycosylation pathways can modify the same glycosites under the same culture conditions. The extent and complexity of the Hfx. volcanii N-glycoproteome revealed here provide new insights into the roles of N-glycosylation in archaeal cell biology.
PXD025752	34139154	A time-resolved proteomic and prognostic map of COVID-19. 	A time-resolved proteomic and prognostic map of COVID-19	Covid-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, Sars-Cov2, plasma, scanningSWATH	COVID-19 is highly variable in its clinical presentation, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe organ damage and death. We characterized the time-dependent progression of the disease in 139 COVID-19 inpatients by measuring 86 accredited diagnostic parameters, such as blood cell counts and enzyme activities, as well as untargeted plasma proteomes at 687 sampling points. We report an initial spike in a systemic inflammatory response, which is gradually alleviated and followed by a protein signature indicative of tissue repair, metabolic reconstitution, and immunomodulation. We identify prognostic marker signatures for devising risk-adapted treatment strategies and use machine learning to classify therapeutic needs. We show that the machine learning models based on the proteome are transferable to an independent cohort. Our study presents a map linking routinely used clinical diagnostic parameters to plasma proteomes and their dynamics in an infectious disease.
PXD023651	34139236	Development of selective protease inhibitors via engineering of the bait region of human alpha2-macroglobulin. 	A2M bait region engineering - autoconjugation product cross-link identification and PRM quantification	A2M, PRM, cross-link, protease inhibitor, protein engineering	Human alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) is an abundant protease inhibitor in plasma, which regulates many proteolytic processes and is involved in innate immunity. A2M's unique protease-trapping mechanism of inhibition is initiated when a protease cleaves within the exposed and highly susceptible "bait region." As the wild-type bait region is permissive to cleavage by most human proteases, A2M is accordingly a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor. In this study, we extensively modified the bait region in order to identify any potential functionally important elements in the bait region sequence and to engineer A2M proteins with restrictive bait regions, which more selectively inhibit a target protease. A2M in which the bait region was entirely replaced by glycine-serine repeats remained fully functional and was not cleaved by any tested protease. Therefore, this bait region was designated as the "tabula rasa" bait region and used as the starting point for further bait region engineering. Cleavage of the tabula rasa bait region by specific proteases was conveyed by the insertion of appropriate substrate sequences, e.g., basic residues for trypsin. Screening and optimization of tabula rasa bait regions incorporating matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) substrate sequences produced an A2M that was specifically cleaved by MMPs and inhibited MMP2 cleavage activity as efficiently as wild-type A2M. We propose that this approach can be used to develop A2M-based protease inhibitors, which selectively inhibit target proteases, which might be applied toward the clinical inhibition of dysregulated proteolysis as occurs in arthritis and many types of cancer.
PXD022984	34139237	The RNA-binding protein Nab2 regulates the proteome of the developing Drosophila brain. 	Nab2 Drosophila pupal brain LC-MSMS	Drosophila melanogaster, Nab2	The human ZC3H14 gene, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed polyadenosine zinc finger RNA-binding protein, is mutated in an inherited form of autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic intellectual disability. To gain insight into neurological functions of ZC3H14, we previously developed a Drosophila melanogaster model of ZC3H14 loss by deleting the fly ortholog, Nab2. Studies in this invertebrate model revealed that Nab2 controls final patterns of neuron projection within fully developed adult brains, but the role of Nab2 during development of the Drosophila brain is not known. Here, we identify roles for Nab2 in controlling the dynamic growth of axons in the developing brain mushroom bodies, which support olfactory learning and memory, and regulating abundance of a small fraction of the total brain proteome. The group of Nab2-regulated brain proteins, identified by quantitative proteomic analysis, includes the microtubule-binding protein Futsch, the neuronal Ig-family transmembrane protein turtle, the glial:neuron adhesion protein contactin, the Rac GTPase-activating protein tumbleweed, and the planar cell polarity factor Van Gogh, which collectively link Nab2 to the processes of brain morphogenesis, neuroblast proliferation, circadian sleep/wake cycles, and synaptic development. Overall, these data indicate that Nab2 controls the abundance of a subset of brain proteins during the active process of wiring the pupal brain mushroom body and thus provide a window into potentially conserved functions of the Nab2/ZC3H14 RNA-binding proteins in neurodevelopment.
PXD021197	34139362	Proteome Profiling of Recombinant DNase Therapy in Reducing NETs and Aiding Recovery in COVID-19 Patients. 	COVID-19 proteome profiling reveals resolution of inflammatory pathways and respiratory distress after DNase treatment	Covid-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, human plasma DIA SWATH-MS covid-19 HF-X	Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can result in pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. Accumulation of mucus in the airways is a hallmark of the disease and can result in hypoxemia. Here, we show that quantitative proteome analysis of the sputum from severe patients with COVID-19 reveal high levels of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) components, which was confirmed by microscopy. Extracellular DNA from excessive NET formation can increase sputum viscosity and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recombinant human DNase (Pulmozyme; Roche) has been shown to be beneficial in reducing sputum viscosity and improve lung function. We treated five patients pwith COVID-19 resenting acute symptoms with clinically approved aerosolized Pulmozyme. No adverse reactions to the drug were seen, and improved oxygen saturation and recovery in all severely ill patients with COVID-19 was observed after therapy. Immunofluorescence and proteome analysis of sputum and blood plasma samples after treatment revealed a marked reduction of NETs and a set of statistically significant proteome changes that indicate reduction of hemorrhage, plasma leakage and inflammation in the airways, and reduced systemic inflammatory state in the blood plasma of patients. Taken together, the results indicate that NETs contribute to acute respiratory failure in COVID-19 and that degrading NETs may reduce dependency on external high-flow oxygen therapy in patients. Targeting NETs using recombinant human DNase may have significant therapeutic implications in COVID-19 disease and warrants further studies.
PXD023747	34140353	Divergent evolution toward sex chromosome-specific gene regulation in Drosophila. 	Divergent evolutionary strategies for selective sex chromosome regulation in Drosophila	MSL2, dosage compensation, evolution, long non-coding RNA, roX, targeting, virilis	The dosage compensation complex (DCC) of Drosophila identifies its X-chromosomal binding sites with exquisite selectivity. The principles that assure this vital targeting are known from the D. melanogaster model: DCC-intrinsic specificity of DNA binding, cooperativity with the CLAMP protein, and noncoding roX2 RNA transcribed from the X chromosome. We found that in D. virilis, a species separated from melanogaster by 40 million years of evolution, all principles are active but contribute differently to X specificity. In melanogaster, the DCC subunit MSL2 evolved intrinsic DNA-binding selectivity for rare PionX sites, which mark the X chromosome. In virilis, PionX motifs are abundant and not X-enriched. Accordingly, MSL2 lacks specific recognition. Here, roX2 RNA plays a more instructive role, counteracting a nonproductive interaction of CLAMP and modulating DCC binding selectivity. Remarkably, roX2 triggers a stable chromatin binding mode characteristic of DCC. Evidently, X-specific regulation is achieved by divergent evolution of protein, DNA, and RNA components.
PXD026063	34140499	An anchoring complex recruits katanin for microtubule severing at the plant cortical nucleation sites. 	Arabidopsis Wdr8 interactors identification	Arabidopsis seedlings, GFP antibody coupled immunoprecipitation	Microtubules are severed by katanin at distinct cellular locations to facilitate reorientation or amplification of dynamic microtubule arrays, but katanin targeting mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that a centrosomal microtubule-anchoring complex is used to recruit katanin in acentrosomal plant cells. The conserved protein complex of Msd1 (also known as SSX2IP) and Wdr8 is localized at microtubule nucleation sites along the microtubule lattice in interphase Arabidopsis cells. Katanin is recruited to these sites for efficient release of newly formed daughter microtubules. Our cell biological and genetic studies demonstrate that Msd1-Wdr8 acts as a specific katanin recruitment factor to cortical nucleation sites (but not to microtubule crossover sites) and stabilizes the association of daughter microtubule minus ends to their nucleation sites until they become severed by katanin. Molecular coupling of sequential anchoring and severing events by the evolutionarily conserved complex renders microtubule release under tight control of katanin activity.
PXD021477	34140620	HER2-antigen-specific humoral immune response in breast cancer lymphocytes transplanted in hu-PBL hIL-4 NOG mice. 	Proteomics of Human and Mouse serum protein	mass spectrometry analysis, serum protein	The status of humoral immunity of cancer patients is not clear compared to cellular immunity because the ability of specific antibody production is difficult to analyze in vitro. We previously developed a humanized mouse model to evaluate antigen-specific antibody production by transplanting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into NOG-hIL-4-Tg mice (hu-PBL hIL-4 NOG). In this study, these mice were transplanted with PBMCs derived from breast cancer patients (BC) and immunized with a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) peptide, CH401MAP, to analyze humoral immunity of BCs. The hu-PBL hIL-4 NOG mice recapitulated immune environment of BCs as the ratio of CD8+/CD4+T cells was lower and that of PD-1 + T cells was higher compared to healthy donors (HDs). Diverse clusters were detected in BC-mouse (BC-M) plasma components involving immunoglobulins and complements unlike HD-M, and there was a significant diversity in CH401MAP-specific IgG titers in BC-M. The number of B cell clones producing high CH401MAP-specific IgG was not increased by immunization in BC-M unlike HD-M. These results demonstrated that the humoral immunity of BCs appeared as diverse phenotypes different from HDs in hu-PBL hIL-4 NOG mice, which may provide important information for the study of personalized medicine.
PXD025736	34140676	Dnmt1 has de novo activity targeted to transposable elements. 	Dnmt1 has de novo activity targeted to transposable elements	DNA methylation, Dnmt1, Uhrf1, retrotransposon	DNA methylation plays a critical role during development, particularly in repressing retrotransposons. The mammalian methylation landscape is dependent on the combined activities of the canonical maintenance enzyme Dnmt1 and the de novo Dnmts, 3a and 3b. Here, we demonstrate that Dnmt1 displays de novo methylation activity in vitro and in vivo with specific retrotransposon targeting. We used whole-genome bisulfite and long-read Nanopore sequencing in genetically engineered methylation-depleted mouse embryonic stem cells to provide an in-depth assessment and quantification of this activity. Utilizing additional knockout lines and molecular characterization, we show that the de novo methylation activity of Dnmt1 depends on Uhrf1, and its genomic recruitment overlaps with regions that enrich for Uhrf1, Trim28 and H3K9 trimethylation. Our data demonstrate that Dnmt1 can catalyze DNA methylation in both a de novo and maintenance context, especially at retrotransposons, where this mechanism may provide additional stability for long-term repression and epigenetic propagation throughout development.
PXD024616	34140961	Label-Free Proteomic Analysis of Smoke-Drying and Shade-Drying Processes of Postharvest Rhubarb: A Comparative Study. 	Rhubarb Proteomic Determination	Rhubarb	Postharvest processing plays a very important role in improving the quality of traditional Chinese medicine. According to previous studies, smoke-drying could significantly promote the accumulation of the bioactive components and pharmacological activities of rhubarb, but so far, the molecular mechanism has not been studied yet. In this research, to study the molecular mechanisms of postharvest processing for rhubarb during shade-drying and smoke-drying, label-free proteomic analyses were conducted. In total, 1,927 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified from rhubarb samples treated by different drying methods. These DAPs were mainly involved in response and defense, signal transduction, starch, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, and anthraquinone and phenolic acid biosynthesis. Smoke-drying significantly enhanced the expression of proteins involved in these metabolic pathways. Accordingly, the molecular mechanism of the accumulation of effective ingredients of rhubarb was clarified, which provided a novel insight into the biosynthesis of active ingredients that occur during the rhubarb dry process.
PXD019771	34142657	The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) generates heterotypic ubiquitin chains. 	The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex LUBAC generates heterotypic ubiquitin chains	E3 ubiquitin ligase/ Ester-bond linkage/ HOIL-1L/ RBR/ Ubiquitin	The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is the only known ubiquitin ligase for linear/Met1-linked ubiquitin chain formation. One of the LUBAC components, heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1 (HOIL-1L), was recently shown to catalyse oxyester bond formation between ubiquitin and some substrates. However, oxyester bond formation in the context of LUBAC has not been directly observed. Here, we present the first 3D reconstruction of human LUBAC obtained by electron microscopy and report its generation of heterotypic ubiquitin chains containing linear linkages with oxyester-linked branches. We found that this event depends on HOIL-1L catalytic activity. By cross-linking mass spectrometry showing proximity between the catalytic RING-in-between-RING (RBR) domains, a coordinated ubiquitin relay mechanism between the HOIL-1-interacting protein (HOIP) and HOIL-1L ligases is suggested. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, these heterotypic chains were induced by TNF, which is reduced in cells expressing an HOIL-1L catalytic inactive mutant. In conclusion, we demonstrate that LUBAC assembles heterotypic ubiquitin chains by the concerted action of HOIP and HOIL-1L.
PXD025238	34142686	Multi-omics data integration reveals correlated regulatory features of triple negative breast cancer. 	Multi-omics data integration reveals correlated regulatory features of triple negative breast cancer	RNA-seq, histone posttranslational modification, multi-omics data Integration, phosphoproteomics, triple negative breast cancer	Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive type of breast cancer with very little treatment options. TNBC is very heterogeneous with large alterations in the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic landscapes leading to various subtypes with differing responses to therapeutic treatments. We applied a multi-omics data integration method to evaluate the correlation of important regulatory features in TNBC BRCA1 wild-type MDA-MB-231 and TNBC BRCA1 5382insC mutated HCC1937 cells compared with non-tumorigenic epithelial breast MCF10A cells. The data includes DNA methylation, RNAseq, protein, phosphoproteomics, and histone post-translational modification. Data integration methods identified regulatory features from each omics method that had greater than 80% positive correlation within each TNBC subtype. Key regulatory features at each omics level were identified distinguishing the three cell lines and were involved in important cancer related pathways such as TGFbeta signaling, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. We observed overexpression of PTEN, which antagonizes the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and MYC, which downregulates the same pathway in the HCC1937 cells relative to the MDA-MB-231 cells. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/beta-catenin pathways are both downregulated in HCC1937 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 cells, which likely explains the divergent sensitivities of these cell lines to inhibitors of downstream signaling pathways. The DNA methylation and RNAseq data is freely available via GEO GSE171958 and the proteomics data is available via the ProteomeXchange PXD025238.
PXD024040	34143546	Thermal proteome profiling identifies PIP4K2A and ZADH2 as off-targets of Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitor volasertib. 	Investigating the target and off-target landscape of PLK1 small molecule inhibitor volasertib	LC-MS, PLK1, leukemia, volasertib	Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is an important cell cycle kinase and an attractive target for anticancer treatments. An ATP-competitive small molecular PLK1 inhibitor, volasertib, has reached phase III in clinical trials in patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia as a combination treatment with cytarabine. However, severe side effects limited its use. The origin of the side effects is unclear and might be due to insufficient specificity of the drug. Thus, identifying potential off-targets to volasertib is important for future clinical trials and for the development of more specific drugs. In this study, we used thermal proteome profiling (TPP) to identify proteome-wide targets of volasertib. Apart from PLK1 and proteins regulated by PLK1, we identified about 200 potential volasertib off-targets. Comparison of this result with the mass-spectrometry analysis of volasertib-treated cells showed that phosphatidylinositol phosphate and prostaglandin metabolism pathways are affected by volasertib. We confirmed that PIP4K2A and ZADH2-marker proteins for these pathways-are, indeed, stabilized by volasertib. PIP4K2A, however, was not affected by another PLK1 inhibitor onvansertib, suggesting that PIP4K2A is a true off-target of volasertib. Inhibition of these proteins is known to impact both the immune response and fatty acid metabolism and could explain some of the side effects seen in volasertib-treated patients.
PXD025959	34143863	Co-ordinated control of the Aurora B abscission checkpoint by PKCepsilon complex assembly, midbody recruitment and retention. 	Coordinated control of the Aurora B abscission checkpoint by PKCepsilon complex assembly, midbody recruitment and retention	14-3-3 PKCe, phosphorylation	A requirement for PKCepsilon in exiting from the Aurora B dependent abscission checkpoint is associated with events at the midbody, however, the recruitment, retention and action of PKCepsilon in this compartment are poorly understood. Here, the prerequisite for 14-3-3 complex assembly in this pathway is directly linked to the phosphorylation of Aurora B S227 at the midbody. However, while essential for PKCepsilon control of Aurora B, 14-3-3 association is shown to be unnecessary for the activity-dependent enrichment of PKCepsilon at the midbody. This localisation is demonstrated to be an autonomous property of the inactive PKCepsilon D532N mutant, consistent with activity-dependent dissociation. The C1A and C1B domains are necessary for this localisation, while the C2 domain and inter-C1 domain (IC1D) are necessary for retention at the midbody. Furthermore, it is shown that while the IC1D mutant retains 14-3-3 complex proficiency, it does not support Aurora B phosphorylation, nor rescues division failure observed with knockdown of endogenous PKCepsilon. It is concluded that the concerted action of multiple independent events facilitates PKCepsilon phosphorylation of Aurora B at the midbody to control exit from the abscission checkpoint.
PXD025896	34144039	Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta activates Abl2 via direct binding and phosphorylation. 	Identification of phosphorylation sites on Abl2	Abl2, PDGFR-beta	Abl family kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases activated by diverse cellular stimuli that regulate cytoskeleton organization, morphogenesis, and adhesion. The catalytic activity of Abl family kinases is tightly regulated in cells by a complex set of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions and post-translational modifications. For example, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta), important for cell proliferation and chemotaxis, is a potent activator of Abl family kinases. However, the molecular mechanism by which PDGFRbeta engages and activates Abl family kinases is not known. We show here that the Abl2 Src homology 2 domain directly binds to phosphotyrosine Y771 in the PDGFRbeta cytoplasmic domain. PDGFRbeta directly phosphorylates multiple novel sites on the N-terminal half of Abl2, including Y116, Y139, and Y161 within the Src homology 3 domain, and Y299, Y303, and Y310 on the kinase domain. Y116, Y161, Y272, and Y310 are all located at or near the Src homology 3/Src homology 2-kinase linker interface, which helps maintain Abl family kinases in an autoinhibited conformation. We also found that PDGFRbeta-mediated phosphorylation of Abl2 in vitro activates Abl2 kinase activity, but mutation of these four tyrosines (Y116, Y161, Y272, and Y310) to phenylalanine abrogated PDGFRbeta-mediated activation of Abl2. These findings reveal how PDGFRbeta engages and phosphorylates Abl2 leading to activation of the kinase, providing a framework to understand how growth factor receptors engage and activate Abl family kinases.
PXD018458	34145242	Arginine methylation of METTL14 promotes RNA N(6)-methyladenosine modification and endoderm differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. 	Arginine methylation of METTL14 promotes RNA N6-methyladenosine modification and endoderm differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells	METTL14, arginine methylation, endoderm differentiation, m6A	RNA N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most abundant internal modification of mRNAs, plays key roles in human development and health. Post-translational methylation of proteins is often critical for the dynamic regulation of enzymatic activity. However, the role of methylation of the core methyltransferase METTL3/METTL14 in m(6)A regulation remains elusive. We find by mass spectrometry that METTL14 arginine 255 (R255) is methylated (R255me). Global mRNA m(6)A levels are greatly decreased in METTL14 R255K mutant mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We further find that R255me greatly enhances the interaction of METTL3/METTL14 with WTAP and promotes the binding of the complex to substrate RNA. We show that protein arginine N-methyltransferases 1 (PRMT1) interacts with and methylates METTL14 at R255, and consistent with this, loss of PRMT1 reduces mRNA m(6)A modification globally. Lastly, we find that loss of R255me preferentially affects endoderm differentiation in mESCs. Collectively, our findings show that arginine methylation of METTL14 stabilizes the binding of the m(6)A methyltransferase complex to its substrate RNA, thereby promoting global m(6)A modification and mESC endoderm differentiation. This work highlights the crosstalk between protein methylation and RNA methylation in gene expression.
PXD022294	34145251	Hakai is required for stabilization of core components of the m(6)A mRNA methylation machinery. 	Hakai is required for stabilization of core components of the m6A mRNA methylation machinery	Hakai, RNA modification, m6A, sex determination	N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most abundant internal modification on mRNA which influences most steps of mRNA metabolism and is involved in several biological functions. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Hakai was previously found in complex with components of the m(6)A methylation machinery in plants and mammalian cells but its precise function remained to be investigated. Here we show that Hakai is a conserved component of the methyltransferase complex in Drosophila and human cells. In Drosophila, its depletion results in reduced m(6)A levels and altered m(6)A-dependent functions including sex determination. We show that its ubiquitination domain is required for dimerization and interaction with other members of the m(6)A machinery, while its catalytic activity is dispensable. Finally, we demonstrate that the loss of Hakai destabilizes several subunits of the methyltransferase complex, resulting in impaired m(6)A deposition. Our work adds functional and molecular insights into the mechanism of the m(6)A mRNA writer complex.
PXD018056	34145271	Structural insights into an atypical secretory pathway kinase crucial for Toxoplasma gondii invasion. 	Target identification of the novel Toxoplasma gondii rhoptry kinase RON13	Toxoplasma gondii, kinase, rhoptry	Active host cell invasion by the obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasites relies on the formation of a moving junction, which connects parasite and host cell plasma membranes during entry. Invading Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites secrete their rhoptry content and insert a complex of RON proteins on the cytoplasmic side of the host cell membrane providing an anchor to which the parasite tethers. Here we show that a rhoptry-resident kinase RON13 is a key virulence factor that plays a crucial role in host cell entry. Cryo-EM, kinase assays, phosphoproteomics and cellular analyses reveal that RON13 is a secretory pathway kinase of atypical structure that phosphorylates rhoptry proteins including the components of the RON complex. Ultimately, RON13 kinase activity controls host cell invasion by anchoring the moving junction at the parasite-host cell interface.
PXD022747	34145290	The pan-cancer lncRNA PLANE regulates an alternative splicing program to promote cancer pathogenesis. 	The pan-cancer lncRNA PLANE regulates an alternative splicing program and promotes cancer pathogenesis	Alternative splicing, PLANE, Pan-cancer, lncRNA	Genomic amplification of the distal portion of chromosome 3q, which encodes a number of oncogenic proteins, is one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in malignancy. Here we functionally characterise a non-protein product of the 3q region, the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) PLANE, which is upregulated in diverse cancer types through copy number gain as well as E2F1-mediated transcriptional activation. PLANE forms an RNA-RNA duplex with the nuclear receptor co-repressor 2 (NCOR2) pre-mRNA at intron 45, binds to heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNPM) and facilitates the association of hnRNPM with the intron, thus leading to repression of the alternative splicing (AS) event generating NCOR2-202, a major protein-coding NCOR2 AS variant. This is, at least in part, responsible for PLANE-mediated promotion of cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. These results uncover the function and regulation of PLANE and suggest that PLANE may constitute a therapeutic target in the pan-cancer context.
PXD023571	34145386	Protein phosphatase 1 regulates atypical mitotic and meiotic division in Plasmodium sexual stages. 	Protein Phosphatase 1 regulates atypical chromosome segregation and cell polarity during mitotic and meiotic division in Plasmodium sexual stages	Phosphatase, Plasmodium, Warwick-RTP, cell division, kinetochore, polarity, sexual stage	PP1 is a conserved eukaryotic serine/threonine phosphatase that regulates many aspects of mitosis and meiosis, often working in concert with other phosphatases, such as CDC14 and CDC25. The proliferative stages of the malaria parasite life cycle include sexual development within the mosquito vector, with male gamete formation characterized by an atypical rapid mitosis, consisting of three rounds of DNA synthesis, successive spindle formation with clustered kinetochores, and a meiotic stage during zygote to ookinete development following fertilization. It is unclear how PP1 is involved in these unusual processes. Using real-time live-cell and ultrastructural imaging, conditional gene knockdown, RNA-seq and proteomic approaches, we show that Plasmodium PP1 is implicated in both mitotic exit and, potentially, establishing cell polarity during zygote development in the mosquito midgut, suggesting that small molecule inhibitors of PP1 should be explored for blocking parasite transmission.
PXD018934	34145392	Methanogenic archaea use a bacteria-like methyltransferase system to demethoxylate aromatic compounds. 	New mode of methanogenesis observed in the coal degrading methanogen Methermicoccus shengliensis	Methanogen, demethoxylation, methoxylated aromatic compounds, methyl transfer	Methane-generating archaea drive the final step in anaerobic organic compound mineralization and dictate the carbon flow of Earth's diverse anoxic ecosystems in the absence of inorganic electron acceptors. Although such Archaea were presumed to be restricted to life on simple compounds like hydrogen (H2), acetate or methanol, an archaeon, Methermicoccus shengliensis, was recently found to convert methoxylated aromatic compounds to methane. Methoxylated aromatic compounds are important components of lignin and coal, and are present in most subsurface sediments. Despite the novelty of such a methoxydotrophic archaeon its metabolism has not yet been explored. In this study, transcriptomics and proteomics reveal that under methoxydotrophic growth M. shengliensis expresses an O-demethylation/methyltransferase system related to the one used by acetogenic bacteria. Enzymatic assays provide evidence for a two step-mechanisms in which the methyl-group from the methoxy compound is (1) transferred on cobalamin and (2) further transferred on the C1-carrier tetrahydromethanopterin, a mechanism distinct from conventional methanogenic methyl-transfer systems which use coenzyme M as final acceptor. We further hypothesize that this likely leads to an atypical use of the methanogenesis pathway that derives cellular energy from methyl transfer (Mtr) rather than electron transfer (F420H2 re-oxidation) as found for methylotrophic methanogenesis.
PXD025751	34150879	Biological Mechanisms Induced by Soybean Agglutinin Using an Intestinal Cell Model of Monogastric Animals. 	Effect of soybean agglutinin on biological function of gut	Food and Nutrition (B/D-HPP), Gut, ProteomeXchange project tag: Toxicoproteomics (B/D-HPP), SBA	Soybean agglutinin (SBA) has a toxic effect on most animals. The anti-nutritional mechanisms of SBA are not fully understood, in terms of cell survival activity and metabolism of intestinal cells. This study aims to investigate the effects of SBA on the cell cycle, apoptosis, and to verify the mechanism of SBA anti-nutritional characters based on proteomic-based analysis. The IPEC-J2 cell line was cultured with medium containing 0.0, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/mL SBA. With increasing SBA levels, the percentage of the cells at G0/G1 phase, cell apoptosis rates, expressions of Bax and p21, and the activities of Casp-3 and Casp-9 were increased, while cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 expressions were declined (p < 0.05). The proteomic analysis showed that the numbers of differentially expressed proteins, induced by SBA, were mainly enriched in different pathways including DNA replication, base excision repair, nucleus excision repair, mismatch repair, amide and peptide biosynthesis, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, as well as structures and functions of mitochondria and ribosome. In conclusion, the anti-nutritional mechanism of SBA is a complex cellular process. Such process including DNA related activities; protein synthesis and metabolism; signal-conducting relation; as well as subcellular structure and function. This study provides comprehensive information to understand the toxic mechanism of SBA in monogastrics.
PXD022994	34151245	Hepatocyte proteomes reveal the role of protein disulfide isomerase 4 in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. 	Proteomic analysis of in situ formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human liver tissues	Alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency, Hepatocyte, Liver, quantitative proteome	BACKGROUND & AIMS: A single point mutation in the Z-variant of alpha 1-antitrypsin (Z-AAT) alone can lead to both a protein folding and trafficking defect, preventing its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the formation of aggregates that are retained as inclusions within the ER of hepatocytes. These defects result in a systemic AAT deficiency (AATD) that causes lung disease, whereas the ER-retained aggregates can induce severe liver injury in patients with ZZ-AATD. Unfortunately, therapeutic approaches are still limited and liver transplantation represents the only curative treatment option. To overcome this limitation, a better understanding of the molecular basis of ER aggregate formation could provide new strategies for therapeutic intervention. METHODS: Our functional and omics approaches here based on human hepatocytes from patients with ZZ-AATD have enabled the identification and characterisation of the role of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) A4/ERP72 in features of AATD-mediated liver disease. RESULTS: We report that 4 members of the PDI family (PDIA4, PDIA3, P4HB, and TXNDC5) are specifically upregulated in ZZ-AATD liver samples from adult patients. Furthermore, we show that only PDIA4 knockdown or alteration of its activity by cysteamine treatment can promote Z-AAT secretion and lead to a marked decrease in Z aggregates. Finally, detailed analysis of the Z-AAT interactome shows that PDIA4 silencing provides a more conducive environment for folding of the Z mutant, accompanied by reduction of Z-AAT-mediated oxidative stress, a feature of AATD-mediated liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: PDIA4 is involved in AATD-mediated liver disease and thus represents a therapeutic target for inhibition by drugs such as cysteamine. PDI inhibition therefore represents a potential therapeutic approach for treatment of AATD. LAY SUMMARY: Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family members, and particularly PDIA4, are upregulated and involved in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-mediated liver disease in adults. PDI inhibition upon cysteamine treatment leads to improvements in features of AATD and hence represents a therapeutic approach for treatment of AATD-mediated liver disease.
PXD024254	34151850	Identification of Full-Length Wild-Type and Mutant Huntingtin Interacting Proteins by Crosslinking Immunoprecipitation in Mice Brain Cortex. 	Identification of full length wild-type and mutant huntingtin interacting proteins by crosslinking immunoprecipitation in mice brain cortex	Brain, FLAG immunoprecipitation, Huntingtons Disease	BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG expansion in the huntingtin gene, resulting in a polyglutamine expansion in the ubiquitously expressed mutant huntingtin protein. OBJECTIVE: Here we set out to identify proteins interacting with the full-length wild-type and mutant huntingtin protein in the mice cortex brain region to understand affected biological processes in Huntington's disease pathology. METHODS: Full-length huntingtin with 20 and 140 polyQ repeats were formaldehyde-crosslinked and isolated via their N-terminal Flag-tag from 2-month-old mice brain cortex. Interacting proteins were identified and quantified by label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: We identified 30 interactors specific for wild-type huntingtin, 14 interactors specific for mutant huntingtin and 14 shared interactors that interacted with both wild-type and mutant huntingtin, including known interactors such as F8a1/Hap40. Syt1, Ykt6, and Snap47, involved in vesicle transport and exocytosis, were among the proteins that interacted specifically with wild-type huntingtin. Various other proteins involved in energy metabolism and mitochondria were also found to associate predominantly with wild-type huntingtin, whereas mutant huntingtin interacted with proteins involved in translation including Mapk3, Eif3h and Eef1a2. CONCLUSION: Here we identified both shared and specific interactors of wild-type and mutant huntingtin, which are involved in different biological processes including exocytosis, vesicle transport, translation and metabolism. These findings contribute to the understanding of the roles that wild-type and mutant huntingtin play in a variety of cellular processes both in healthy conditions and Huntington's disease pathology.
PXD023170	34152049	In vivo homopropargylglycine incorporation enables sampling, isolation and characterization of nascent proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana. 	BONCAT in Arabidopsis cell culture LC-MS	BONCAT, LC-MS, cell culture, noncanoical amino acids	Determining which proteins are actively synthesized at a given point in time and extracting a representative sample for analysis is important to understand plant responses. Here we show that the methionine (Met) analogue homopropargylglycine (HPG) enables Bio-Orthogonal Non-Canonical Amino acid Tagging (BONCAT) of a small sample of the proteins being synthesized in Arabidopsis plants or cell cultures, facilitating their click-chemistry enrichment for analysis. The sites of HPG incorporation could be confirmed by peptide mass spectrometry at Met sites throughout protein amino acid sequences and correlation with independent studies of protein labelling with (15) N verified the data. We provide evidence that HPG-based BONCAT tags a better sample of nascent plant proteins than azidohomoalanine (AHA)-based BONCAT in Arabidopsis and show that the AHA induction of Met metabolism and greater inhibition of cell growth rate than HPG probably limits AHA incorporation at Met sites in Arabidopsis. We show HPG-based BONCAT provides a verifiable method for sampling, which plant proteins are being synthesized at a given time point and enriches a small portion of new protein molecules from the bulk protein pool for identification, quantitation and subsequent biochemical analysis. Enriched nascent polypeptides samples were found to contain significantly fewer common post-translationally modified residues than the same proteins from whole plant extracts, providing evidence for age-related accumulation of post-translational modifications in plants.
PXD025776	34153319	Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II-dependent regulation of betaIV-spectrin modulates cardiac fibroblast gene expression, proliferation, and contractility. 	CaMKII phosphorylates betaIV-spectrin in heart	STAT3, calmodulin kinase II, cardiac fibroblast, fibrosis, betaIV-spectrin	Fibrosis is a pronounced feature of heart disease and the result of dysregulated activation of resident cardiac fibroblasts (CFs). Recent work identified stress-induced degradation of the cytoskeletal protein betaIV-spectrin as an important step in CF activation and cardiac fibrosis. Furthermore, loss of betaIV-spectrin was found to depend on Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Therefore, we sought to determine the mechanism for CaMKII-dependent regulation of betaIV-spectrin and CF activity. Computational screening and MS revealed a critical serine residue (S2250 in mouse and S2254 in human) in betaIV-spectrin phosphorylated by CaMKII. Disruption of betaIV-spectrin/CaMKII interaction or alanine substitution of betaIV-spectrin Ser2250 (betaIV-S2254A) prevented CaMKII-induced degradation, whereas a phosphomimetic construct (betaIV-spectrin with glutamic acid substitution at serine 2254 [betaIV-S2254E]) showed accelerated degradation in the absence of CaMKII. To assess the physiological significance of this phosphorylation event, we expressed exogenous betaIV-S2254A and betaIV-S2254E constructs in betaIV-spectrin-deficient CFs, which have increased proliferation and fibrotic gene expression compared with WT CFs. betaIV-S2254A but not betaIV-S2254E normalized CF proliferation, gene expression, and contractility. Pathophysiological targeting of betaIV-spectrin phosphorylation and subsequent degradation was identified in CFs activated with the profibrotic ligand angiotensin II, resulting in increased proliferation and signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 nuclear accumulation. While therapeutic delivery of exogenous WT betaIV-spectrin partially reversed these trends, betaIV-S2254A completely negated increased CF proliferation and signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 translocation. Moreover, we observed betaIV-spectrin phosphorylation and associated loss in total protein within human heart tissue following heart failure. Together, these data illustrate a considerable role for the betaIV-spectrin/CaMKII interaction in activating profibrotic signaling.
PXD021509	34153511	High-throughput microfluidic 3D biomimetic model enabling quantitative description of the human breast tumor microenvironment. 	High throughput microfluidic 3D biomimetic model enabling quantitative description of human breast tumor microenvironment	alginate, breast cancer, microfluidics, proteomic profiling, tumor microenvironment	Cancer is driven by both genetic aberrations in the tumor cells and fundamental changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME). These changes offer potential targets for novel therapeutics, yet lack of in vitro 3D models recapitulating this complex microenvironment impedes such progress. Here, we generated several tumor-stroma scaffolds reflecting the dynamic in vivo breast TME, using a high throughput microfluidic system. Alginate (Alg) or alginate-alginate sulfate (Alg/Alg-S) hydrogels were used as ECM-mimics, enabling the encapsulation and culture of tumor cells, fibroblasts and immune cells (macrophages and T cells, of the innate and adaptive immune systems, respectively). Specifically, Alg/Alg-S was shown capable of capturing and presenting growth factors and cytokines with binding affinity that is comparable to heparin. Viability and cytotoxicity were shown to strongly correlate with the dynamics of cellular milieu, as well as hydrogel type. Using on-chip immunofluorescence, production of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were imaged and quantitatively analyzed. We then show how macrophages in our microfluidic system were shifted from a proinflammatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype when encapsulated in Alg/Alg-S, reflecting in vivo TME dynamics. LC-MS proteomic profiling of tumor cells sorted from the TME scaffolds revealed upregulation of proteins involved in cell-cell interactions and immunomodulation in Alg/Alg-S scaffolds, correlating with in vivo findings and demonstrating the appropriateness of Alg/Alg-S as an ECM biomimetic. Finally, we show the formation of large tumor-derived vesicles, formed exclusively in Alg/Alg-S scaffolds. Altogether, our system offers a robust platform for quantitative description of the breast TME that successfully recapitulates in vivo patterns. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer progression is driven by profound changes in both tumor cells and surrounding stroma. Here, we present a high throughput microfluidic system for the generation and analysis of dynamic tumor-stroma scaffolds, that mimic the complex in vivo TME cell proportions and compositions, constructing robust in vitro models for the study of the TME. Utilizing Alg/Alg-S as a bioinspired ECM, mimicking heparin's in vivo capabilities of capturing and presenting signaling molecules, we show how Alg/Alg-S induces complex in vivo-like responses in our models. Alg/Alg-S is shown here to promote dynamic protein expression patterns, that can serve as potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment. Formation of large tumor-derived vesicles, observed exclusively in the Alg/Alg-S scaffolds suggests a mechanism for tumor survival.
PXD023260	34158378	Treatment with HIV-Protease Inhibitor Nelfinavir Identifies Membrane Lipid Composition and Fluidity as a Therapeutic Target in Advanced Multiple Myeloma. 	Nelfinavir overcomes proteasome inhibitor resistance in multiple myeloma by modulating lipid bilayer composition and fluidity	ADIPOR2, CRISPR/Cas9, HIV-protease inhibitor, UPR, affinity-purification, ezetimibe, multiple myeloma, nelfinavir, proteasome inhibitors	The HIV-protease inhibitor nelfinavir has shown broad anticancer activity in various preclinical and clinical contexts. In patients with advanced, proteasome inhibitor (PI)-refractory multiple myeloma, nelfinavir-based therapy resulted in 65% partial response or better, suggesting that this may be a highly active chemotherapeutic option in this setting. The broad anticancer mechanism of action of nelfinavir implies that it interferes with fundamental aspects of cancer cell biology. We combined proteome-wide affinity-purification of nelfinavir-interacting proteins with genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screening to identify protein partners that interact with nelfinavir in an activity-dependent manner alongside candidate genetic contributors affecting nelfinavir cytotoxicity. Nelfinavir had multiple activity-specific binding partners embedded in lipid bilayers of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Nelfinavir affected the fluidity and composition of lipid-rich membranes, disrupted mitochondrial respiration, blocked vesicular transport, and affected the function of membrane-embedded drug efflux transporter ABCB1, triggering the integrated stress response. Sensitivity to nelfinavir was dependent on ADIPOR2, which maintains membrane fluidity by promoting fatty acid desaturation and incorporation into phospholipids. Supplementation with fatty acids prevented the nelfinavir-induced effect on mitochondrial metabolism, drug-efflux transporters, and stress-response activation. Conversely, depletion of fatty acids/cholesterol pools by the FDA-approved drug ezetimibe showed a synergistic anticancer activity with nelfinavir in vitro. These results identify the modification of lipid-rich membranes by nelfinavir as a novel mechanism of action to achieve broad anticancer activity, which may be suitable for the treatment of PI-refractory multiple myeloma. SIGNIFICANCE: Nelfinavir induces lipid bilayer stress in cellular organelles that disrupts mitochondrial respiration and transmembrane protein transport, resulting in broad anticancer activity via metabolic rewiring and activation of the unfolded protein response.
PXD026091	34158670	A multi-omics investigation of the composition and function of extracellular vesicles along the temporal trajectory of COVID-19. 	COVID-19 patient plasma exosome proteomics	COVID-19, Covid-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, exosome, plasma	Exosomes represent a subtype of extracellular vesicle that is released through retrograde transport and fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane(1). Although no perfect methodologies currently exist for the high-throughput, unbiased isolation of pure plasma exosomes(2,3), investigation of exosome-enriched plasma fractions of extracellular vesicles can confer a glimpse into the endocytic pathway on a systems level. Here we conduct high-coverage lipidomics with an emphasis on sterols and oxysterols, and proteomic analyses of exosome-enriched extracellular vesicles (EVs hereafter) from patients at different temporal stages of COVID-19, including the presymptomatic, hyperinflammatory, resolution and convalescent phases. Our study highlights dysregulated raft lipid metabolism that underlies changes in EV lipid membrane anisotropy that alter the exosomal localization of presenilin-1 (PS-1) in the hyperinflammatory phase. We also show in vitro that EVs from different temporal phases trigger distinct metabolic and transcriptional responses in recipient cells, including in alveolar epithelial cells, which denote the primary site of infection, and liver hepatocytes, which represent a distal secondary site. In comparison to the hyperinflammatory phase, EVs from the resolution phase induce opposing effects on eukaryotic translation and Notch signalling. Our results provide insights into cellular lipid metabolism and inter-tissue crosstalk at different stages of COVID-19 and are a resource to increase our understanding of metabolic dysregulation in COVID-19.
PXD022350	34159634	Surface AMP deaminase 2 as a novel regulator modifying extracellular adenine nucleotide metabolism. 	Surface AMP Deaminase 2 as a Novel Regulator Modifying Extracellular Adenine Nucleotide Metabolism	Epithelial Cells, Monocytes	Adenine nucleotides represent crucial immunomodulators in the extracellular environment. The ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 are responsible for the sequential catabolism of ATP to adenosine via AMP, thus promoting an anti-inflammatory milieu induced by the "adenosine halo". AMPD2 intracellularly mediates AMP deamination to IMP, thereby both enhancing the degradation of inflammatory ATP and reducing the formation of anti-inflammatory adenosine. Here, we show that this enzyme is expressed on the surface of human immune cells and its predominance may modify inflammatory states by altering the extracellular milieu. Surface AMPD2 (eAMPD2) expression on monocytes was verified by immunoblot, surface biotinylation, mass spectrometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Flow cytometry revealed enhanced monocytic eAMPD2 expression after TLR stimulation. PBMCs from patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed significantly higher levels of eAMPD2 expression compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, the product of AMPD2-IMP-exerted anti-inflammatory effects, while the levels of extracellular adenosine were not impaired by an increased eAMPD2 expression. In summary, our study identifies eAMPD2 as a novel regulator of the extracellular ATP-adenosine balance adding to the immunomodulatory CD39-CD73 system.
PXD024563	34161757	Structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana glutamate receptor-like channel GLR3.4. 	Structure and Function of GLR3.4		Glutamate receptor-like channels (GLRs) play vital roles in various physiological processes in plants, such as wound response, stomatal aperture control, seed germination, root development, innate immune response, pollen tube growth, and morphogenesis. Despite the importance of GLRs, knowledge about their molecular organization is limited. Here we use X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-EM to solve structures of the Arabidopsis thaliana GLR3.4. Our structures reveal the tetrameric assembly of GLR3.4 subunits into a three-layer domain architecture, reminiscent of animal ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). However, the non-swapped arrangement between layers of GLR3.4 domains, binding of glutathione through S-glutathionylation of cysteine C205 inside the amino-terminal domain clamshell, unique symmetry, inter-domain interfaces, and ligand specificity distinguish GLR3.4 from representatives of the iGluR family and suggest distinct features of the GLR gating mechanism. Our work elaborates on the principles of GLR architecture and symmetry and provides a molecular template for deciphering GLR-dependent signaling mechanisms in plants.
PXD025803	34162877	Human cytomegalovirus-induced host protein citrullination is crucial for viral replication. 	Human cytomegalovirus-induced host protein citrullination is crucial for viral replication	HCMV, IFIT1, citrullination	Citrullination is the conversion of arginine-to-citrulline by protein arginine deiminases (PADs), whose dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of various types of cancers and autoimmune diseases. Consistent with the ability of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) to induce post-translational modifications of cellular proteins to gain a survival advantage, we show that HCMV infection of primary human fibroblasts triggers PAD-mediated citrullination of several host proteins, and that this activity promotes viral fitness. Citrullinome analysis reveals significant changes in deimination levels of both cellular and viral proteins, with interferon (IFN)-inducible protein IFIT1 being among the most heavily deiminated one. As genetic depletion of IFIT1 strongly enhances HCMV growth, and in vitro IFIT1 citrullination impairs its ability to bind to 5'-ppp-RNA, we propose that viral-induced IFIT1 citrullination is a mechanism of HCMV evasion from host antiviral resistance. Overall, our findings point to a crucial role of citrullination in subverting cellular responses to viral infection.
PXD023548	34163069	Phase separation drives aberrant chromatin looping and cancer development. 	A phase separation mechanism underlies development of cancer and aberrant organization of three-dimensional chromatin structure	BioID, homeodomain-containing transcription factor, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), oncogenesis	The development of cancer is intimately associated with genetic abnormalities that target proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). In human haematological malignancies, recurrent chromosomal translocation of nucleoporin (NUP98 or NUP214) generates an aberrant chimera that invariably retains the nucleoporin IDR-tandemly dispersed repeats of phenylalanine and glycine residues(1,2). However, how unstructured IDRs contribute to oncogenesis remains unclear. Here we show that IDRs contained within NUP98-HOXA9, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor chimera recurrently detected in leukaemias(1,2), are essential for establishing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) puncta of chimera and for inducing leukaemic transformation. Notably, LLPS of NUP98-HOXA9 not only promotes chromatin occupancy of chimera transcription factors, but also is required for the formation of a broad 'super-enhancer'-like binding pattern typically seen at leukaemogenic genes, which potentiates transcriptional activation. An artificial HOX chimera, created by replacing the phenylalanine and glycine repeats of NUP98 with an unrelated LLPS-forming IDR of the FUS protein(3,4), had similar enhancing effects on the genome-wide binding and target gene activation of the chimera. Deeply sequenced Hi-C revealed that phase-separated NUP98-HOXA9 induces CTCF-independent chromatin loops that are enriched at proto-oncogenes. Together, this report describes a proof-of-principle example in which cancer acquires mutation to establish oncogenic transcription factor condensates via phase separation, which simultaneously enhances their genomic targeting and induces organization of aberrant three-dimensional chromatin structure during tumourous transformation. As LLPS-competent molecules are frequently implicated in diseases(1,2,4-7), this mechanism can potentially be generalized to many malignant and pathological settings.
PXD022031	34163479	Evaluation and Differential Diagnosis of a Genetic Marked Brucella Vaccine A19DeltavirB12 for Cattle. 	Comparative Proteomics between Brucella abortus 2308 and Genetically Marked Vaccine A19Î”virB12 Reveal Attenuation Mechanism and Supplementary Differential Diagnosis Antigens	A19Î”virB12, Attenuation mechanism, B. abortus, Differential diagnosis	Brucella abortus is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes severe economic loss to husbandry and poses a threat to human health. The B. abortus A19 live vaccine has been extensively used to prevent bovine brucellosis in China. However, it is difficult to distinguish the serological response induced by A19 from that induced by natural infection. In this study, a novel genetically marked vaccine, A19DeltavirB12, was generated and evaluated. The results indicated that A19DeltavirB12 was able to provide effective protection against B. abortus 2308 (S2308) challenge in mice. Furthermore, the safety and protective efficacy of A19DeltavirB12 have been confirmed in natural host cattle. Additionally, the VirB12 protein allowed for serological differentiation between the S2308 challenge/natural infection and A19DeltavirB12 vaccination. However, previous studies have found that the accuracy of the serological detection based on VirB12 needs to be improved. Therefore, we attempted to identify potential supplementary antigens with differential diagnostic functions by combining label-free quantitative proteomics and protein chip technology. Twenty-six proteins identified only in S2308 were screened; among them, five proteins were considered as potential supplementary antigens. Thus, the accuracy of the differential diagnosis between A19DeltavirB12 immunization and field infection may be improved through multi-antigen detection. In addition, we explored the possible attenuation factors of Brucella vaccine strain. Nine virulence factors were downregulated in A19DeltavirB12. The downregulation pathways of A19DeltavirB12 were significantly enriched in quorum sensing, ATP-binding cassette transporter, and metabolism. Several proteins related to cell division were significantly downregulated, while some proteins involved in transcription were upregulated in S2308. In conclusion, our results contribute to the control and eradication of brucellosis and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the attenuation of A19DeltavirB12.
PXD023640	34165673	Combined transcriptome and proteome analysis provides insights into anthocyanin accumulation in the leaves of red-leaved poplars. 	Proteome analysis of leaves between red-leaved poplar cultivars (â€˜Quanhong' and â€˜Xuanhong') and â€˜Zhonglin 2025' (Populus deltoides cv. â€˜Zhonglin 2025').	Red-leaved poplar	KEY MESSAGE: Anthocyanin was highly accumulated in the leaves of red-leaved poplars; Many structural genes involved in anthocyanin synthesis were significantly up-regulated in 'Quanhong' and 'Xuanhong'; TTG2, HYH, and HY5 may be directly involved in the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis in both red-leaved poplars. The red-leaved poplar cultivars 'Quanhong' and 'Xuanhong' are bud mutations of Populus deltoides cv. 'Zhonglin 2025'. These cultivars are valued for their beautiful shape, lack of flying catkins, and ornamental leaf colors. However, the understanding of the molecular mechanism of anthocyanin accumulation in the leaves of red-leaved poplars is still unclear. Here, we profiled the changes of pigment content, transcriptome and proteome expression in the leaves of three poplar cultivars and the results showed that the ratios of anthocyanin to total chlorophyll in both red-leaved poplars were higher than that in 'Zhonglin 2025', indicating that the anthocyanin was highly accumulated in the leaves of red-leaved poplars. Based on the results of combined transcriptome and proteome analysis, 15 and 11 differentially expressed genes/proteins involved in anthocyanin synthesis were screened in 'Quanhong' and 'Xuanhong', respectively, indicating that the two red-leaved poplar cultivars have slightly different patterns of regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. Among the 120 transcription factors, 3 (HY5, HYH, and TTG2), may be directly involved in the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis in both red-leaved poplars. This study screens the candidate genes involved in anthocyanin accumulation in the leaves of red-leaved poplars and lays a foundation for further exploring the molecular mechanism of leaf red coloration in red-leaved poplars.
PXD021929	34166401	Antagonistic fungal enterotoxins intersect at multiple levels with host innate immune defences. 	Fungus-host protein-protein interactions between Drechmeria coniospora and Caenorhabditis elegans	AP-MS, C. elegans, Drechmeria coniospora, Fungus-host interaction, PPI, innate immunity	Animals and plants need to defend themselves from pathogen attack. Their defences drive innovation in virulence mechanisms, leading to never-ending cycles of co-evolution in both hosts and pathogens. A full understanding of host immunity therefore requires examination of pathogen virulence strategies. Here, we take advantage of the well-studied innate immune system of Caenorhabditis elegans to dissect the action of two virulence factors from its natural fungal pathogen Drechmeria coniospora. We show that these two enterotoxins have strikingly different effects when expressed individually in the nematode epidermis. One is able to interfere with diverse aspects of host cell biology, altering vesicle trafficking and preventing the key STAT-like transcription factor STA-2 from activating defensive antimicrobial peptide gene expression. The second increases STA-2 levels in the nucleus, modifies the nucleolus, and, potentially as a consequence of a host surveillance mechanism, causes increased defence gene expression. Our results highlight the remarkably complex and potentially antagonistic mechanisms that come into play in the interaction between co-evolved hosts and pathogens.
PXD018641	34166609	Nascent RNA antagonizes the interaction of a set of regulatory proteins with chromatin. 	Nascent RNA antagonises the interaction of regulatory proteins with chromatin	Mouse Chromatin Chromatome LC-MSMS	A number of regulatory factors are recruited to chromatin by specialized RNAs. Whether RNA has a more general role in regulating the interaction of proteins with chromatin has not been determined. We used proteomics methods to measure the global impact of nascent RNA on chromatin in embryonic stem cells. Surprisingly, we found that nascent RNA primarily antagonized the interaction of chromatin modifiers and transcriptional regulators with chromatin. Transcriptional inhibition and RNA degradation induced recruitment of a set of transcriptional regulators, chromatin modifiers, nucleosome remodelers, and regulators of higher-order structure. RNA directly bound to factors, including BAF, NuRD, EHMT1, and INO80 and inhibited their interaction with nucleosomes. The transcriptional elongation factor P-TEFb directly bound pre-mRNA, and its recruitment to chromatin upon Pol II inhibition was regulated by the 7SK ribonucleoprotein complex. We postulate that by antagonizing the interaction of regulatory proteins with chromatin, nascent RNA links transcriptional output with chromatin composition.
PXD025499	34166618	Identification of presented SARS-CoV-2 HLA class I and HLA class II peptides using HLA peptidomics. 	The landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 HLA-peptidome	HLA-peptidomics, SARS-CoV-2, immunopeptidomics	The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-bound viral antigens serve as an immunological signature that can be selectively recognized by T cells. As viruses evolve by acquiring mutations, it is essential to identify a range of presented viral antigens. Using HLA peptidomics, we are able to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-derived peptides presented by highly prevalent HLA class I (HLA-I) molecules by using infected cells as well as overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 genes. We find 26 HLA-I peptides and 36 HLA class II (HLA-II) peptides. Among the identified peptides, some are shared between different cells and some are derived from out-of-frame open reading frames (ORFs). Seven of these peptides were previously shown to be immunogenic, and we identify two additional immunoreactive peptides by using HLA multimer staining. These results may aid the development of the next generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on presented viral-specific antigens that span several of the viral genes.
PXD026194	34168165	Venom duct origins of prey capture and defensive conotoxins in piscivorous Conus striatus. 	Conus striatus Venom Duct LC/MS/MS	Conus striatus, Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Reduced alkylated, TripleTOF 5600, trypsin digested	The venom duct origins of predatory and defensive venoms has not been studied for hook-and-line fish hunting cone snails despite the pharmacological importance of their venoms. To better understand the biochemistry and evolution of injected predatory and defensive venoms, we compared distal, central and proximal venom duct sections across three specimens of C. striatus (Pionoconus) using proteomic and transcriptomic approaches. A total of 370 conotoxin precursors were identified from the whole venom duct transcriptome. Milked defensive venom was enriched with a potent cocktail of proximally expressed inhibitory alpha-, omega- and mu-conotoxins compared to milked predatory venom. In contrast, excitatory kappaA-conotoxins dominated both the predatory and defensive venoms despite their distal expression, suggesting this class of conotoxin can be selectively expressed from the same duct segment in response to either a predatory or defensive stimuli. Given the high abundance of kappaA-conotoxins in the Pionoconus clade, we hypothesise that the kappaA-conotoxins have evolved through adaptive evolution following their repurposing from ancestral inhibitory A superfamily conotoxins to facilitate the dietary shift to fish hunting and species radiation in this clade.
PXD026218	34168208	Exoproteomic analysis of two MLST clade 2 strains of Clostridioides difficile from Latin America reveal close similarities. 	Exoproteomic analysis of two MLST clade 2 strains of Clostridioides difficile from Latin America	Clostridioides difficile, Latin America, rybotype	Clostridioides difficile BI/NAP1/ribotype 027 is an epidemic hypervirulent strain found worldwide, including in Latin America. We examined the genomes and exoproteomes of two multilocus sequence type (MLST) clade 2 C. difficile strains considered hypervirulent: ICC-45 (ribotype SLO231/UK[CE]821), isolated in Brazil, and NAP1/027/ST01 (LIBA5756), isolated during a 2010 outbreak in Costa Rica. C. difficile isolates were cultured and extracellular proteins were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Genomic analysis revealed that these isolates shared most of the gene composition. Only 83 and 290 NAP1/027 genes were considered singletons in ICC-45 and NAP1/027, respectively. Exoproteome analysis revealed 197 proteins, of which 192 were similar in both strains. Only five proteins were exclusive to the ICC-45 strain. These proteins were involved with catalytic and binding functions and indirectly interacted with proteins related to pathogenicity. Most proteins, including TcdA, TcdB, flagellin subunit, and cell surface protein, were overrepresented in the ICC-45 strain; 14 proteins, including mature S-layer protein, were present in higher proportions in LIBA5756. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026218. These data show close similarity between the genome and proteins in the supernatant of two strains with hypervirulent features isolated in Latin America and underscore the importance of epidemiological surveillance of the transmission and emergence of new strains.
PXD023069	34168259	Integrated lipidomics and proteomics reveal cardiolipin alterations, upregulation of HADHA and long chain fatty acids in pancreatic cancer stem cells. 	Integrated lipidomics and proteomics reveal cardiolipin remodelling by upregulation of HADHA and indirectly by ELOVL5 in pancreatic cancer stem cells	PCSCs, PDAC	Pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs) play a key role in the aggressiveness of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC); however, little is known about their signaling and metabolic pathways. Here we show that PCSCs have specific and common proteome and lipidome modulations. PCSCs displayed downregulation of lactate dehydrogenase A chain, and upregulation of trifunctional enzyme subunit alpha. The upregulated proteins of PCSCs are mainly involved in fatty acid (FA) elongation and biosynthesis of unsaturated FAs. Accordingly, lipidomics reveals an increase in long and very long-chain unsaturated FAs, which are products of fatty acid elongase-5 predicted as a key gene. Moreover, lipidomics showed the induction in PCSCs of molecular species of cardiolipin with mixed incorporation of 16:0, 18:1, and 18:2 acyl chains. Our data indicate a crucial role of FA elongation and alteration in cardiolipin acyl chain composition in PCSCs, representing attractive therapeutic targets in PDAC.
PXD024843	34168639	Proteomics Analysis Reveals Bacterial Antibiotics Resistance Mechanism Mediated by ahslyA Against Enoxacin in Aeromonas hydrophila. 	Proteomics analysis reveals bacterial antibiotics resistance mechanism mediated by ahslyA against enoxacin in Aeromonas hydrophila	Aeromonas hydrophila, ahslyA	Bacterial antibiotic resistance is a serious global problem; the underlying regulatory mechanisms are largely elusive. The earlier reports states that the vital role of transcriptional regulators (TRs) in bacterial antibiotic resistance. Therefore, we have investigated the role of TRs on enoxacin (ENX) resistance in Aeromonas hydrophila in this study. A label-free quantitative proteomics method was utilized to compare the protein profiles of the ahslyA knockout and wild-type A. hydrophila strains under ENX stress. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the deletion of ahslyA triggers the up-regulated expression of some vital antibiotic resistance proteins in A. hydrophila upon ENX stress and thereby reduce the pressure by preventing the activation of SOS repair system. Moreover, ahslyA directly or indirectly induced at least 11 TRs, which indicates a complicated regulatory network under ENX stress. We also deleted six selected genes in A. hydrophila that altered in proteomics data in order to evaluate their roles in ENX stress. Our results showed that genes such as AHA_0655, narQ, AHA_3721, AHA_2114, and AHA_1239 are regulated by ahslyA and may be involved in ENX resistance. Overall, our data demonstrated the important role of ahslyA in ENX resistance and provided novel insights into the effects of transcriptional regulation on antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
PXD022470	34168754	A tailored phosphoaspartate probe unravels CprR as a response regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa interkingdom signaling. 	A tailored phosphoaspartate probe unravels CprR as a response regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa interkingdom signaling	Activity-based protein profiling, P. aeruginosa, adaptive resistance, antimicrobial peptide, isotopically labeled tags, parallel reaction monitoring, phosphorylation, response regulator	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a difficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacterial pathogen causing life-threatening infections. Adaptive resistance (AR) to cationic peptide antibiotics such as polymyxin B impairs the therapeutic success. This self-protection is mediated by two component systems (TCSs) consisting of a membrane-bound histidine kinase and an intracellular response regulator (RR). As phosphorylation of the key RR aspartate residue is transient during signaling and hydrolytically unstable, the study of these systems is challenging. Here, we apply a tailored reverse polarity chemical proteomic strategy to capture this transient modification and read-out RR phosphorylation in complex proteomes using a nucleophilic probe. In-depth mechanistic insights into an ideal trapping strategy were performed with a recombinant RR demonstrating the importance of fine-tuned acidic pH values to facilitate the attack on the aspartate carbonyl C-atom and prevent unproductive hydrolysis. Analysis of Bacillus subtilis and P. aeruginosa proteomes revealed the detection of multiple annotated phosphoaspartate (pAsp) sites of known RRs in addition to many new potential pAsp sites. With this validated strategy we dissected the signaling of dynorphin A, a human peptide stress hormone, which is sensed by P. aeruginosa to prepare AR. Intriguingly, our methodology identified CprR as an unprecedented RR in dynorphin A interkingdom signaling.
PXD023881	34169315	Coordinated pyruvate kinase activity is crucial for metabolic adaptation and cell survival during mitochondrial dysfunction. 	Pyruvate kinase supports the metabolic shift and long-term survival of a mouse model with mitochondrial dysfunction caused by DGUOK deficiency	DGUOK deficiency, Label-free quantification, TMT-based quantification	Deoxyguanosine kinase (DGUOK) deficiency causes mtDNA depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction. We reported long survival of DGUOK knockout (Dguok-/-) mice despite low (<5%) mtDNA content in liver tissue. However, the molecular mechanisms enabling the extended survival remain unknown. Using transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics followed by in vitro assays, we aimed to identify the molecular pathways involved in the extended survival of the Dguok-/- mice. At the early stage, the serine synthesis and folate cycle were activated but declined later. Increased activity of the mitochondrial citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) and the urea cycle and degradation of branched chain amino acids were hallmarks of the extended lifespan in DGUOK deficiency. Furthermore, the increased synthesis of TCA cycle intermediates was supported by coordination of two pyruvate kinase genes, PKLR and PKM, indicating a central coordinating role of pyruvate kinases to support the long-term survival in mitochondrial dysfunction.
PXD026566	34170117	Wide-Ranging Effects on the Brain Proteome in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease Following Treatment with a Brain-Targeting Somatostatin Peptide. 	Brain proteome analysis of APPswe mouse model at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease pathology	Alzheimers disease, LC-MS, brain, mice, tryptic digestion	Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the pathological aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. A potential therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease is to enhance Abeta degradation by increasing the activity of Abeta-degrading enzymes, including neprilysin. The somatostatin (SST) peptide has been identified as an activator of neprilysin. Recently, we demonstrated the ability of a brain-penetrating SST peptide (SST-scFv8D3) to increase neprilysin activity and membrane-bound Abeta42 degradation in the hippocampus of mice overexpressing the Abeta-precursor protein with the Swedish mutation (APPswe). Using LC-MS, we further evaluated the anti-Alzheimer's disease effects of SST-scFv8D3. Following a triple intravenous injection of SST-scFv8D3, the LC-MS analysis of the brain proteome revealed that the majority of downregulated proteins consisted of mitochondrial proteins regulating fatty acid oxidation, which are otherwise upregulated in APPswe mice compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, treatment with SST-scFv8D3 significantly increased hippocampal levels of synaptic proteins regulating cell membrane trafficking and neuronal development. Finally, hippocampal concentrations of growth-regulated alpha (KC/GRO) chemokine and degradation of neuropeptide-Y were elevated after SST-scFv8D3 treatment. In summary, our results demonstrate a multifaceted effect profile in regulating mitochondrial function and neurogenesis following treatment with SST-scFv8D3, further suggesting the development of Alzheimer's disease therapies based on SST peptides.
PXD018838	34170319	Expanding the phenotype of NUP85 mutations beyond nephrotic syndrome to primary autosomal recessive microcephaly and Seckel syndrome spectrum disorders. 	Expanding the phenotype of NUP85 mutations beyond nephrotic syndrome to Primary autosomal recessive microcephaly and Seckel syndrome spectrum disoders	NUP85, primary fibroblasts	Primary autosomal recessive microcephaly and Seckel syndrome spectrum disorders (MCPH-SCKS) include a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive inherited diseases characterized by primary (congenital) microcephaly, the absence of visceral abnormalities, and a variable degree of cognitive impairment, short stature and facial dysmorphism. Recently, biallelic variants in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) component nucleoporin 85 gene (NUP85) were reported to cause steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). Here, we report biallelic variants in NUP85 in two pedigrees with an MCPH-SCKS phenotype spectrum without SRNS, thereby expanding the phenotypic spectrum of NUP85-linked diseases. Structural analysis predicts the identified NUP85 variants cause conformational changes that could have an effect on NPC architecture or on its interaction with other NUPs. We show that mutant NUP85 is, however, associated with a reduced number of NPCs but unaltered nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization, abnormal mitotic spindle morphology, and decreased cell viability and proliferation in one patient's cells. Our results also indicate the link of common cellular mechanisms involved in MCPH-SCKS spectrum disorders and NUP85-associated diseases. In addition to the previous studies, our results broaden the phenotypic spectrum of NUP85-linked human disease and propose a role for NUP85 in nervous system development.
PXD024724	34172091	A proteomic network approach resolves stage-specific molecular phenotypes in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. 	A proteomic network approach resolves stage-specific molecular phenotypes in chronic traumatic encephalopathy	CTE, TMT, WGCNA	BACKGROUND: There is an association between repetitive head injury (RHI) and a pathologic diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) characterized by the aggregation of proteins including tau. The underlying molecular events that cause these abnormal protein accumulations remain unclear. Here, we hypothesized that identifying the human brain proteome from serial CTE stages (CTE I-IV) would provide critical new insights into CTE pathogenesis. Brain samples from frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to microtubule associated protein tau (FTLD-MAPT) mutations were also included as a distinct tauopathy phenotype for comparison. METHODS: Isobaric tandem mass tagged labeling and mass spectrometry (TMT-MS) followed by integrated differential and co-expression analysis (i.e., weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)) was used to define modules of highly correlated proteins associated with clinical and pathological phenotypes in control (n = 23), CTE (n = 43), and FTLD-MAPT (n = 12) post-mortem cortical tissues. We also compared these findings to network analysis of AD brain. RESULTS: We identified over 6000 unique proteins across all four CTE stages which sorted into 28 WGCNA modules. Consistent with Alzheimer's disease, specific modules demonstrated reduced neuronal protein levels, suggesting a neurodegeneration phenotype, while other modules were increased, including proteins associated with inflammation and glial cell proliferation. Notably, unique CTE-specific modules demonstrated prominent enrichment of immunoglobulins, including IGHM and IGLL5, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as well as progressive protein changes with increasing CTE pathologic stage. Finally, aggregate cell subtype (i.e., neurons, microglia, astrocytes) protein abundance levels in CTE cases were similar in expression to AD, but at intermediate levels between controls and the more exaggerated phenotype of FTLD-MAPT, especially in astrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we identified thousands of protein changes in CTE postmortem brain and demonstrated that CTE has a pattern of neurodegeneration in neuronal-synaptic and inflammation modules similar to AD. We also identified unique CTE progressive changes, including the enrichment of immunoglobulins and ECM proteins even in early CTE stages. Early and sustained changes in astrocyte modules were also observed. Overall, the prominent overlap with FTLD-MAPT cases confirmed that CTE is on the tauopathy continuum and identified CTE stage specific molecular phenotypes that provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis.
PXD014488	34172716	TNF-alpha induces endothelial-mesenchymal transition promoting stromal development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 	Differential protein secretome induced by TNF-alpha	LC-MS, Secretome, TNFalpha, cancer, endothelial cell, mesenchymal cell	Endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is an important source of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which facilitates tumour progression. PDAC is characterised by abundant CAFs and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Here, we show that TNF-alpha strongly induces human endothelial cells to undergo EndMT. Interestingly, TNF-alpha strongly downregulates the expression of the endothelial receptor TIE1, and reciprocally TIE1 overexpression partially prevents TNF-alpha-induced EndMT, suggesting that TNF-alpha acts, at least partially, through TIE1 regulation in this process. We also show that TNF-alpha-induced EndMT is reversible. Furthermore, TNF-alpha treatment of orthotopic mice resulted in an important increase in the stroma, including CAFs. Finally, secretome analysis identified TNFSF12, as a regulator that is also present in PDAC patients. With the aim of restoring normal angiogenesis and better access to drugs, our results support the development of therapies targeting CAFs or inducing the EndMT reversion process in PDAC.
PXD024747	34172724	SMG5-SMG7 authorize nonsense-mediated mRNA decay by enabling SMG6 endonucleolytic activity. 	Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay relies on "two-factor authentication" by SMG5-SMG7	Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, SMG5-SMG7, SMG6, UPF1, gene expression, mRNA degradation	Eukaryotic gene expression is constantly controlled by the translation-coupled nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. Aberrant translation termination leads to NMD activation, resulting in phosphorylation of the central NMD factor UPF1 and robust clearance of NMD targets via two seemingly independent and redundant mRNA degradation branches. Here, we uncover that the loss of the first SMG5-SMG7-dependent pathway also inactivates the second SMG6-dependent branch, indicating an unexpected functional connection between the final NMD steps. Transcriptome-wide analyses of SMG5-SMG7-depleted cells confirm exhaustive NMD inhibition resulting in massive transcriptomic alterations. Intriguingly, we find that the functionally underestimated SMG5 can substitute the role of SMG7 and individually activate NMD. Furthermore, the presence of either SMG5 or SMG7 is sufficient to support SMG6-mediated endonucleolysis of NMD targets. Our data support an improved model for NMD execution that features two-factor authentication involving UPF1 phosphorylation and SMG5-SMG7 recruitment to access SMG6 activity.
PXD022420	34172766	The highly conserved FOXJ1 target CFAP161 is dispensable for motile ciliary function in mouse and Xenopus. 	CFAP161 interactome from mouse testis	Cfap206, mouse testis	Cilia are protrusions of the cell surface and composed of hundreds of proteins many of which are evolutionary and functionally well conserved. In cells assembling motile cilia the expression of numerous ciliary components is under the control of the transcription factor FOXJ1. Here, we analyse the evolutionary conserved FOXJ1 target CFAP161 in Xenopus and mouse. In both species Cfap161 expression correlates with the presence of motile cilia and depends on FOXJ1. Tagged CFAP161 localises to the basal bodies of multiciliated cells of the Xenopus larval epidermis, and in mice CFAP161 protein localises to the axoneme. Surprisingly, disruption of the Cfap161 gene in both species did not lead to motile cilia-related phenotypes, which contrasts with the conserved expression in cells carrying motile cilia and high sequence conservation. In mice mutation of Cfap161 stabilised the mutant mRNA making genetic compensation triggered by mRNA decay unlikely. However, genes related to microtubules and cilia, microtubule motor activity and inner dyneins were dysregulated, which might buffer the Cfap161 mutation.
PXD025850	34172817	Reduced C9orf72 function leads to defective synaptic vesicle release and neuromuscular dysfunction in zebrafish. 	Proteomics analysis zebrafish ALS model	larvae, zebrafish	The most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion within the C9orf72 gene. Reduced levels of C9orf72 mRNA and protein have been found in ALS/FTD patients, but the role of this protein in disease pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Here, we report the generation and characterization of a stable C9orf72 loss-of-function (LOF) model in the zebrafish. We show that reduced C9orf72 function leads to motor defects, muscle atrophy, motor neuron loss and mortality in early larval and adult stages. Analysis of the structure and function of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of the larvae, reveal a marked reduction in the number of presynaptic and postsynaptic structures and an impaired release of quantal synaptic vesicles at the NMJ. Strikingly, we demonstrate a downregulation of SV2a upon C9orf72-LOF and a reduced rate of synaptic vesicle cycling. Furthermore, we show a reduced number and size of Rab3a-postive synaptic puncta at NMJs. Altogether, these results reveal a key function for C9orf72 in the control of presynaptic vesicle trafficking and release at the zebrafish larval NMJ. Our study demonstrates an important role for C9orf72 in ALS/FTD pathogenesis, where it regulates synaptic vesicle release and neuromuscular functions.
PXD025711	34172827	p38-MAPK-mediated translation regulation during early blastocyst development is required for primitive endoderm differentiation in mice. 	p38-MAPK mediated rRNA processing and translation regulation enables PrE differentiation during mouse blastocyst maturation	p38-MAPK, phosphoproteomics	Successful specification of the two mouse blastocyst inner cell mass (ICM) lineages (the primitive endoderm (PrE) and epiblast) is a prerequisite for continued development and requires active fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) signaling. Previously, we identified a role for p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38-MAPKs) during PrE differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unresolved. Here, we report an early blastocyst window of p38-MAPK activity that is required to regulate ribosome-related gene expression, rRNA precursor processing, polysome formation and protein translation. We show that p38-MAPK inhibition-induced PrE phenotypes can be partially rescued by activating the translational regulator mTOR. However, similar PrE phenotypes associated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibition targeting active FGF4 signaling are not affected by mTOR activation. These data indicate a specific role for p38-MAPKs in providing a permissive translational environment during mouse blastocyst PrE differentiation that is distinct from classically reported FGF4-based mechanisms.
PXD025743	34174286	Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) small-molecule inhibitor binding increases stability and intracellular levels of VHL protein. 	VHL inhibitor binding increases intracellular level of VHL	HeLa, Human cells, TMT-labelling	Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by frequent mutation of VHL protein, a tumor suppressor that functions as the substrate recognition subunit of a Cullin2 RING E3 ligase complex (CRL2(VHL)). CRL2(VHL) plays important roles in oxygen sensing by targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-alpha) subunits for ubiquitination and degradation. VHL is also commonly hijacked by bifunctional molecules such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras to induce degradation of target molecules. We previously reported the design and characterization of VHL inhibitors VH032 and VH298 that block the VHL:HIF-alpha interaction, activate the HIF transcription factor, and induce a hypoxic response, which can be beneficial to treat anemia and mitochondrial diseases. How these compounds affect the global cellular proteome remains unknown. Here, we use unbiased quantitative MS to identify the proteomic changes elicited by the VHL inhibitor compared with hypoxia or the broad-spectrum prolyl-hydroxylase domain enzyme inhibitor IOX2. Our results demonstrate that VHL inhibitors selectively activate the HIF response similar to the changes induced in hypoxia and IOX2 treatment. Interestingly, VHL inhibitors were found to specifically upregulate VHL itself. Our analysis revealed that this occurs via protein stabilization of VHL isoforms and not via changes in transcript levels. Increased VHL levels upon VH298 treatment resulted in turn in reduced levels of HIF-1alpha protein. This work demonstrates the specificity of VHL inhibitors and reveals different antagonistic effects upon their acute versus prolonged treatment in cells. These findings suggest that therapeutic use of VHL inhibitors may not produce overt side effects from HIF stabilization as previously thought.
PXD023223	34174307	The effects of Naja sumatrana venom cytotoxin, sumaCTX on alteration of the secretome in MCF-7 breast cancer cells following membrane permeabilization. 	The label-free quantitative secretome of MCF-7 cells treated with sumaCTX	LFQ, necroptosis, sumaCTX	Naja sumatrana venom cytotoxin (sumaCTX) is a basic protein which belongs to three-finger toxin family. It has been shown to induce caspase-dependent, mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 cells at lower concentrations. This study aimed to investigate the alteration of secretome in MCF-7 cells following membrane permeabilization by high concentrations of sumaCTX, using label-free quantitative (LFQ) approach. The degree of membrane permeabilization of sumaCTX was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and calcein-propidium iodide (PI) assays. LDH and calcein-PI assays revealed time-dependent membrane permeabilization within a narrow concentration range. However, as toxin concentrations increased, prolonged exposure of MCF-7 cells to sumaCTX did not promote the progression of membrane permeabilization. The secretome analyses showed that membrane permeabilization was an event preceding the release of intracellular proteins. Bioinformatics analyses of the LFQ secretome revealed the presence of 105 significantly distinguished proteins involved in metabolism, structural supports, inflammatory responses, and necroptosis in MCF-7 cells treated with 29.8 mug/mL of sumaCTX. Necroptosis was presumably an initial stress response in MCF-7 cells when exposed to high sumaCTX concentration. Collectively, sumaCTX-induced the loss of membrane integrity in a concentration-dependent manner, whereby the cell death pattern of MCF-7 cells transformed from apoptosis to necroptosis with increasing toxin concentrations.
PXD022114	34174811	Buffalo sperm surface proteome profiling reveals an intricate relationship between innate immunity and reproduction. 	Tandem mass spectrometry of buffalo sperm-surface extracted proteins	beta-defensin, buffalo, sperm	BACKGROUND: Low conception rate (CR) despite insemination with morphologically normal spermatozoa is a common reproductive restraint that limits buffalo productivity. This accounts for a significant loss to the farmers and the dairy industry, especially in agriculture-based economies. The immune-related proteins on the sperm surface are known to regulate fertility by assisting the spermatozoa in their survival and performance in the female reproductive tract (FRT). Regardless of their importance, very few studies have specifically catalogued the buffalo sperm surface proteome. The study was designed to determine the identity of sperm surface proteins and to ascertain if the epididymal expressed beta-defensins (BDs), implicated in male fertility, are translated and applied onto buffalo sperm surface along with other immune-related proteins. RESULTS: The raw mass spectra data searched against an in-house generated proteome database from UniProt using Comet search engine identified more than 300 proteins on the ejaculated buffalo sperm surface which were bound either by non-covalent (ionic) interactions or by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The singular enrichment analysis (SEA) revealed that most of these proteins were extracellular with varied binding activities and were involved in either immune or reproductive processes. Flow cytometry using six FITC-labelled lectins confirmed the prediction of glycosylation of these proteins. Several beta-defensins (BDs), the anti-microbial peptides including the BuBD-129 and 126 were also identified amongst other buffalo sperm surface proteins. The presence of these proteins was subsequently confirmed by RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence and in vitro fertilization (IVF) experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The surface of the buffalo spermatozoa is heavily glycosylated because of the epididymal secreted (glyco) proteins like BDs and the GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs). The glycosylation pattern of buffalo sperm-surface, however, could be perturbed in the presence of elevated salt concentration or incubation with PI-PLC. The identification of numerous BDs on the sperm surface strengthens our hypothesis that the buffalo BDs (BuBDs) assist the spermatozoa either in their survival or in performance in the FRT. Our results suggest that BuBD-129 is a sperm-surface BD that could have a role in buffalo sperm function. Further studies elucidating its exact physiological function are required to better understand its role in the regulation of male fertility.
PXD021318	34174878	Multi-omics analyses of human colorectal cancer revealed three mitochondrial genes potentially associated with poor outcomes of patients. 	Multiplex analyses of mitochondria in colorectal cancer patients uncover novel diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities	Mitochondria, colorectal cancer, drug targets, multi-omics, prognosis	BACKGROUND: The identification of novel functional biomarkers is essential for recognizing high-risk patients, predicting recurrence, and searching for appropriate treatment. However, no prognostic biomarker has been applied for colorectal cancer (CRC) in the clinic. METHODS: Integrated with transcriptomic data from public databases, multi-omics examinations were conducted to search prognostic biomarkers for CRC. Moreover, the potential biological functions and regulatory mechanism of these predictive genes were also explored. RESULTS: In this study, we revealed that three mitochondrial genes were associated with the poor prognosis of CRC. Integrated analyses of transcriptome and proteome of CRC patients disclosed numerous down-regulated mitochondrial genes at both mRNA and protein levels, suggesting a vital role of mitochondria in carcinogenesis. Combined with the bioinformatics studies of transcriptomic datasets of 538 CRC patients, three mitochondrial prognostic genes were eventually selected out, including HIGD1A, SUCLG2, and SLC25A24. The expression of HIGD1A exhibited a significant reduction in two subtypes of adenoma and six subtypes of CRC, while the down-regulation of SUCLG2 and SLC25A24 showed more advantages in rectal mucinous adenocarcinoma. Moreover, we unveiled that these three genes had common expressions and might collaboratively participate in the synthesis of ribosomes. Our original multi-omics datasets, including DNA methylation, structural variants, chromatin accessibility, and phosphoproteome, further depicted the altered modifications on their potential transcriptional factors. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, HIGD1A, SUCLG2, and SLC25A24 might serve as predictive biomarkers for CRC. The biological activities they involved in and their upstream regulators we uncovered would provide a functional context for the further-in-depth mechanism study.
PXD020135	34177844	Combined Analysis of the Time-Resolved Transcriptome and Proteome of Plant Pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. 	Time-resolved combined analysis of transcriptome and proteome of the pathogenicity-activated plant pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Xoo-rice interactions, pathogenicity, time-resolved gene expression, transcriptome	Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a plant pathogen responsible for causing bacterial blight in rice. The immediate alterations in Xoo upon initial contact with rice are essential for pathogenesis. We studied time-resolved genome-wide gene expression in pathogenicity-activated Xoo cells at the transcriptome and proteome levels. The early response genes of Xoo include genes related to cell motility, inorganic ion transport, and effectors. The alteration of gene expression is initiated as early as few minutes after the initial interaction and changes with time. The time-resolved comparison of the transcriptome and proteome shows the differences between transcriptional and translational expression peaks in many genes, although the overall expression pattern of mRNAs and proteins is conserved. The discrepancy suggests an important role of translational regulation in Xoo at the early stages of pathogenesis. The gene expression analysis using time-resolved transcriptome and proteome provides unprecedented valuable information regarding Xoo pathogenesis.
PXD022830	34177868	What's a Biofilm?-How the Choice of the Biofilm Model Impacts the Protein Inventory of Clostridioides difficile. 	Differences in gene expression between colony and aggregate biofilms of Clostridioides difficile revealed by proteomic profiling	Biofilm, Cell surface antigens, Clostridioides difficile, Persistence, RpoN signaling	The anaerobic pathogen Clostridioides difficile is perfectly equipped to survive and persist inside the mammalian intestine. When facing unfavorable conditions C. difficile is able to form highly resistant endospores. Likewise, biofilms are currently discussed as form of persistence. Here a comprehensive proteomics approach was applied to investigate the molecular processes of C. difficile strain 630Deltaerm underlying biofilm formation. The comparison of the proteome from two different forms of biofilm-like growth, namely aggregate biofilms and colonies on agar plates, revealed major differences in the formation of cell surface proteins, as well as enzymes of its energy and stress metabolism. For instance, while the obtained data suggest that aggregate biofilm cells express both flagella, type IV pili and enzymes required for biosynthesis of cell-surface polysaccharides, the S-layer protein SlpA and most cell wall proteins (CWPs) encoded adjacent to SlpA were detected in significantly lower amounts in aggregate biofilm cells than in colony biofilms. Moreover, the obtained data suggested that aggregate biofilm cells are rather actively growing cells while colony biofilm cells most likely severely suffer from a lack of reductive equivalents what requires induction of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and C. difficile's V-type ATPase to maintain cell homeostasis. In agreement with this, aggregate biofilm cells, in contrast to colony biofilm cells, neither induced toxin nor spore production. Finally, the data revealed that the sigma factor SigL/RpoN and its dependent regulators are noticeably induced in aggregate biofilms suggesting an important role of SigL/RpoN in aggregate biofilm formation.
PXD024489	34178940	In-House Packed Porous Graphitic Carbon Columns for Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of N-Glycans. 	In-house packed porous graphitic carbon columns for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of N-glycans	Hypercarb, LCMSN-Glycan, Liquid Chromatography, N-glycan, PGC, Porous Graphitic Carbon	Protein glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that modulates biological processes such as the immune response and protein trafficking. Altered glycosylation profiles are associated with cancer and inflammatory diseases, as well as impacting the efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Consisting of oligosaccharides attached to asparagine residues, enzymatically released N-linked glycans are analytically challenging due to the diversity of isomeric structures that exist. A commonly used technique for quantitative N-glycan analysis is liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), which performs glycan separation and characterization. Although many reversed and normal stationary phases have been utilized for the separation of N-glycans, porous graphitic carbon (PGC) chromatography has become desirable because of its higher resolving capability, but is difficult to implement in a robust and reproducible manner. Herein, we demonstrate the analytical properties of a 15 cm fused silica capillary (75 microm i.d., 360 microm o.d.) packed in-house with Hypercarb PGC (3 microm) coupled to an Agilent 6550 Q-TOF mass spectrometer for N-glycan analysis in positive ion mode. In repeatability and intermediate precision measurements conducted on released N-glycans from a glycoprotein standard mixture, the majority of N-glycans reported low coefficients of variation with respect to retention times (<=4.2%) and peak areas (<=14.4%). N-glycans released from complex samples were also examined by PGC LC-MS. A total of 120 N-glycan structural and compositional isomers were obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ovarian cancer tissue sections. Finally, a comparison between early- and late-stage formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ovarian cancer tissues revealed qualitative changes in the alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-sialic acid linkage of a fucosylated bi-antennary complex N-glycan. Although the alpha2,3-linkage was predominant in late-stage ovarian cancer, the alternate alpha2,6-linkage was more prevalent in early-stage ovarian cancer. This study establishes the utility of in-house packed PGC columns for the robust and reproducible LC-MS analysis of N-glycans.
PXD024105	34178943	Identification of Dysregulated Complement Activation Pathways Driven by N-Glycosylation Alterations in T2D Patients. 	Integrative proteomic and glycoproteomic landscape of diabetes	Diabetes, Glycoproteomic	Diabetes has become a major public health concern worldwide, most of which are type 2 diabetes (T2D). The diagnosis of T2D is commonly based on plasma glucose levels, and there are no reliable clinical biomarkers available for early detection. Recent advances in proteome technologies offer new opportunity for the understanding of T2D; however, the underlying proteomic characteristics of T2D have not been thoroughly investigated yet. Here, using proteomic and glycoproteomic profiling, we provided a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations in the fasting plasma of the 24 Chinese participants, including eight T2D patients, eight prediabetic (PDB) subjects, and eight healthy control (HC) individuals. Our analyses identified a diverse set of potential biomarkers that might enhance the efficiency and accuracy based on current existing biological indicators of (pre)diabetes. Through integrative omics analysis, we showed the capability of glycoproteomics as a complement to proteomics or metabolomics, to provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of (pre)diabetes. We have newly identified systemic site-specific N-glycosylation alterations underlying T2D patients in the complement activation pathways, including decreased levels of N-glycopeptides from C1s, MASP1, and CFP proteins, and increased levels of N-glycopeptides from C2, C4, C4BPA, C4BPB, and CFH. These alterations were not observed at proteomic levels, suggesting new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Our results demonstrate a great potential role of glycoproteomics in understanding (pre)diabetes and present a new direction for diabetes research which deserves more attention.
PXD023872	34179788	Identification of the MuRF1 Skeletal Muscle Ubiquitylome Through Quantitative Proteomics. 	Identification of the MuRF1 skeletal muscle ubiquitylome through quantitative proteomics	MuRF1, electroporation, muscle atrophy, protein degradation, ubiquitin proteomics	MuRF1 (TRIM63) is a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase and component of the ubiquitin proteasome system. MuRF1 is transcriptionally upregulated under conditions that cause muscle loss, in both rodents and humans, and is a recognized marker of muscle atrophy. In this study, we used in vivo electroporation to determine whether MuRF1 overexpression alone can cause muscle atrophy and, in combination with ubiquitin proteomics, identify the endogenous MuRF1 substrates in skeletal muscle. Overexpression of MuRF1 in adult mice increases ubiquitination of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, increases expression of genes associated with neuromuscular junction instability, and causes muscle atrophy. A total of 169 ubiquitination sites on 56 proteins were found to be regulated by MuRF1. MuRF1-mediated ubiquitination targeted both thick and thin filament contractile proteins, as well as, glycolytic enzymes, deubiquitinases, p62, and VCP. These data reveal a potential role for MuRF1 in not only the breakdown of the sarcomere but also the regulation of metabolism and other proteolytic pathways in skeletal muscle.
PXD026718	34181849	Proximity Tagging Identifies the Glycan-Mediated Glycoprotein Interactors of Galectin-1 in Muscle Stem Cells. 	APEX-Gal1 Labeled C2C12 Myoblasts	LC/MSMS, Myoblasts	Myogenic differentiation, the irreversible developmental process where precursor myoblast muscle stem cells become contractile myotubes, is heavily regulated by glycosylation and glycan-protein interactions at the cell surface and the extracellular matrix. The glycan-binding protein galectin-1 has been found to be a potent activator of myogenic differentiation. While it is being explored as a potential therapeutic for muscle repair, a precise understanding of its glycoprotein interactors is lacking. These gaps are due in part to the difficulties of capturing glycan-protein interactions in live cells. Here, we demonstrate the use of a proximity tagging strategy coupled with quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to capture, enrich, and identify the glycan-mediated glycoprotein interactors of galectin-1 in cultured live mouse myoblasts. Our interactome dataset can serve as a resource to aid the determination of mechanisms through which galectin-1 promotes myogenic differentiation. Moreover, it can also facilitate the determination of the physiological glycoprotein counter-receptors of galectin-1. Indeed, we identify several known and novel glycan-mediated ligands of galectin-1 as well as validate that galectin-1 binds the native CD44 glycoprotein in a glycan-mediated manner.
PXD026281	34181950	In vitro reconstitution of Sgk3 activation by phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. 	Mapping of phosphorylation sites on Sgk3 by LC-MS/MS	Sgk3, activation loop, hydrophobic motif, phosphorylation, turn motif	Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 3 (Sgk3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase activated by the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) downstream of growth factor signaling via class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling and by class III PI3K/Vps34-mediated PI3P production on endosomes. Upregulation of Sgk3 activity has recently been linked to a number of human cancers; however, the precise mechanism of activation of Sgk3 is unknown. Here, we use a wide range of cell biological, biochemical, and biophysical techniques, including hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, to investigate the mechanism of activation of Sgk3 by PI3P. We show that Sgk3 is regulated by a combination of phosphorylation and allosteric activation. We demonstrate that binding of Sgk3 to PI3P via its regulatory phox homology (PX) domain induces large conformational changes in Sgk3 associated with its activation and that the PI3P-binding pocket of the PX domain of Sgk3 is sequestered in its inactive conformation. Finally, we reconstitute Sgk3 activation via Vps34-mediated PI3P synthesis on phosphatidylinositol liposomes in vitro. In addition to identifying the mechanism of Sgk3 activation by PI3P, our findings open up potential therapeutic avenues in allosteric inhibitor development to target Sgk3 in cancer.
PXD024598	34183388	Deep Dive on the Proteome of Human Body Fluids: A Valuable Data Resource for Biomarker Discovery. 	The Proteome of Human Body Fluids	Biomarker discovery, Body fluid	BACKGROUND/AIM: Body fluids are considered to be a rich source of disease biomarkers. Proteins in many body fluids have potential clinical applications for disease diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The aim of this study was to establish an in-depth multi-body fluid proteome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten body fluids associated with 8 types of cancers collected from 23 patients involved in 19 common diseases underwent liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MS) analysis after gel-based protein separation (SDS-PAGE) or peptide-based fractionations. Bioinformatic analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA), consensus clustering, and hierarchical clustering analysis were also performed. The biological function was determined using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). RESULTS: We profiled the proteome of ten body fluids, including ascites, bile, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), hydrothorax, knee joint fluid (KJF), plasma, saliva, serum, tears, and urine. A total of 3,396 nonredundant proteins were identified, of which 304 were shared among ten body fluids, with common functions in focal adhesion and complement/coagulation cascades. A total of 41.5% (1,409) of the proteins were detected in only one body fluid and were closely related to their adjacent tissues by function. The functional analysis of the remaining 1,683 proteins showed that similar functions might be shared among different body fluids, which further highlighted the close connection of body fluids in the human body. CONCLUSION: A deep proteome of multi-body fluids originated from patients diagnosed with 19 common diseases provides a valuable data resource, and might indicate the potential application of body fluids for biomarker discovery.
PXD023297	34185417	Medial septum tau accumulation induces spatial memory deficit via disrupting medial septum-hippocampus cholinergic pathway. 	Tau accumulation induces spatial memory deficit via disrupting medial septum-hippocampus cholinergic pathway	Alzheimer's disease, cholinergic neuron, hippocampus, medial septum, tau accumulation	Tau accumulation and cholinergic impairment are characteristic pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the causal role of tau accumulation in cholinergic lesion is elusive. Here, we observed an aberrant tau accumulation in the medial septum (MS) of 3xTg and 5xFAD mice, especially in their cholinergic neurons. Overexpressing hTau in mouse MS (MS(hTau) ) for 6 months but not 3 months induced spatial memory impairment without changing object recognition and anxiety-like behavior, indicating a specific and time-dependent effect of MS-hTau accumulation on spatial cognitive functions. With increasing hTau accumulation, the MS(hTau) mice showed a time-dependent cholinergic neuron loss with reduced cholinergic projections to the hippocampus. Intraperitoneal administration of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, for 1 month ameliorated the MS-hTau-induced spatial memory deficits with preservation of MS-hippocampal cholinergic pathway and removal of tau load; and the beneficial effects of donepezil was more prominent at low dose. Proteomics revealed that MS-hTau accumulation deregulated multiple signaling pathways with numerous differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Among them, the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 37D (VP37D), an autophagy-related protein, was significantly reduced in MS(hTau) mice; the reduction of VP37D was restored by donepezil, and the effect was more significant at low dose than high dose. These novel evidences reveal a causal role of tau accumulation in linking MS cholinergic lesion to hippocampus-dependent spatial cognitive damages as seen in the AD patients, and the new tau-removal and autophagy-promoting effects of donepezil may extend its application beyond simple symptom amelioration to potential disease modification.
PXD025757	34185510	Chemoproteomic Approach toward Probing the Interactomes of Perfluoroalkyl Substances. 	A Chemoproteomic Approach toward Probing the Interactomes of Perfluoroalkyl Substances	PFASs, Probe	Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are widely used in industrial products and consumer goods. Due to their extremely recalcitrant nature and potential bioaccumulation and toxicity, exposure to PFASs may result in adverse health outcomes in humans and wildlife. In this study, we developed a chemoproteomic strategy, based on the use of isotope-coded desthiobiotin-perfluorooctanephosphonic acid (PFOPA) probe and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, to profile PFAS-binding proteins. Targeted proteins were labeled with the desthiobiotin-PFOPA probe, digested with trypsin, and the ensuing desthiobiotin-conjugated peptides were enriched with streptavidin beads for LC-MS/MS analysis. We were able to identify 469 putative PFOPA-binding proteins. By conducting competitive binding experiments using low (10 muM) and high (100 muM) concentrations of stable isotope-labeled PFOPA probes, we further identified 128 nonredundant peptides derived from 75 unique proteins that exhibit selective binding toward PFOPA. Additionally, we demonstrated that one of these proteins, fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5), could interact directly with PFASs, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). Furthermore, desthiobiotin-labeled lysine residues are located close to the fatty acid-binding pocket of FABP5, and the binding affinity varies with the structures of PFASs. Taken together, we developed a novel chemoproteomic method for interrogating the PFAS-interacting proteome. The identification of these proteins sets the stage for understanding the mechanisms through which exposure to PFASs confers adverse human health effects.
PXD026573	34185709	Proteogenomic identification of an immunogenic HLA class I neoantigen in mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer tissue. 	HLA class I ligandome of colon cancer tissues for neoantigen identification	HLA ligandome analysis, proteogenomics	Although CD8+ T cells recognize neoantigens that arise from somatic mutations in cancer, only a small fraction of nonsynonymous mutations give rise to clinically relevant neoantigens. In this study, HLA class I ligandomes of a panel of human colorectal cancer (CRC) and matched normal tissues were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based proteogenomic analysis. Neoantigen presentation was rare; however, the analysis detected a single neoantigen in a mismatch repair-deficient CRC (dMMR-CRC) tissue sample carrying 3967 nonsynonymous mutations, where abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and inflamed gene expression status were observed in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Using the HLA class I ligandome data and gene expression profiles, a set of nonmutated tumor-associated antigen (TAA) candidates was concomitantly identified. Interestingly, CD8+ TILs predominantly recognized the detected neoantigen over the array of TAA candidates. Neoantigen-reactive CD8+ TILs showed PD-1 positivity and exhibited functional and specific responses. Moreover, T cell receptor (TCR) profiling identified the sequence of the neoantigen-reactive TCR clonotype and showed its expansion in the TME. Transduction of the sequenced TCR conferred neoantigen specificity and cytotoxicity to peripheral blood lymphocytes. The proteogenomic approach revealed the antigenic and reactive T cell landscape in dMMR-CRC, demonstrating the presence of an immunogenic neoantigen and its potential therapeutic applications.
PXD024566	34186245	Comparative Host Interactomes of the SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Protein 3 and Human Coronavirus Homologs. 	Comparative host interactomes of the SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 3 and human coronavirus homologs	AP-MS, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2	Human coronaviruses have become an increasing threat to global health; three highly pathogenic strains have emerged since the early 2000s, including most recently SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus pathogenesis is needed, including how these highly virulent strains differ from those that cause milder, common-cold-like disease. While significant progress has been made in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with the host cell, nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) has largely been omitted from the analyses. Nsp3 is a viral protease with important roles in viral protein biogenesis, replication complex formation, and modulation of host ubiquitinylation and ISGylation. Herein, we use affinity purification-mass spectrometry to study the host-viral protein-protein interactome of nsp3 from five coronavirus strains: pathogenic strains SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV; and endemic common-cold strains hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43. We divide each nsp3 into three fragments and use tandem mass tag technology to directly compare the interactors across the five strains for each fragment. We find that few interactors are common across all variants for a particular fragment, but we identify shared patterns between select variants, such as ribosomal proteins enriched in the N-terminal fragment (nsp3.1) data set for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We also identify unique biological processes enriched for individual homologs, for instance, nuclear protein import for the middle fragment of hCoV-229E, as well as ribosome biogenesis of the MERS nsp3.2 homolog. Lastly, we further investigate the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 N-terminal fragment with ATF6, a regulator of the unfolded protein response. We show that SARS-CoV-2 nsp3.1 directly binds to ATF6 and can suppress the ATF6 stress response. Characterizing the host interactions of nsp3 widens our understanding of how coronaviruses co-opt cellular pathways and presents new avenues for host-targeted antiviral therapeutics.
PXD023227	34186270	Alternatives for the worse: Molecular insights into adverse effects of bisphenol a and substitutes during human adipocyte differentiation. 	Adverse Effects of Bisphenol A and its substitute compounds on human SGBS preadipocytes	SGBS, adipocytes, bisphenol a, bpa	Bisphenol A (BPA), which is used in a variety of consumer-related plastic products, was reported to cause adverse effects, including disruption of adipocyte differentiation, interference with obesity mechanisms, and impairment of insulin- and glucose homeostasis. Substitute compounds are increasingly emerging but are not sufficiently investigated.We aimed to investigate the mode of action of BPA and four of its substitutes during the differentiation of human preadipocytes to adipocytes and their molecular interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a pivotal regulator of adipogenesis.Binding and effective biological activation of PPARgamma were investigated by surface plasmon resonance and reporter gene assay, respectively. Human preadipocytes were continuously exposed to BPA, BPS, BPB, BPF, BPAF, and the PPARgamma-antagonist GW9662. After 12 days of differentiation, lipid production was quantified via Oil Red O staining, and global protein profiles were assessed using LC-MS/MS-based proteomics. All tested bisphenols bound to human PPARgamma with similar efficacy as the natural ligand 15d-PGJ2in vitroand provoked an antagonistic effect on PPARgamma in the reporter gene assay at non-cytotoxic concentrations. During the differentiation of human preadipocytes, all bisphenols decreased lipid production. Global proteomics displayed a down-regulation of adipogenesis and metabolic pathways, similar to GW9662. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory pathways were up-regulated, MCP1 release was increased, and adiponectin decreased. pAKT/AKT ratios revealed significantly reduced insulin sensitivity by BPA, BPB, and BPS upon insulin stimulation.Thus, our results show that not only BPA but also its substitutes disrupt crucial metabolic functions and insulin signaling in adipocytes under low, environmentally relevant concentrations. This effect, mediated through inhibition of PPARgamma, may promote hypertrophy of adipose tissue and increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance.
PXD024141	34187905	SLX4IP promotes RAP1 SUMOylation by PIAS1 to coordinate telomere maintenance through NF-kappaB and Notch signaling. 	U2OS SLX4IP Knockout Telomere PICh	ALT, PICh, SLX4IP, telomeres	The maintenance of telomere length supports repetitive cell division and therefore plays a central role in cancer development and progression. Telomeres are extended by either the enzyme telomerase or the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we found that the telomere-associated protein SLX4IP dictates telomere proteome composition by recruiting and activating the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS1 to the SLX4 complex. PIAS1 SUMOylated the telomere-binding protein RAP1, which disrupted its interaction with the telomere-binding protein TRF2 and facilitated its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. In the cytosol, RAP1 bound to IkappaB kinase (IKK), resulting in activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and its induction of Jagged-1 expression, which promoted Notch signaling and the institution of ALT. This axis could be targeted therapeutically in ALT-driven cancers and in tumor cells that develop resistance to antitelomerase therapies. Our results illuminate the mechanisms underlying SLX4IP-dependent telomere plasticity and demonstrate the role of telomere proteins in directly coordinating intracellular signaling and telomere maintenance dynamics.
PXD021003	34188089	Constrained G4 structures unveil topology specificity of known and new G4 binding proteins. 	Identification of human proteins interacting with locked G4 structures	Constrained G4 structures, G-quadruplex, Proteins, RNA Pol II pausing, nanoLC-MS/MS	G-quadruplexes (G4) are non-canonical secondary structures consisting in stacked tetrads of hydrogen-bonded guanines bases. An essential feature of G4 is their intrinsic polymorphic nature, which is characterized by the equilibrium between several conformations (also called topologies) and the presence of different types of loops with variable lengths. In cells, G4 functions rely on protein or enzymatic factors that recognize and promote or resolve these structures. In order to characterize new G4-dependent mechanisms, extensive researches aimed at identifying new G4 binding proteins. Using G-rich single-stranded oligonucleotides that adopt non-controlled G4 conformations, a large number of G4-binding proteins have been identified in vitro, but their specificity towards G4 topology remained unknown. Constrained G4 structures are biomolecular objects based on the use of a rigid cyclic peptide scaffold as a template for directing the intramolecular assembly of the anchored oligonucleotides into a single and stabilized G4 topology. Here, using various constrained RNA or DNA G4 as baits in human cell extracts, we establish the topology preference of several well-known G4-interacting factors. Moreover, we identify new G4-interacting proteins such as the NELF complex involved in the RNA-Pol II pausing mechanism, and we show that it impacts the clastogenic effect of the G4-ligand pyridostatin.
PXD022903	34189442	PRISMA and BioID disclose a motifs-based interactome of the intrinsically disordered transcription factor C/EBPalpha. 	Combined Peptide array screen and proximity labeling proteomics fine map C/EBPa protein interactions	BioID, CEBPA, PTM, peptide pulldowns	C/EBPalpha represents a paradigm intrinsically disordered transcription factor containing short linear motifs and post-translational modifications (PTM). Unraveling C/EBPalpha protein interaction networks is a prerequisite for understanding the multi-modal functions of C/EBPalpha in hematopoiesis and leukemia. Here, we combined arrayed peptide matrix screening (PRISMA) with BioID to generate an in vivo validated and isoform specific interaction map of C/EBPalpha. The myeloid C/EBPalpha interactome comprises promiscuous and PTM-regulated interactions with protein machineries involved in gene expression, epigenetics, genome organization, DNA replication, RNA processing, and nuclear transport. C/EBPalpha interaction hotspots coincide with homologous conserved regions of the C/EBP family that also score as molecular recognition features. PTMs alter the interaction spectrum of C/EBP-motifs to configure a multi-valent transcription factor hub that interacts with multiple co-regulatory components, including BAF/SWI-SNF or Mediator complexes. Combining PRISMA and BioID is a powerful strategy to systematically explore the PTM-regulated interactomes of intrinsically disordered transcription factors.
PXD022198	34189564	The protein landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 	The Proteome Landscape of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, DIA-MS, LUMOS	Many functional consequences of mutations on tumor phenotypes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are unknown. This may be in part due to a scarcity of information on the proteome of CLL. We profiled the proteome of 117 CLL patient samples with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry and integrated the results with genomic, transcriptomic, ex vivo drug response, and clinical outcome data. We found trisomy 12, IGHV mutational status, mutated SF3B1, trisomy 19, del(17)(p13), del(11)(q22.3), mutated DDX3X and MED12 to influence protein expression (false discovery rate [FDR] = 5%). Trisomy 12 and IGHV status were the major determinants of protein expression variation in CLL as shown by principal-component analysis (1055 and 542 differentially expressed proteins, FDR = 5%). Gene set enrichment analyses of CLL with trisomy 12 implicated B-cell receptor (BCR)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling as a tumor driver. These findings were supported by analyses of protein abundance buffering and protein complex formation, which identified limited protein abundance buffering and an upregulated protein complex involved in BCR, AKT, MAPK, and PI3K signaling in trisomy 12 CLL. A survey of proteins associated with trisomy 12/IGHV-independent drug response linked STAT2 protein expression with response to kinase inhibitors, including Bruton tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors. STAT2 was upregulated in unmutated IGHV CLL and trisomy 12 CLL and required for chemokine/cytokine signaling (interferon response). This study highlights the importance of protein abundance data as a nonredundant layer of information in tumor biology and provides a protein expression reference map for CLL.
PXD023902	34191328	Increased levels of mitochondrial import factor Mia40 prevent the aggregation of polyQ proteins in the cytosol. 	Increased levels of the mitochondrial import factor Mia40 can prevent the aggregation of polyQ proteins in the cytosol	Huntingtin / Mia40 / Mitochondria / Protein aggregation / Protein translocation	The formation of protein aggregates is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Observations on patient samples and model systems demonstrated links between aggregate formation and declining mitochondrial functionality, but causalities remain unclear. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to analyze how mitochondrial processes regulate the behavior of aggregation-prone polyQ protein derived from human huntingtin. Expression of Q97-GFP rapidly led to insoluble cytosolic aggregates and cell death. Although aggregation impaired mitochondrial respiration only slightly, it considerably interfered with the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Mutants in the import component Mia40 were hypersensitive to Q97-GFP, whereas Mia40 overexpression strongly suppressed the formation of toxic Q97-GFP aggregates both in yeast and in human cells. Based on these observations, we propose that the post-translational import of mitochondrial precursor proteins into mitochondria competes with aggregation-prone cytosolic proteins for chaperones and proteasome capacity. Mia40 regulates this competition as it has a rate-limiting role in mitochondrial protein import. Therefore, Mia40 is a dynamic regulator in mitochondrial biogenesis that can be exploited to stabilize cytosolic proteostasis.
PXD016174	34192536	An Hsp90 co-chaperone links protein folding and degradation and is part of a conserved protein quality control. 	Sgt1 interactome analysis under proteostatic stress and steady state conditions	HAPI, Protein quality control, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sgt1, heat shock	In this paper, we show that the essential Hsp90 co-chaperone Sgt1 is a member of a general protein quality control network that links folding and degradation through its participation in the degradation of misfolded proteins both in the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Sgt1-dependent protein degradation acts in a parallel pathway to the ubiquitin ligase (E3) and ubiquitin chain elongase (E4), Hul5, and overproduction of Hul5 partly suppresses defects in cells with reduced Sgt1 activity. Upon proteostatic stress, Sgt1 accumulates transiently, in an Hsp90- and proteasome-dependent manner, with quality control sites (Q-bodies) of both yeast and human cells that co-localize with Vps13, a protein that creates organelle contact sites. Misfolding disease proteins, such as synphilin-1 involved in Parkinson's disease, are also sequestered to these compartments and require Sgt1 for their clearance.
PXD021909	34193845	Integrative iTRAQ-based proteomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals the accumulation patterns of key metabolites associated with oil quality during seed ripening of Camellia oleifera. 	Proteomics of Camellia oleifera seeds at different development stages	Camellia oleifera, seed	Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera) is one of the four major woody oil-bearing crops in the world and has relatively high ecological, economic, and medicinal value. Its seeds undergo a series of complex physiological and biochemical changes during ripening, which is mainly manifested as the accumulation and transformation of certain metabolites closely related to oil quality, especially flavonoids and fatty acids. To obtain new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, a parallel analysis of the transcriptome and proteome profiles of C. oleifera seeds at different maturity levels was conducted using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) complemented with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data. A total of 16,530 transcripts and 1228 proteins were recognized with significant differential abundances in pairwise comparisons of samples at various developmental stages. Among these, 317 were coexpressed with a poor correlation, and most were involved in metabolic processes, including fatty acid metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. In addition, the content of total flavonoids decreased gradually with seed maturity, and the levels of fatty acids generally peaked at the fat accumulation stage; these results basically agreed with the regulation patterns of genes or proteins in the corresponding pathways. The expression levels of proteins annotated as upstream candidates of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS) as well as their cognate transcripts were positively correlated with the variation in the flavonoid content, while shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT)-encoding genes had the opposite pattern. The increase in the abundance of proteins and mRNAs corresponding to alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was associated with a reduction in linoleic acid synthesis. Using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), we further identified six unique modules related to flavonoid, oil, and fatty acid anabolism that contained hub genes or proteins similar to transcription factors (TFs), such as MADS intervening keratin-like and C-terminal (MIKC_MADS), type-B authentic response regulator (ARR-B), and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH). Finally, based on the known metabolic pathways and WGCNA combined with the correlation analysis, five coexpressed transcripts and proteins composed of cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs), caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT), flavonol synthase (FLS), and 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL) were screened out. With this exploratory multiomics dataset, our results presented a dynamic picture regarding the maturation process of C. oleifera seeds on Hainan Island, not only revealing the temporal specific expression of key candidate genes and proteins but also providing a scientific basis for the genetic improvement of this tree species.
PXD020711	34194321	iTRAQ-Based Proteomics Reveals Gu-Ben-Fang-Xiao Decoction Alleviates Airway Remodeling via Reducing Extracellular Matrix Deposition in a Murine Model of Chronic Remission Asthma. 	Gu-Ben-Fang-Xiao decoction ameliorates airway remodeling by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway mediated by RTN4 in a chronic remission asthma murine model	Gu-Ben-Fang-Xiao decoction, PI3K/AKT pathway, RTN4, airway remodeling, chronic remission asthma	Airway remodeling is a primary pathological feature of asthma. The current therapy for asthma mainly targets reducing inflammation but not particularly airway remodeling. Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop alternative and more effective therapies to attenuate remodeling. Gu-Ben-Fang-Xiao Decoction (GBFXD) has been used to effectively and safely treat asthma for decades. In this study, GBFXD regulated airway inflammation, collagen deposition, and the molecules relevant to airway remodeling such as Vimentin, alpha-SMA, hydroxyproline, and E-cadherin in chronic remission asthma (CRA) murine model. Proteomic analysis indicated that the overlapping differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (Model/Control and GBFXD/Model) were mainly collagens and laminins, which were extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In addition, the KEGG analysis showed that GBFXD could regulate pathways related to airway remodeling including ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which were the top three significantly enriched pathways containing the most DEPs for both Model/Control and GBFXD/Model. Further validation research showed that GBFXD regulated reticulon-4 (RTN4) and suppressed the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway to alleviate ECM proteins deposition. In conclusion, our findings indicate that GBFXD possibly regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway via RTN4 to improve airway remodeling, which provides a new insight into the molecular mechanism of GBFXD for the treatment of CRA.
PXD017068	34194496	Exploration of the Key Proteins in the Normal-Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence of Colorectal Cancer Evolution Using In-Depth Quantitative Proteomics. 	UTP18 as an oncogene promotes colorectal adenoma to carcinoma progression	Colorectal adenoma to carcinoma progression, Oncogene, UTP18	PURPOSE: In most cases, the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) follows the normal-adenoma-carcinoma (N-A-C) sequence. In this study, we aimed to identify the key proteins in the N-A-C sequence. METHODS: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in normal, adenoma, and carcinoma tissues were identified using the Tandem Mass Tag- (TMT-) based quantitative proteomics approach. The landscape of proteomic variation in the N-A-C sequence was explored using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Proteomaps. Key proteins in the N-A-C sequence were identified, verified, and validated based on our proteomic data, external proteomic data, and external transcriptomic data in the ProteomeXchange, CPTAC, GEO, and TCGA databases. The prognostic value of the key proteins in our database was evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The effects of the key proteins on adenoma organoids and colorectal cancer cells were explored in functional studies. RESULTS: Based on our proteomic profiles, we identified 1,294 DEPs between the carcinoma (CG) and normal (NG) groups, 919 DEPs between the adenoma group (AG) and NG, and 1,030 DEPs between the CG and AG. Ribosome- and spliceosome-related pathways were mainly enriched in the N-A process. Extracellular matrix- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition- (EMT-) related pathways were mainly enriched in the A-C process. RRP12 and SERPINH1 were identified, verified, and validated as candidate key proteins in the N-A and A-C processes, respectively. Furthermore, RRP12 and SERPINH1 knockdown impeded the viability and proliferation of adenoma organoids. SERPINH1 was validated as a risk factor for disease-free survival (DFS) based on the TCGA and our database, whereas RRP12 did not show prognostic value. SERPINH1 knockdown was accompanied by EMT-related protein variation, increased apoptosis, and reduced proliferation, invasion, and migration of CRC cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: RRP12 and SERPINH1 may play an important role in the N-A and A-C processes, respectively. Furthermore, SERPINH1 showed favorable prognostic value for DFS in CRC patients. We speculate that SERPINH1 might promote not only the A-C process but also the development of CRC.
PXD024658	34195100	Proteomics Investigation of the Time Course Responses of RAW264.7 Macrophages to Infections With the Wild-Type and Twin-Arginine Translocation Mutant Strains of Brucella melitensis. 	Proteomics investigation of the time course responses of RAW264.7 macrophages to infections with the wild-type and twin-arginine translocation mutant strains of Brucella melitensis	Brucella melitensis, RAW264.7 cell model, immune response, twin-arginine protein translocation	Brucella, a notorious intracellular pathogen, causes chronic infections in many mammals, including humans. The twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway transports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane; protein substrates translocated by Brucella include ABC transporters, oxidoreductases, and cell envelope biosynthesis proteins. Previously, we showed that a Tat mutant of Brucella melitensis M28 exhibits reduced survival within murine macrophages. In this study, we compared the host responses elicited by wild-type M28 and its Tat-mutant strains ex vivo. We utilized label-free quantitative proteomics to assess proteomic changes in RAW264.7 macrophages after infection with M28 and its Tat mutants. A total of 6085 macrophage proteins were identified with high confidence, and 79, 50, and 99 proteins were differentially produced upon infection with the Tat mutant at 4, 24, and 48 hpi, respectively, relative to the wild-type infection. Gene ontology and KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that immune response-related proteins were enriched among the upregulated proteins. Compared to the wild-type M28 infection, the most upregulated proteins upon Tat-mutant infection included the cytosolic nucleic acid signaling pathway-related proteins IFIH1, DHX58, IFI202, IFI204, and ISG15 and the NF-kappaB signaling pathway-related proteins PTGS2, CD40, and TRAF1, suggesting that the host increases the production of these proteins in response to Tat mutant infection. Upregulation of some proteins was further verified by a parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) assay. ELISA and qRT-PCR assays indicated that Tat mutant infection significantly induced proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and nitric oxide (NO) production. Finally, we showed that the Tat mutant displays higher sensitivity to nitrosative stress than the wild type and that treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NMMA significantly increases the intracellular survival of the Tat mutant, indicating that NO production contributes to restricting Tat mutant survival within macrophages. Collectively, this work improves our understanding of host immune responses to Tat mutants and provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the attenuated virulence of Tat mutants.
PXD020410	34195683	In-depth proteomics analysis of sentinel lymph nodes from individuals with endometrial cancer. 	Sentinel Lymph Node and Endometrial Cancer Grade in depth Proteomic Analyses : A Novel Approach for Molecular Diagnosis	Endometrial Cancer, Ghost proteome, Protein mutations, Sentinel Lymph Nodes, Small prot, diagnosis	Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common gynecological cancers worldwide. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status could be a major prognostic factor in evaluation of EC, but several prospective studies need to be performed. Here we report an in-depth proteomics analysis showing significant variations in the SLN protein landscape in EC. We show that SLNs are correlated to each tumor grade, which strengthens evidence of SLN involvement in EC. A few proteins are overexpressed specifically at each EC tumor grade and in the corresponding SLN. These proteins, which are significantly variable in both locations, should be considered potential markers of overall survival. Five major proteins for EC and SLN (PRSS3, PTX3, ASS1, ALDH2, and ANXA1) were identified in large-scale proteomics and validated by immunohistochemistry. This study improves stratification and diagnosis of individuals with EC as a result of proteomics profiling of SLNs.
PXD011895	34196494	Integrative proteomics reveals the role of E3 ubiquitin ligase SYVN1 in hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis. 	Quantitative Proteomic Atlas of Ubiquitination in Hepatocellular Carcinoma	Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Ubiquitination	BACKGROUND: Tumor metastasis is a major factor for poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the relationship between ubiquitination and metastasis need to be studied more systematically. We analyzed the ubiquitinome of HCC in this study to have a more comprehensive insight into human HCC metastasis. METHODS: The protein ubiquitination levels in 15 HCC specimens with vascular invasion and 15 without vascular invasion were detected by ubiquitinome. Proteins with significantly different ubiquitination levels between HCCs with and without vascular invasion were used to predict E3 ubiquitin ligases associated with tumor metastasis. The topological network of protein substrates and corresponding E3 ubiquitin ligases was constructed to identify the key E3 ubiquitin ligase. Besides, the growth, migration and invasion ability of LM3 and HUH7 hepatoma cell lines with and without SYVN1 expression interference were measured by cell proliferation assay, subcutaneous tumor assay, umphal vein endothelium tube formation assay, transwell migration and invasion assays. Finally, the interacting proteins of SYVN1 were screened and verified by protein interaction omics, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation. Ubiquitin levels of related protein substrates in LM3 and HUH7 cells were compared in negative control, SYVN1 knockdown, and SYVN1 overexpression groups. RESULTS: In this study, our whole-cell proteomic dataset and ubiquitinomic dataset contained approximately 5600 proteins and 12,000 ubiquitinated sites. We discovered increased ubiquitinated sites with shorter ubiquitin chains during the progression of HCC metastasis. In addition, proteomic and ubiquitinomic analyses revealed that high expression of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SYVN1 is related with tumor metastasis. Furthermore, we found that SYVN1 interacted with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and impacted the ubiquitination of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K). CONCLUSIONS: The ubiquitination profiles of HCC with and without vascular invasion were significantly different. SYVN1 was the most important E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase responsible for this phenomenon, and it was related with tumor metastasis and growth. Therefore, SYVN1 might be a potential therapeutic target for HCC.
PXD024624	34198070	Reduced exploratory behavior in neuronal nucleoredoxin knockout mice. 	Protein expression and oxidation in the hippocampus of neuronal nucleoredoxin knockout (Nestin-NXN-/-) versus floxed control mice (NXN-flfl)	hippocampus, nucleoredoxin, oxidoreductase, redoxin	Nucleoredoxin is a thioredoxin-like redoxin that has been recognized as redox modulator of WNT signaling. Using a Yeast-2-Hybrid screen, we identified calcium calmodulin kinase 2a, Camk2a, as a prominent prey in a brain library. Camk2a is crucial for nitric oxide dependent processes of neuronal plasticity of learning and memory. Therefore, the present study assessed functions of NXN in neuronal Nestin-NXN(-/-) deficient mice. The NXN-Camk2a interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation, and by colocalization in neuropil and dendritic spines. Functionally, Camk2a activity was reduced in NXN deficient neurons and restored with recombinant NXN. Proteomics revealed reduced oxidation in the hippocampus of Nestin-NXN(-/-) deficient mice, including Camk2a, further synaptic and mitochondrial proteins, and was associated with a reduction of mitochondrial respiration. Nestin-NXN(-/-) mice were healthy and behaved normally in behavioral tests of anxiety, activity and sociability. They had no cognitive deficits in touchscreen based learning & memory tasks, but omitted more trials showing a lower interest in the reward. They also engaged less in rewarding voluntary wheel running, and in exploratory behavior in IntelliCages. Accuracy was enhanced owing to the loss of exploration. The data suggested that NXN maintained the oxidative state of Camk2a and thereby its activity. In addition, it supported oxidation of other synaptic and mitochondrial proteins, and mitochondrial respiration. The loss of NXN-dependent pro-oxidative functions manifested in a loss of exploratory drive and reduced interest in reward in behaving mice.
PXD025150	34199928	Identification of Fucosylated SERPINA1 as a Novel Plasma Marker for Pancreatic Cancer Using Lectin Affinity Capture Coupled with iTRAQ-Based Quantitative Glycoproteomics. 	LC-MS/MS analysis of pancreatic cancer plasma	AAL, fucosylated SERPINA1, glycobiomarker, iTRAQ-based quantitative proteome, pancreatic cancer, plasma, reverse lectin-based ELISA	Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive cancer with a high mortality rate, necessitating the development of effective diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers for disease management. Aberrantly fucosylated proteins in PC are considered a valuable resource of clinically useful biomarkers. The main objective of the present study was to identify novel plasma glycobiomarkers of PC using the iTRAQ quantitative proteomics approach coupled with Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL)-based glycopeptide enrichment and isotope-coded glycosylation site-specific tagging, with a view to analyzing the glycoproteome profiles of plasma samples from patients with non-metastatic and metastatic PC and gallstones (GS). As a result, 22 glycopeptides with significantly elevated levels in plasma samples of PC were identified. Fucosylated SERPINA1 (fuco-SERPINA1) was selected for further validation in 121 plasma samples (50 GS and 71 PC) using an AAL-based reverse lectin ELISA technique developed in-house. Our analyses revealed significantly higher plasma levels of fuco-SERPINA1 in PC than GS subjects (310.7 ng/mL v.s. 153.6 ng/mL, p = 0.0114). Elevated fuco-SERPINA1 levels were associated with higher TNM stage (p = 0.024) and poorer prognosis for overall survival (log-rank test, p = 0.0083). The increased plasma fuco-SERPINA1 levels support the utility of this protein as a novel prognosticator for PC.
PXD024770	34200965	Differential Glycosite Profiling-A Versatile Method to Compare Membrane Glycoproteomes. 	2DG-induced protein glycosylation alterations in colorectal cancer cells CX1 using differential glycosite profiling	2-deoxy-glucose, Glycoproteomics, colorectal cancer, glycopeptide, glycosite	Glycosylation is the most prevalent and varied form of post-translational protein modifications. Protein glycosylation regulates multiple cellular functions, including protein folding, cell adhesion, molecular trafficking and clearance, receptor activation, signal transduction, and endocytosis. In particular, membrane proteins are frequently highly glycosylated, which is both linked to physiological processes and of high relevance in various disease mechanisms. The cellular glycome is increasingly considered to be a therapeutic target. Here we describe a new strategy to compare membrane glycoproteomes, thereby identifying proteins with altered glycan structures and the respective glycosites. The workflow started with an optimized procedure for the digestion of membrane proteins followed by the lectin-based isolation of glycopeptides. Since alterations in the glycan part of a glycopeptide cause mass alterations, analytical size exclusion chromatography was applied to detect these mass shifts. N-glycosidase treatment combined with nanoUPLC-coupled mass spectrometry identified the altered glycoproteins and respective glycosites. The methodology was established using the colon cancer cell line CX1, which was treated with 2-deoxy-glucose-a modulator of N-glycosylation. The described methodology is not restricted to cell culture, as it can also be adapted to tissue samples or body fluids. Altogether, it is a useful module in various experimental settings that target glycan functions.
PXD025785	34201207	Re-Discovery of Giardiavirus: Genomic and Functional Analysis of Viruses from Giardia duodenalis Isolates. 	Sequence  analysis of Giardia virus proteins by LC-MS/MS	Giardia duodenalis, Giardiavirus	Giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia duodenalis, is an intestinal diarrheal disease affecting almost one billion people worldwide. A small endosymbiotic dsRNA viruses, G. lamblia virus (GLV), genus Giardiavirus, family Totiviridae, might inhabit human and animal isolates of G. duodenalis. Three GLV genomes have been sequenced so far, and only one was intensively studied; moreover, a positive correlation between GLV and parasite virulence is yet to be proved. To understand the biological significance of GLV infection in Giardia, the characterization of several GLV strains from naturally infected G. duodenalis isolates is necessary. Here we report high-throughput sequencing of four GLVs strains, from Giardia isolates of human and animal origin. We also report on a new, unclassified viral sequence (designed GdRV-2), unrelated to Giardiavirus, encoding and expressing for a single large protein with an RdRp domain homologous to Totiviridae and Botybirnaviridae. The result of our sequencing and proteomic analyses challenge the current knowledge on GLV and strongly suggest that viral capsid protein translation unusually starts with a proline and that translation of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) occurs via a +1/-2 ribosomal frameshift mechanism. Nucleotide polymorphism, confirmed by mass-spectrometry analysis, was also observed among and between GLV strains. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the occurrence of at least two GLV subtypes which display different phenotypes and transmissibility in experimental infections of a GLV naive Giardia isolate.
PXD013933	34201883	Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomic and Immunoproteomic Analyses of the Candida albicans Hyphal Secretome Reveal Diagnostic Biomarker Candidates for Invasive Candidiasis. 	Immunoproteomic study of Candida albicans hyphal secretome for the identification of diagnostic biomarker candidates of invasive candidiasis	Candida albicans, biomarkers, diagnosis, immunoproteomics	Invasive candidiasis (IC) is associated with high morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients if not diagnosed early. Long-term use of central venous catheters is a predisposing factor for IC. Hyphal forms of Candida albicans (the major etiological agent of IC) are related to invasion of host tissues. The secreted proteins of hyphae are involved in virulence, host interaction, immune response, and immune evasion. To identify IC diagnostic biomarker candidates, we characterized the C. albicans hyphal secretome by gel-free proteomic analysis, and further assessed the antibody-reactivity patterns to this subproteome in serum pools from 12 patients with non-catheter-associated IC (ncIC), 11 patients with catheter-associated IC (cIC), and 11 non-IC patients. We identified 301 secreted hyphal proteins stratified to stem from the extracellular region, cell wall, cell surface, or intracellular compartments. ncIC and cIC patients had higher antibody levels to the hyphal secretome than non-IC patients. Seven secreted hyphal proteins were identified to be immunogenic (Bgl2, Eno1, Pgk1, Glx3, Sap5, Pra1 and Tdh3). Antibody-reactivity patterns to Bgl2, Eno1, Pgk1 and Glx3 discriminated IC patients from non-IC patients, while those to Sap5, Pra1 and Tdh3 differentiated between cIC and non-IC patients. These proteins may be useful for development of future IC diagnostic tests.
PXD025534	34201891	Insights into Autotrophic Activities and Carbon Flow in Iron-Rich Pelagic Aggregates (Iron Snow). 	Insights into autotrophic activities and carbon flow in iron-rich pelagic aggregates (iron snow)	13C isotope, autotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria, heterotrophic iron reducing bacteria, iron snow, metaproteomics	Pelagic aggregates function as biological carbon pumps for transporting fixed organic carbon to sediments. In iron-rich (ferruginous) lakes, photoferrotrophic and chemolithoautotrophic bacteria contribute to CO2 fixation by oxidizing reduced iron, leading to the formation of iron-rich pelagic aggregates (iron snow). The significance of iron oxidizers in carbon fixation, their general role in iron snow functioning and the flow of carbon within iron snow is still unclear. Here, we combined a two-year metatranscriptome analysis of iron snow collected from an acidic lake with protein-based stable isotope probing to determine general metabolic activities and to trace (13)CO2 incorporation in iron snow over time under oxic and anoxic conditions. mRNA-derived metatranscriptome of iron snow identified four key players (Leptospirillum, Ferrovum, Acidithrix, Acidiphilium) with relative abundances (59.6-85.7%) encoding ecologically relevant pathways, including carbon fixation and polysaccharide biosynthesis. No transcriptional activity for carbon fixation from archaea or eukaryotes was detected. (13)CO2 incorporation studies identified active chemolithoautotroph Ferrovum under both conditions. Only 1.0-5.3% relative (13)C abundances were found in heterotrophic Acidiphilium and Acidocella under oxic conditions. These data show that iron oxidizers play an important role in CO2 fixation, but the majority of fixed C will be directly transported to the sediment without feeding heterotrophs in the water column in acidic ferruginous lakes.

Despite genomics and transcriptomics profiling efforts to understand AML's heterogeneity, studies focused on the proteomic profiles associated with pediatric AML cytogenetic features remain limited. Furthermore, the majority of biological functions within cells are operated by proteins (i.e., enzymes) and most drugs target the proteome rather than the genome or transcriptome, thus, highlighting the significance of studying proteomics. Here, we present our results from a pilot study investigating global proteomic profiles of leukemic cells obtained at diagnosis from 16 pediatric AML patients using a robust TMT-LC/LC-MS/MS platform. The proteome profiles were compared among patients with or without core binding factor (CBF) translocation indicated by a t(8;21) or inv(16) cytogenetic abnormality, minimal residual disease status at the end of the first cycle of chemotherapy (MRD1), and in vitro chemosensitivity of leukemic cells to cytarabine (Ara-C LC50). Our results established proteomic differences between CBF and non-CBF AML subtypes, providing insights to AML subtypes physiology, and identified potential druggable proteome targets such as THY1 (CD90), NEBL, CTSF, COL2A1, CAT, MGLL (MAGL), MACROH2A2, CLIP2 (isoform 1 and 2), ANPEP (CD13), MMP14, and AK5.

Here, a gel-free shotgun proteomics approach was used to identify the secreted proteins of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the mutualistic fungus Trichoderma atroviride during their interaction. A total of 126 proteins of Arabidopsis and 1027 of T. atroviride were identified. Among them, 118 and 780 were differentially modulated, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis unveiled that both organisms' secretomes were enriched with enzymes. In T. atroviride, glycosidases, aspartic endopeptidases, and dehydrogenases increased in response to Arabidopsis. Additionally, amidases, protein-serine/threonine kinases, and hydro-lyases showed decreased levels. Furthermore, peroxidases, cysteine endopeptidases, and enzymes related to the catabolism of secondary metabolites increased in the plant secretome. In contrast, pathogenesis-related proteins and protease inhibitors decreased in response to the fungus. Notably, the glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase GGAT1 was secreted by Arabidopsis during its interaction with T. atroviride. Our study showed that GGAT1 is partially required for plant growth stimulation and on the induction of the plant systemic resistance by T. atroviride. Additionally, GGAT1 seems to participate in the negative regulation of the plant systemic resistance against B. cinerea through a mechanism involving H2O2 production.
PXD024478	34203326	Cockayne Syndrome-Associated CSA and CSB Mutations Impair Ribosome Biogenesis, Ribosomal Protein Stability, and Global Protein Folding. 	RNA polymerase I transcription disturbances lead to instable ribosomes in Cockayne syndrome	Cockayne syndrome, RNA polymerase I, loss of proteostasis, ribosome, translational fidelity	Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a developmental disorder with symptoms that are typical for the aging body, including subcutaneous fat loss, alopecia, and cataracts. Here, we show that in the cells of CS patients, RNA polymerase I transcription and the processing of the pre-rRNA are disturbed, leading to an accumulation of the 18S-E intermediate. The mature 18S rRNA level is reduced, and isolated ribosomes lack specific ribosomal proteins of the small 40S subunit. Ribosomal proteins are susceptible to unfolding and the CS cell proteome is heat-sensitive, indicating misfolded proteins and an error-prone translation process in CS cells. Pharmaceutical chaperones restored impaired cellular proliferation. Therefore, we provide evidence for severe protein synthesis malfunction, which together with a loss of proteostasis constitutes the underlying pathophysiology in CS.
PXD022133	34204832	Proteome Profiling of PMJ2-R and Primary Peritoneal Macrophages. 	Proteome profiling of PMJ2-R and primary peritoneal macrophages	PMJ2-R, peritoneal macrophages, phagocytosis	In vitro models are often used for studying macrophage functions, including the process of phagocytosis. The application of primary macrophages has limitations associated with the individual characteristics of animals, which can lead to insufficient standardization and higher variability of the obtained results. Immortalized cell lines do not have these disadvantages, but their responses to various signals can differ from those of the living organism. In the present study, a comparative proteomic analysis of immortalized PMJ2-R cell line and primary peritoneal macrophages isolated from C57BL/6 mice was performed. A total of 4005 proteins were identified, of which 797 were quantified. Obtained results indicate significant differences in the abundances of many proteins, including essential proteins associated with the process of phagocytosis, such as Elmo1, Gsn, Hspa8, Itgb1, Ncf2, Rac2, Rack1, Sirpa, Sod1, C3, and Msr1. These findings indicate that outcomes of studies utilizing PMJ2-R cells as a model of peritoneal macrophages should be carefully validated. All MS data are deposited in ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD022133.
PXD006768	34207065	Omics Technologies to Decipher Regulatory Networks in Granulocytic Cell Differentiation. 	The Study of ATRA-Induced Differentiation of the HL-60 Cell Line	ATRA, HL60 cell line, differentiation, time-course study	Induced granulocytic differentiation of human leukemic cells under all-trans-retinoid acid (ATRA) treatment underlies differentiation therapy of acute myeloid leukemia. Knowing the regulation of this process it is possible to identify potential targets for antileukemic drugs and develop novel approaches to differentiation therapy. In this study, we have performed transcriptomic and proteomic profiling to reveal up- and down-regulated transcripts and proteins during time-course experiments. Using data on differentially expressed transcripts and proteins we have applied upstream regulator search and obtained transcriptome- and proteome-based regulatory networks of induced granulocytic differentiation that cover both up-regulated (HIC1, NFKBIA, and CASP9) and down-regulated (PARP1, VDR, and RXRA) elements. To verify the designed network we measured HIC1 and PARP1 protein abundance during granulocytic differentiation by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) using stable isotopically labeled peptide standards. We also revealed that transcription factor CEBPB and LYN kinase were involved in differentiation onset, and evaluated their protein levels by SRM technique. Obtained results indicate that the omics data reflect involvement of the DNA repair system and the MAPK kinase cascade as well as show the balance between the processes of the cell survival and apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. The differentially expressed transcripts and proteins, predicted transcriptional factors, and key molecules such as HIC1, CEBPB, LYN, and PARP1 may be considered as potential targets for differentiation therapy of acute myeloid leukemia.
PXD025154	34207776	Differential Exoproteome and Biochemical Characterisation of Neoparamoeba perurans. 	Differential exoproteome and biochemical characterisation of Neoparamoeba perurans	AGD, Neoparamaeba perurans, exoproteome	Infection with the protozoan ectoparasite Neoparamoeba perurans, the causative agent of AGD, remains a global threat to salmonid farming. This study aimed to analyse the exoproteome of both an attenuated and virulent N. perurans isolate using proteomics and cytotoxicity testing. A disproportionate presence of proteins from the co-cultured microbiota of N. perurans was revealed on searching an amalgamated database of bacterial, N. perurans and Amoebozoa proteins. LC-MS/MS identified 33 differentially expressed proteins, the majority of which were upregulated in the attenuated exoproteome. Proteins of putative interest found in both exoproteomes were maltoporin, ferrichrome-iron receptor, and putative ferric enterobactin receptor. Protease activity remained significantly elevated in the attenuated exoproteome compared with the virulent exoproteome. Similarly, the attenuated exoproteome had a significantly higher cytotoxic effect on rainbow trout gill cell line (RTgill W1) cells compared with the virulent exoproteome. The presence of a phosphatase and serine protease in the virulent exoproteome may facilitate AGD infection but do not appear to be key players in causing cytotoxicity. Altogether, this study reveals prolonged culture of N. perurans affects the exoproteome composition in favour of nutritional acquisition, and that the current culturing protocol for virulent N. perurans does not facilitate the secretion of virulence factors.
PXD026116	34207861	Rintatolimod Induces Antiviral Activities in Human Pancreatic Cancer Cells: Opening for an Anti-COVID-19 Opportunity in Cancer Patients? 	Rintatolimod induces antiviral activities in human pancreatic cancer cells: opening for an anti-COVID-19 opportunity in cancer patients?	Covid-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19	Severe acute respiratory virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally leading to a devastating loss of life. Large registry studies have begun to shed light on the epidemiological and clinical vulnerabilities of cancer patients who succumb to or endure poor outcomes of SARS-CoV-2. Specific treatment for COVID-19 infections in cancer patients is lacking while the demand for treatment is increasing. Therefore, we explored the effect of Rintatolimod (Ampligen((R))) (AIM ImmunoTech, Ocala, FL, USA), a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist, to treat uninfected human pancreatic cancer cells (HPACs). The direct effect of Rintatolimod was measured by targeted gene expression profiling and by proteomics measurements. Our results show that Rintatolimod induces an antiviral effect in HPACs by inducing RNase-L-dependent and independent pathways of the innate immune system. Treatment with Rintatolimod activated the interferon signaling pathway, leading to the overexpression of several cytokines and chemokines in epithelial cells. Furthermore, Rintatolimod treatment increased the expression of angiogenesis-related genes without promoting fibrosis, which is the main cause of death in patients with COVID-19. We conclude that Rintatolimod could be considered an early additional treatment option for cancer patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 to prevent the complicated severity of the disease.
PXD025922	34208790	Proteomics Analysis Reveals Diverse Molecular Characteristics between Endocardial and Aortic-Valvular Endothelium. 	Protein profiling of Aortic-Valvular and Endocardial endothelial cells using label-free proteomics	Aortic-valvular (AVE), Endocardial endothelial (EE) cells	The variations in the protein profile of aortic-valvular (AVE) and endocardial endothelial (EE) cells are currently unknown. The current study's objective is to identify differentially expressed proteins and associated pathways in both the endothelial cells. We used endothelial cells isolated from the porcine (Sus scrofa) aortic valve and endocardium for the profiling of proteins. Label-free proteomics was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Our proteomics analysis revealed that 29 proteins were highly expressed, and 25 proteins were less expressed in the valve than the endocardial endothelium. The cell surface markers, such as CD63, ICAM1, PECAM1, PROCR, and TFRC, were highly expressed in EE. In contrast, CD44 was highly expressed in AVE. The pathway analysis showed that metabolic process-related proteins and extracellular matrix-related proteins were enriched in valves. Differential enrichment of signaling pathways was observed in the endocardium. The hemostasis function-related proteins were increased in both endothelial cells. The proteins and pathways enriched in aortic-valvular and endocardial endothelial cells revealed the distinct phenotype of these two closely related cells.
PXD026669	34209806	Identification of Nrl1 Domains Responsible for Interactions with RNA-Processing Factors and Regulation of Nrl1 Function by Phosphorylation. 	Mechanisms Regulating the Function of Spliceosome-Associated Factor Nrl1 of the Fission Yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe	Cka1, Nrl1, fission yeast, phosphorylation, pre-mRNA splicing, protein-protein interactions	Pre-mRNA splicing is a key process in the regulation of gene expression. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Nrl1 regulates splicing and expression of several genes and non-coding RNAs, and also suppresses the accumulation of R-loops. Here, we report analysis of interactions between Nrl1 and selected RNA-processing proteins and regulation of Nrl1 function by phosphorylation. Bacterial two-hybrid system (BACTH) assays revealed that the N-terminal region of Nrl1 is important for the interaction with ATP-dependent RNA helicase Mtl1 while the C-terminal region of Nrl1 is important for interactions with spliceosome components Ctr1, Ntr2, and Syf3. Consistent with this result, tandem affinity purification showed that Mtl1, but not Ctr1, Ntr2, or Syf3, co-purifies with the N-terminal region of Nrl1. Interestingly, mass-spectrometry analysis revealed that in addition to previously identified phosphorylation sites, Nrl1 is also phosphorylated on serines 86 and 112, and that Nrl1-TAP co-purifies with Cka1, the catalytic subunit of casein kinase 2. In vitro assay showed that Cka1 can phosphorylate bacterially expressed Nrl1 fragments. An analysis of non-phosphorylatable nrl1 mutants revealed defects in gene expression and splicing consistent with the notion that phosphorylation is an important regulator of Nrl1 function. Taken together, our results provide insights into two mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of the spliceosome-associated factor Nrl1, namely domain-specific interactions between Nrl1 and RNA-processing proteins and post-translational modification of Nrl1 by phosphorylation.
PXD026576	34209958	Perturbations of the Proteome and of Secreted Metabolites in Primary Astrocytes from the hSOD1(G93A) ALS Mouse Model. 	Perturbations of the proteome in primary astrocytes from the hSOD1(G93A) ALS mouse model	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, LC-HRMS/MS, Spinal cord astrocytes	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease whose pathophysiology is largely unknown. Despite the fact that motor neuron (MN) death is recognized as the key event in ALS, astrocytes dysfunctionalities and neuroinflammation were demonstrated to accompany and probably even drive MN loss. Nevertheless, the mechanisms priming astrocyte failure and hyperactivation are still obscure. In this work, altered pathways and molecules in ALS astrocytes were unveiled by investigating the proteomic profile and the secreted metabolome of primary spinal cord astrocytes derived from transgenic ALS mouse model overexpressing the human (h)SOD1(G93A) protein in comparison with the transgenic counterpart expressing hSOD1(WT) protein. Here we show that ALS primary astrocytes are depleted of proteins-and of secreted metabolites-involved in glutathione metabolism and signaling. The observed increased activation of Nf-kB, Ebf1, and Plag1 transcription factors may account for the augmented expression of proteins involved in the proteolytic routes mediated by proteasome or endosome-lysosome systems. Moreover, hSOD1(G93A) primary astrocytes also display altered lipid metabolism. Our results provide novel insights into the altered molecular pathways that may underlie astrocyte dysfunctionalities and altered astrocyte-MN crosstalk in ALS, representing potential therapeutic targets to abrogate or slow down MN demise in disease pathogenesis.
PXD024851	34210959	Display of the human mucinome with defined O-glycans by gene engineered cells. 	Display of the Human Mucinome with Defined O-Glycans by Gene Engineered Cells	Glycosylation, Intact Mass, Mucin, OrbiTrap	Mucins are a large family of heavily O-glycosylated proteins that cover all mucosal surfaces and constitute the major macromolecules in most body fluids. Mucins are primarily defined by their variable tandem repeat (TR) domains that are densely decorated with different O-glycan structures in distinct patterns, and these arguably convey much of the informational content of mucins. Here, we develop a cell-based platform for the display and production of human TR O-glycodomains (~200 amino acids) with tunable structures and patterns of O-glycans using membrane-bound and secreted reporters expressed in glycoengineered HEK293 cells. Availability of defined mucin TR O-glycodomains advances experimental studies into the versatile role of mucins at the interface with pathogenic microorganisms and the microbiome, and sparks new strategies for molecular dissection of specific roles of adhesins, glycoside hydrolases, glycopeptidases, viruses and other interactions with mucin TRs as highlighted by examples.
PXD013414	34210973	ATR regulates neuronal activity by modulating presynaptic firing. 	Role of ATR in mitochondrial functions and metabolism	ATR, metabolism, mitochondrial function	Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein, as a key DNA damage response (DDR) regulator, plays an essential function in response to replication stress and controls cell viability. Hypomorphic mutations of ATR cause the human ATR-Seckel syndrome, characterized by microcephaly and intellectual disability, which however suggests a yet unknown role for ATR in non-dividing cells. Here we show that ATR deletion in postmitotic neurons does not compromise brain development and formation; rather it enhances intrinsic neuronal activity resulting in aberrant firing and an increased epileptiform activity, which increases the susceptibility of ataxia and epilepsy in mice. ATR deleted neurons exhibit hyper-excitability, associated with changes in action potential conformation and presynaptic vesicle accumulation, independent of DDR signaling. Mechanistically, ATR interacts with synaptotagmin 2 (SYT2) and, without ATR, SYT2 is highly upregulated and aberrantly translocated to excitatory neurons in the hippocampus, thereby conferring a hyper-excitability. This study identifies a physiological function of ATR, beyond its DDR role, in regulating neuronal activity.
PXD022048	34211188	Meta-analysis defines principles for the design and analysis of co-fractionation mass spectrometry experiments. 	Systematic reanalysis of co-fractionation mass spectrometry data	CF-MS	Co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS) has emerged as a powerful technique for interactome mapping. However, there is little consensus on optimal strategies for the design of CF-MS experiments or their computational analysis. Here, we reanalyzed a total of 206 CF-MS experiments to generate a uniformly processed resource containing over 11 million measurements of protein abundance. We used this resource to benchmark experimental designs for CF-MS studies and systematically optimize computational approaches to network inference. We then applied this optimized methodology to reconstruct a draft-quality human interactome by CF-MS and predict over 700,000 protein-protein interactions across 27 eukaryotic species or clades. Our work defines new resources to illuminate proteome organization over evolutionary timescales and establishes best practices for the design and analysis of CF-MS studies.
PXD025886	34211961	Site-Specific N- and O-Glycosylation Analysis of Human Plasma Fibronectin. 	Site-specific N- and O-glycosylation Analysis of Human Plasma Fibronectin	Fibronectin, OpeRator, glycosylation, mass spectrometer, stepped normalized collision energy	Human plasma fibronectin is an adhesive protein that plays a crucial role in wound healing. Many studies had indicated that glycans might mediate the expression and functions of fibronectin, yet a comprehensive understanding of its glycosylation is still missing. Here, we performed a comprehensive N- and O-glycosylation mapping of human plasma fibronectin and quantified the occurrence of each glycoform in a site-specific manner. Intact N-glycopeptides were enriched by zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction chromatography, and N-glycosite sites were localized by the (18)O-labeling method. O-glycopeptide enrichment and O-glycosite identification were achieved by an enzyme-assisted site-specific extraction method. An RP-LC-MS/MS system functionalized with collision-induced dissociation and stepped normalized collision energy (sNCE)-HCD tandem mass was applied to analyze the glycoforms of fibronectin. A total of 6 N-glycosites and 53 O-glycosites were identified, which were occupied by 38 N-glycoforms and 16 O-glycoforms, respectively. Furthermore, 77.31% of N-glycans were sialylated, and O-glycosylation was dominated by the sialyl-T antigen. These site-specific glycosylation patterns on human fibronectin can facilitate functional analyses of fibronectin and therapeutics development.
PXD018960	34212546	Antibiotic-Dependent Relationships Between the Nasal Microbiome and Secreted Proteome in Nasal Polyps. 	In-depth proteomic analysis of nasal fluids from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps by data-independent acqusition	CRS, Data independent acqusition, Nasal fluids	PURPOSE: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory condition of the paranasal sinuses and nasal passages. Although antibiotics are used to reduce inflammation or to treat an episode of acute rhinosinusitis, their effects on the nasal environment and host response in CRS is unclear. METHODS: We analyzed the effects of antibiotics on the nasal microbiome and secreted proteome in CRS using multi-omic analysis. Nasal secretions were collected from 29 controls, 30 CRS patients without nasal polyps (NP), and 40 CRS patients with NP. A total of 99 subjects were divided into 2 groups that included subjects who had taken antibiotics 3 months prior to sampling and those who had not. We performed 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analyses and Orbitrap mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses. Spearman correlation was used to assess the correlations between the nasal microbiome and secreted proteome. RESULTS: The associations between the nasal microbiome and secreted proteome were noted in subjects who had used antibiotics. Antibiotics could have stronger effects on their associations in patients with CRS with NP than in those without. It remains unknown whether these holistic changes caused by antibiotics are beneficial or harmful to CRS, however, the associations could be differentially affected by disease severity. CONCLUSION: These findings provide new insight into the nasal environment and the host response in CRS.
PXD025053	34214177	Phosphorylation of the HP1beta hinge region sequesters KAP1 in heterochromatin and promotes the exit from naive pluripotency. 	ChIP-MS of HP1-beta (CBX1) and ubiquitylome of KAP1 (TRIM28) in mESCs	Phase separation, chromatin structure, chromocenter, heterochromatin, pluripotency exit	Heterochromatin binding protein HP1beta plays an important role in chromatin organization and cell differentiation, however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we generated HP1beta-/- embryonic stem cells and observed reduced heterochromatin clustering and impaired differentiation. We found that during stem cell differentiation, HP1beta is phosphorylated at serine 89 by CK2, which creates a binding site for the pluripotency regulator KAP1. This phosphorylation dependent sequestration of KAP1 in heterochromatin compartments causes a downregulation of pluripotency factors and triggers pluripotency exit. Accordingly, HP1beta-/- and phospho-mutant cells exhibited impaired differentiation, while ubiquitination-deficient KAP1-/- cells had the opposite phenotype with enhanced differentiation. These results suggest that KAP1 regulates pluripotency via its ubiquitination activity. We propose that the formation of subnuclear membraneless heterochromatin compartments may serve as a dynamic reservoir to trap or release cellular factors. The sequestration of essential regulators defines a novel and active role of heterochromatin in gene regulation and represents a dynamic mode of remote control to regulate cellular processes like cell fate decisions.
PXD012009	34214469	An atlas of protein-protein interactions across mouse tissues. 	An atlas of protein-protein interactions across mouse tissues	interactome	Cellular processes arise from the dynamic organization of proteins in networks of physical interactions. Mapping the interactome has therefore been a central objective of high-throughput biology. However, the dynamics of protein interactions across physiological contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a quantitative proteomic approach combining protein correlation profiling with stable isotope labeling of mammals (PCP-SILAM) to map the interactomes of seven mouse tissues. The resulting maps provide a proteome-scale survey of interactome rewiring across mammalian tissues, revealing more than 125,000 unique interactions at a quality comparable to the highest-quality human screens. We identify systematic suppression of cross-talk between the evolutionarily ancient housekeeping interactome and younger, tissue-specific modules. Rewired proteins are tightly regulated by multiple cellular mechanisms and are implicated in disease. Our study opens up new avenues to uncover regulatory mechanisms that shape in vivo interactome responses to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli in mammalian systems.
PXD025703	34214498	Famotidine inhibits toll-like receptor 3-mediated inflammatory signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection. 	Famotidine targets Toll-like receptor 3 signaling in SARS-CoV2 infection	Famotidine, SARS-CoV2, Toll-like receptor, anti-viral signaling, histamine	Apart from prevention using vaccinations, the management options for COVID-19 remain limited. In retrospective cohort studies, use of famotidine, a specific oral H2 receptor antagonist (antihistamine), has been associated with reduced risk of intubation and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In a case series, nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 experienced rapid symptom resolution after taking famotidine, but the molecular basis of these observations remains elusive. Here we show using biochemical, cellular, and functional assays that famotidine has no effect on viral replication or viral protease activity. However, famotidine can affect histamine-induced signaling processes in infected Caco2 cells. Specifically, famotidine treatment inhibits histamine-induced expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and can reduce TLR3-dependent signaling processes that culminate in activation of IRF3 and the NF-kappaB pathway, subsequently controlling antiviral and inflammatory responses. SARS-CoV-2-infected cells treated with famotidine demonstrate reduced expression levels of the inflammatory mediators CCL-2 and IL6, drivers of the cytokine release syndrome that precipitates poor outcome for patients with COVID-19. Given that pharmacokinetic studies indicate that famotidine can reach concentrations in blood that suffice to antagonize histamine H2 receptors expressed in mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils, these observations explain how famotidine may contribute to the reduced histamine-induced inflammation and cytokine release, thereby improving the outcome for patients with COVID-19.
PXD017065	34215303	SETD7-mediated monomethylation is enriched on soluble Tau in Alzheimer's disease. 	Tau posttranslational modifications	Alzheimers disease, PTM, Tau, lysine methylation	BACKGROUND: Human tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by alterations in the post-translational modification (PTM) pattern of Tau, which parallel the formation of insoluble Tau aggregates, neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. While PTMs on aggregated Tau have been studied in detail, much less is known about the modification patterns of soluble Tau. Furthermore, PTMs other than phosphorylation have only come into focus recently and are still understudied. Soluble Tau species are likely responsible for the spreading of pathology during disease progression and are currently being investigated as targets for immunotherapies. A better understanding of their biochemical properties is thus of high importance. METHODS: We used a mass spectrometry approach to characterize Tau PTMs on a detergent-soluble fraction of human AD and control brain tissue, which led to the discovery of novel lysine methylation events. We developed specific antibodies against Tau methylated at these sites and biochemically characterized methylated Tau species in extracts from human brain, the rTg4510 mouse model and in hiPSC-derived neurons. RESULTS: Our study demonstrates that methylated Tau levels increase with Tau pathology stage in human AD samples as well as in a mouse model of Tauopathy. Methylated Tau is enriched in soluble brain extracts and is not associated with hyperphosphorylated, high molecular weight Tau species. We also show that in hiPSC-derived neurons and mouse brain, methylated Tau preferentially localizes to the cell soma and nuclear fractions and is absent from neurites. Knock down and inhibitor studies supported by proteomics data led to the identification of SETD7 as a novel lysine methyltransferase for Tau. SETD7 specifically methylates Tau at K132, an event that facilitates subsequent methylation at K130. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that methylated Tau has a specific somatic and nuclear localization, suggesting that the methylation of soluble Tau species may provide a signal for their translocation to different subcellular compartments. Since the mislocalization and depletion of Tau from axons is associated with tauopathies, our findings may shed light onto this disease-associated phenomenon.
PXD026208	34215745	SS18 regulates pluripotent-somatic transition through phase separation. 	SS18 regulates pluripotent-somatic transition through phase separation	BAF complex, SS18, cell fate determination, mouse embryonic stem cells, phase separation	The transition from pluripotent to somatic states marks a critical event in mammalian development, but remains largely unresolved. Here we report the identification of SS18 as a regulator for pluripotent to somatic transition or PST by CRISPR-based whole genome screens. Mechanistically, SS18 forms microscopic condensates in nuclei through a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) rich in tyrosine, which, once mutated, no longer form condensates nor rescue SS18(-/-) defect in PST. Yet, the IDR alone is not sufficient to rescue the defect even though it can form condensates indistinguishable from the wild type protein. We further show that its N-terminal 70aa is required for PST by interacting with the Brg/Brahma-associated factor (BAF) complex, and remains functional even swapped onto unrelated IDRs or even an artificial 24 tyrosine polypeptide. Finally, we show that SS18 mediates BAF assembly through phase separation to regulate PST. These studies suggest that SS18 plays a role in the pluripotent to somatic interface and undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation through a unique tyrosine-based mechanism.
PXD004518	34215750	Redirected nuclear glutamate dehydrogenase supplies Tet3 with alpha-ketoglutarate in neurons. 	Redirected nuclear glutamate dehydrogenase supplies Tet3 with a-ketoglutarate in neurons	Tet3, alpha-ketoglutarate, citric acid cycle, epigenetics, hmC, isocitrate, oxaloacetate	Tet3 is the main alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG)-dependent dioxygenase in neurons that converts 5-methyl-dC into 5-hydroxymethyl-dC and further on to 5-formyl- and 5-carboxy-dC. Neurons possess high levels of 5-hydroxymethyl-dC that further increase during neural activity to establish transcriptional plasticity required for learning and memory functions. How alphaKG, which is mainly generated in mitochondria as an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is made available in the nucleus has remained an unresolved question in the connection between metabolism and epigenetics. We show that in neurons the mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which converts glutamate into alphaKG in an NAD(+)-dependent manner, is redirected to the nucleus by the alphaKG-consumer protein Tet3, suggesting on-site production of alphaKG. Further, glutamate dehydrogenase has a stimulatory effect on Tet3 demethylation activity in neurons, and neuronal activation increases the levels of alphaKG. Overall, the glutamate dehydrogenase-Tet3 interaction might have a role in epigenetic changes during neural plasticity.
PXD027020	34215846	Global identification of phospho-dependent SCF substrates reveals a FBXO22 phosphodegron and an ERK-FBXO22-BAG3 axis in tumorigenesis. 	Global identification ofphospho-dependent SCF ubiquitin ligase substrate reveal a role of ERK-FBXO22-BAG3 axis in tumorigenesis	MLN4924, Phosphoproteomics	SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligases play fundamental roles in cellular functions. Typically, substrate phosphorylation is required for SCF recognition and subsequent degradation. However, phospho-dependent substrates remain largely unidentified. Here, using quantitative phoshoproteome approach, we performed a system-wide investigation of phospho-dependent SCF substrates. This strategy identified diverse phospho-dependent candidates. Biochemical verification revealed a mechanism by which SCF(FBXO22) recognizes the motif XXPpSPXPXX as a conserved phosphodegron to target substrates for destruction. We further demonstrated BAG3, a HSP70 co-chaperone, is a bona fide substrate of SCF(FBXO22). FBXO22 mediates BAG3 ubiquitination and degradation that requires ERK-dependent BAG3 phosphorylation at S377. FBXO22 depletion or expression of a stable BAG3 S377A mutant promotes tumor growth via defects in apoptosis and cell cycle progression in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study identified broad phosphorylation-dependent SCF substrates and demonstrated a phosphodegron recognized by FBXO22 and a novel ERK-FBXO22-BAG3 axis involved in tumorigenesis.
PXD026038	34216810	iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics suggests mitophagy involvement after Rice black-streaked dwarf virus acquisition in insect vector small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus Fallen. 	iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics suggests mitophagy involvement after Rice black-streaked dwarf virus acquisition in insect vector small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus Fallén	Rice black-streaked dwarf virus, Tobacco, iTRAQ	Plant viruses trigger numerous responses in their insect vectors. Using iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis, early responses of the insect vector, the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus Fallen, SBPH), after acquiring Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) at 3 days and 5 days post first access to diseased plants (padp) were revealed. A total of 582 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in SBPH with a fold change >1.500 or <0.667 (p-value < 0.05) were identified. The proteomic analysis in SBPH at 3 days padp revealed 106 highly abundant proteins and 193 of low abundance, while 5 days padp revealed 214 highly abundant proteins and 182 of low abundance. Among them, 51 highly abundant proteins and 42 of low abundance were shown consistently at both 3 days and 5 days padp. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis mapping and Gene Ontology (GO) term classification suggested impairment of mitochondria in SBPH after RBSDV acquisition, and the 77 out of 582 differentially abundant SBPH proteins analyzed by the STRING program revealed the interaction network of the mitochondrial DAPs, showing an overall down-regulation of mitochondrial proteins including the electron transport chain proteins and mitochondrial ribosome proteins. The high abundance of Parkin at 5 days padp suggests that activation of mitophagy induced degradation of mitochondria occurred. Further verification of autophagy/mitophagy-related genes by reverse-transcription quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) in SBPH after RBSDV acquisition showed up-regulation of the autophagy receptors Optineurin (OPTN), Sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1, also known as p62) and Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) which targets ubiquitinated damaged mitochondria during mitophagy. The phosphorylation of the three autophagy receptors may be up-regulated through an increase of transcription level TRAF-associated NFkappaB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). As a result, an overall reduction in the abundance of mitochondrial proteins was observed and the selective autophagic degradation was up-regulated through increased transcription level of OPTN, p62/SQSTM1, TAX1BP1 and TBK1. Therefore, acquisition of RBSDV associated with up-regulated autophagy and selective mitochondrial degradation in SBPH suggest prevention of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis and extension of the vector life span. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: RBSDV causes severe yield loss in rice plants. RBSDV is transmitted efficiently only through SBPH. It is important to understand how RBSDV infects SBPH in a persistent, circulative and propagative manner. However, there has been no study on the interaction between RBSDV and SBPH at the early acquisition stage using a proteomics approach. In this study, we combined iTRAQ technique and LC-MS/MS to analyze the vector proteomics at both the initial and latent infection stages after RBSDV acquisition and verified the results by RT-qPCR. Our results revealed that significantly low DAPs were involved in various pathways, including biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, ribosomes, carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids and TCA cycle. Further clustering of the DAPs revealed significant changes in SBPH mitochondria, including decreased proteins in mitochondrial ribosomes and electron transport chain complex I, II and V. On the other hand, there was a high abundance of Parkin, suggesting the occurrence of mitochondria damage and subsequent Parkin-mediated mitophagy for clearance of impaired mitochondria. Moreover, the decreased level of PMPCB in terms of gene expression and protein abundance suggested decreased PINK1 turnover, promoting Parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy. Further analysis on autophagy/mitophagy-related gene transcription level indicated up-regulation of OPTN, p62/SQSTM1, TAX1BP1 and TBK1, promoting selective autophagy in SBPH after RBSDV acquisition. These findings provided new insights into the effects of RBSDV on SBPH after early acquisition by selective degradation of mitochondria, especially on reprogramming of energy metabolism and decreased mitochondria biogenesis, to prevent apoptosis and prolong the life span of SBPH post virus acquisition.
PXD003549	34217309	ALKBH3 partner ASCC3 mediates P-body formation and selective clearance of MMS-induced 1-methyladenosine and 3-methylcytosine from mRNA. 	Identifying proteins altered during Methyl methanesulfonate treatment	DNA damage, SILAC, label-free, methyl methanesulfonate, prbitrap, quantification	BACKGROUND: Reversible enzymatic methylation of mammalian mRNA is widespread and serves crucial regulatory functions, but little is known to what degree chemical alkylators mediate overlapping modifications and whether cells distinguish aberrant from canonical methylations. METHODS: Here we use quantitative mass spectrometry to determine the fate of chemically induced methylbases in the mRNA of human cells. Concomitant alteration in the mRNA binding proteome was analyzed by SILAC mass spectrometry. RESULTS: MMS induced prominent direct mRNA methylations that were chemically identical to endogenous methylbases. Transient loss of 40S ribosomal proteins from isolated mRNA suggests that aberrant methylbases mediate arrested translational initiation and potentially also no-go decay of the affected mRNA. Four proteins (ASCC3, YTHDC2, TRIM25 and GEMIN5) displayed increased mRNA binding after MMS treatment. ASCC3 is a binding partner of the DNA/RNA demethylase ALKBH3 and was recently shown to promote disassembly of collided ribosomes as part of the ribosome quality control (RQC) trigger complex. We find that ASCC3-deficient cells display delayed removal of MMS-induced 1-methyladenosine (m(1)A) and 3-methylcytosine (m(3)C) from mRNA and impaired formation of MMS-induced P-bodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings conform to a model in which ASCC3-mediated disassembly of collided ribosomes allows demethylation of aberrant m(1)A and m(3)C by ALKBH3. Our findings constitute first evidence of selective sanitation of aberrant mRNA methylbases over their endogenous counterparts and warrant further studies on RNA-mediated effects of chemical alkylators commonly used in the clinic.
PXD021653	34218486	Dysregulated protein phosphorylation: A determining condition in the continuum of brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. 	Brain proteome analysis in Alzheimer's disease	Alzheimers disease, phosphoproteomics	Tau hyperphosphorylation is the first step of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation. In the present study, samples of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and frontal cortex area 8 (FC) of cases with NFT pathology classified as stages I-II, III-IV, and V-VI without comorbidities, and of middle-aged (MA) individuals with no NFT pathology, were analyzed by conventional label-free and SWATH-MS (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry) to assess the (phospho)proteomes. The total number of identified dysregulated phosphoproteins was 214 in the EC, 65 of which were dysregulated at the first stages (I-II) of NFT pathology; 167 phosphoproteins were dysregulated in the FC, 81 of them at stages I-II of NFT pathology. A large percentage of dysregulated phosphoproteins were identified in the two regions and at different stages of NFT progression. The main group of dysregulated phosphoproteins was made up of components of the membranes, cytoskeleton, synapses, proteins linked to membrane transport and ion channels, and kinases. The present results show abnormal phosphorylation of proteins at the first stages of NFT pathology in the elderly (in individuals clinically considered representative of normal aging) and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD). Dysregulated protein phosphorylation in the FC precedes the formation of NFTs and SPs. The most active period of dysregulated phosphorylation is at stages III-IV when a subpopulation of individuals might be clinically categorized as suffering from mild cognitive impairment which is a preceding determinant stage in the progression to dementia. Altered phosphorylation of selected proteins, carried out by activation of several kinases, may alter membrane and cytoskeletal functions, among them synaptic transmission and membrane/cytoskeleton signaling. Besides their implications in sAD, the present observations suggest a molecular substrate for "benign" cognitive deterioration in "normal" brain aging.
PXD030347	34220420	Photoacoustic Neuroimaging - Perspectives on a Maturing Imaging Technique and its Applications in Neuroscience. 	Integrated metabolomics and proteomics analysis of urine in a mouse model of Posttraumatic stress disorder	Mice, PTSD model, Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Urine	A prominent goal of neuroscience is to improve our understanding of how brain structure and activity interact to produce perception, emotion, behavior, and cognition. The brain's network activity is inherently organized in distinct spatiotemporal patterns that span scales from nanometer-sized synapses to meter-long nerve fibers and millisecond intervals between electrical signals to decades of memory storage. There is currently no single imaging method that alone can provide all the relevant information, but intelligent combinations of complementary techniques can be effective. Here, we thus present the latest advances in biomedical and biological engineering on photoacoustic neuroimaging in the context of complementary imaging techniques. A particular focus is placed on recent advances in whole-brain photoacoustic imaging in rodent models and its influential role in bridging the gap between fluorescence microscopy and more non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We consider current strategies to address persistent challenges, particularly in developing molecular contrast agents, and conclude with an overview of potential future directions for photoacoustic neuroimaging to provide deeper insights into healthy and pathological brain processes.
PXD023819	34220748	Pathological Features of Enterovirus 71-Associated Brain and Lung Damage in Mice Based on Quantitative Proteomic Analysis. 	Pathological Features of Enterovirus 71-associated Brain and Lung Damage in Mice Based on Quantitative Proteomic Analyses	central nervous system, complement and coagulation cascade, enterovirus 71, pulmonary edema, quantitative proteomics, type I IFN response	The outbreaks of enterovirus 71 (EV71)-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) have emerged as an emergency of global health due to its association with fatal encephalitis and subsequent neurogenic pulmonary edema; however, the molecular characteristics and pathological features underlying EV71-associated encephalitis and pulmonary edema remain largely unknown. In this study, we performed a proteomic analysis of fresh brain and lung tissues from EV71-infected mice at 7 days post infection. We detected a perturbed expression of 148 proteins in the brain and 78 proteins in the lung after EV71 expression. Further analysis showed that the dysregulated proteins in the brain are involved in a variety of fundamental biological pathways, including complement and coagulation cascades, innate and adaptive immune responses, platelet activation, and nitrogen metabolism, and those proteins in the lung participate in innate and adaptive immune responses, phagosome, arginine biosynthesis, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 signaling pathway. Our results suggested that immune activation, complement and coagulation dysfunction, platelet activation, imbalance of nitrogen metabolism, and hypoxia could be involved in the pathogenesis of EV71, which explains the major clinical manifestation of hyperinflammatory status of severe HFMD cases. Our study provides further understanding of the molecular basis of EV71 pathogenesis.
PXD024515	34222036	GLUT3 as an Intersection of Glycerophospholipid Metabolism and the Innate Immune Response to Candida albicans. 	Proteomics of monocytes stimulated by Candida albicans	Human monocyte LC-MS/MS	Immune cells can optimize the management of metabolic resources to balance their energy requirements in order to regulate immune responses. The interconnection between immunometabolism and fungal infections is becoming increasingly apparent. Using proteome and metabolome assays, we found that stimulation of primary human monocytes by Candida albicans was accompanied by upregulation of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) and activation of the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. Upregulated GLUT3 expression has been preliminarily confirmed in monocytes from patients with C. albicans bloodstream infection. Our findings support the importance of GLUT3 in the complex network of glycerophospholipid metabolism and the innate immune responses against C. albicans. In summary, this study might contribute to decipher the regulatory mechanism between the monocyte metabolic reprogramming and innate immune response and reveal potential targets for the antifungal treatments.
PXD026436	34222219	High-Efficient Production of Adipose-Derived Stem Cell (ADSC) Secretome Through Maturation Process and Its Non-scarring Wound Healing Applications. 	Human adipose-derived stem cells secretome	ADSCs, Secretome, Serum-free	Recently, the stem cell-derived secretome, which is the set of proteins expressed by stem cells and secreted into the extracellular space, has been demonstrated as a critical contributor for tissue repair. In this study, we have produced two sets of high concentration secretomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) that contain bovine serum or free of exogenous molecules. Through proteomic analysis, we elucidated that proteins related to extracellular matrix organization and growth factor-related proteins are highly secreted by ADSCs. Additionally, the application of ADSC secretome to full skin defect showed accelerated wound closure, enhanced angiogenic response, and complete regeneration of epithelial gaps. Furthermore, the ADSC secretome was capable of reducing scar formation. Finally, we show high-dose injection of ADSC secretome via intraperitoneal or transdermal delivery demonstrated no detectable pathological conditions in various tissues/organs, which supports the notion that ADSC secretome can be safely utilized for tissue repair and regeneration.
PXD017700	34222397	Comparative Secretome Analyses of Mycoplasma bovis Virulent and Attenuated Strains Revealed MbovP0145 as a Promising Diagnostic Biomarker. 	Label-free based Proteomic analysis of secreted proteins from Mycoplasma bovis HB0801 and its attenuated strain P150	Mycoplasma bovis, label-free, secreted proteins	Mycoplasmas are successful pathogens both in humans as well as in animals. In cattle, Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) is known to be responsible for serious health complications, including pneumonia, mastitis, and arthritis. However, M. bovis pathogenesis remains unclear. Secreted proteins of M. bovis could influence infection and modify host defense signaling pathways after they enter their extracellular space in the host micro-environment. Therefore, this study was aimed to compare the secretomes of M. bovis HB0801 virulent (P1) and attenuated (P150) strains and identify potential pathogenesis-related secreted proteins and biomarkers. The cells of P1 and P150 strains were grown in pleuropneumonia-like organism medium to log phase and then transferred to phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h. Then, the supernatant was analyzed by using label-free quantitative proteomics, and 477 potential secreted proteins were identified. Combined with the bioinformatics prediction, we found that 178 proteins were commonly secreted by the P1 and P150 strains, and 49 of them were encoded by mycoplasmal core genes. Additionally, 79 proteins were found to have a different abundance between the P1 and P150 strains. Among these proteins, 34 were more abundant and uniquely expressed in P1, indicating a possible association with the virulence of M. bovis. Three differentially secreted proteins, MbovP0145, MbovP0725, and MbovP0174, as well as one equally secreted protein, MbovP0481, as positive control and one protein of inner membrane, MbovP0310, as negative control were, respectively, cloned, expressed, and evaluated for antigenicity, subcellular location, and the secretion nature with their mouse antisera by western blotting and colony immunoblotting assay. Among them, MbovP0145 was confirmed to be more secreted by P1 than P150 strain, highly reactive with the antisera from naturally infected and P1 experimentally infected cattle but not with the P150 vaccinated calves, indicating its potential as a diagnostic antigen. In conclusion, these findings may represent the most extensive compilation of potentially secreted proteins in mycoplasma species and the largest number of differentially secreted proteins between the virulent and attenuated M. bovis strains to date and provide new insights into M. bovis pathogenesis and diagnosis.
PXD012852	34223818	Novel LOTUS-domain proteins are organizational hubs that recruit C. elegans Vasa to germ granules. 	Protein-protein interactions of MEG-3 in C. elegans early embryos	AP-MS, C. elegans, GEI-12, MEG-3, PPI, early embryo	We describe MIP-1 and MIP-2, novel paralogous C. elegans germ granule components that interact with the intrinsically disordered MEG-3 protein. These proteins promote P granule condensation, form granules independently of MEG-3 in the postembryonic germ line, and balance each other in regulating P granule growth and localization. MIP-1 and MIP-2 each contain two LOTUS domains and intrinsically disordered regions and form homo- and heterodimers. They bind and anchor the Vasa homolog GLH-1 within P granules and are jointly required for coalescence of MEG-3, GLH-1, and PGL proteins. Animals lacking MIP-1 and MIP-2 show temperature-sensitive embryonic lethality, sterility, and mortal germ lines. Germline phenotypes include defects in stem cell self-renewal, meiotic progression, and gamete differentiation. We propose that these proteins serve as scaffolds and organizing centers for ribonucleoprotein networks within P granules that help recruit and balance essential RNA processing machinery to regulate key developmental transitions in the germ line.
PXD025527	34225054	Streptococcus equi-derived extracellular vesicles as a vaccine candidate against Streptococcus equi infection. 	Comprehensive proteomics for Discovery vaccine candidates against Streptococcus equi Infections	Extracellular Vesicle, Immunoprecipitation-MS, LC-MS, Label-free, Streptococcus equi	Streptococcus equi subspecies equi is a pathogenic bacterium that causes strangles, a highly contagious respiratory infection in horses and other equines. The limitations of current vaccines against S. equi infection warrants the development of an affordable, safe, and effective vaccine. Because gram-positive extracellular vesicles (EVs) transport various immunogenic antigens, they are attractive vaccine candidates. Here, we purified the EVs of S. equi ATCC 39506 and evaluated them as a vaccine candidate against S. equi infection in mice. As an initial step, comparative proteomic analysis was performed to characterize the functional features of the EVs. Reverse vaccinology and knowledge-based annotations were then used to screen potential vaccine candidates (PVCs) for S. equi ATCC 39506. Finally, 32 PVCs were found to be enriched in the EV fraction, suggesting the usefulness of this fraction as a vaccine. Importantly, a significantly higher survival rate after S. equi infection was detected in mice immunized with S. equi-derived EVs via the intraperitoneal route than in mice immunized with heat-killed bacteria. Of note, immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry results validated various immunogenic antigens within the EV proteome. In conclusion, our results suggest that S. equi-derived EVs can serve as a vaccine candidate against S. equi infection.
PXD023488	34226511	The proteolytic landscape of cells exposed to non-lethal stresses is shaped by executioner caspases. 	Non-lethal stress-induced discrete proteolysis is caspase-3/7 dependent	QExactive, apoptosis, proteolysis	Cells are in constant adaptation to environmental changes to insure their proper functioning. When exposed to stresses, cells activate specific pathways to elicit adaptive modifications. Those changes can be mediated by selective modulation of gene and protein expression as well as by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and proteolytic processing. Protein cleavage, as a controlled and limited post-translational modification, is involved in diverse physiological processes such as the maintenance of protein homeostasis, activation of repair pathways, apoptosis and the regulation of proliferation. Here we assessed by quantitative proteomics the proteolytic landscape in two cell lines subjected to low cisplatin concentrations used as a mild non-lethal stress paradigm. This landscape was compared to the one obtained in the same cells stimulated with cisplatin concentrations inducing apoptosis. These analyses were performed in wild-type cells and in cells lacking the two main executioner caspases: caspase-3 and caspase-7. Ninety-two proteins were found to be cleaved at one or a few sites (discrete cleavage) in low stress conditions compared to four hundred and fifty-three in apoptotic cells. Many of the cleaved proteins in stressed cells were also found to be cleaved in apoptotic conditions. As expected, ~90% of the cleavage events were dependent on caspase-3/caspase-7 in apoptotic cells. Strikingly, upon exposure to non-lethal stresses, no discrete cleavage was detected in cells lacking caspase-3 and caspase-7. This indicates that the proteolytic landscape in stressed viable cells fully depends on the activity of executioner caspases. These results suggest that the so-called executioner caspases fulfill important stress adaptive responses distinct from their role in apoptosis. Mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD023488.
PXD020903	34227026	Alteration of protein expression and spliceosome pathway activity during Barrett's carcinogenesis. 	Alteration of protein expression and spliceosome pathway activity during Barrett's carcinogenesis.	Barrett's esophagus, adenocarcinoma, bottom-up proteomics, dysplastia, epithelial cells, laser capture micro-dissection	BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a known precursor lesion and the strongest risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a common and lethal type of cancer. Prediction of risk, the basis for efficient intervention, is commonly solely based on histologic examination. This approach is challenged by problems such as inter-observer variability in the face of the high heterogeneity of dysplastic tissue. Molecular markers might offer an additional way to understand the carcinogenesis and improve the diagnosis-and eventually treatment. In this study, we probed significant proteomic changes during dysplastic progression from BE into EAC. METHODS: During endoscopic mucosa resection, epithelial and stromal tissue samples were collected by laser capture microdissection from 10 patients with normal BE and 13 patients with high-grade dysplastic/EAC. Samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Expressed proteins were determined by label-free quantitation, and gene set enrichment was used to find differentially expressed pathways. The results were validated by immunohistochemistry for two selected key proteins (MSH6 and XPO5). RESULTS: Comparing dysplastic/EAC to non-dysplastic BE, we found in equal volumes of epithelial tissue an overall up-regulation in terms of protein abundance and diversity, and determined a set of 226 differentially expressed proteins. Significantly higher expressions of MSH6 and XPO5 were validated orthogonally and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that disease-related proteomic alterations can be determined by analyzing minute amounts of cell-type-specific collected tissue. Further analysis indicated that alterations of certain pathways associated with carcinogenesis, such as micro-RNA trafficking, DNA damage repair, and spliceosome activity, exist in dysplastic/EAC.
PXD023884	34227939	Method development and characterisation of the low-molecular-weight peptidome of human wound fluids. 	Method development and characterization of the low molecular weight peptidome of human wound fluids	Peptidomics Orbitrap	The normal wound healing process is characterised by proteolytic events, whereas infection results in dysfunctional activations by endogenous and bacterial proteases. Peptides, downstream reporters of these proteolytic actions, could therefore serve as a promising tool for diagnosis of wounds. Using mass-spectrometry analyses, we here for the first time characterise the peptidome of human wound fluids. Sterile post-surgical wound fluids were found to contain a high degree of peptides in comparison to human plasma. Analyses of the peptidome from uninfected healing wounds and Staphylococcus aureus -infected wounds identify unique peptide patterns of various proteins, including coagulation and complement factors, proteases, and antiproteinases. Together, the work defines a workflow for analysis of peptides derived from wound fluids and demonstrates a proof-of-concept that such fluids can be used for analysis of qualitative differences of peptide patterns from larger patient cohorts, providing potential biomarkers for wound healing and infection.
PXD025928	34229011	Biochemical Insight into Novel Rab-GEF Activity of the Mammalian TRAPPIII Complex. 	Study of the TRAPP complexes by HDX-MS	TRAPPII TRAPPIII Rab HDX-MS	Transport Protein Particle complexes (TRAPP) are evolutionarily conserved regulators of membrane trafficking, with this mediated by their guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards Rab GTPases. In metazoans evidence suggests that two different TRAPP complexes exist, TRAPPII and TRAPPIII. These two complexes share a common core of subunits, with complex specific subunits (TRAPPC9 and TRAPPC10 in TRAPPII and TRAPPC8, TRAPPC11, TRAPPC12, TRAPPC13 in TRAPPIII). TRAPPII and TRAPPIII have distinct specificity for GEF activity towards Rabs, with TRAPPIII acting on Rab1, and TRAPPII acting on Rab1 and Rab11. The molecular basis for how these complex specific subunits alter GEF activity towards Rab GTPases is unknown. Here we have used a combination of biochemical assays, hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and electron microscopy to examine the regulation of TRAPPII and TRAPPIIII complexes in solution and on membranes. GEF assays revealed that TRAPPIII has GEF activity against Rab1 and Rab43, with no detectable activity against the other 18 Rabs tested. The TRAPPIII complex had significant differences in protein dynamics at the Rab binding site compared to TRAPPII, potentially indicating an important role of accessory subunits in altering the active site of TRAPP complexes. Both the TRAPPII and TRAPPIII complexes had enhanced GEF activity on lipid membranes, with HDX-MS revealing numerous conformational changes that accompany membrane association. HDX-MS also identified a membrane binding site in TRAPPC8. Collectively, our results provide insight into the functions of TRAPP complexes and how they can achieve Rab specificity.
PXD018363	34230103	Large-Scale Proteomic Assessment of Urinary Extracellular Vesicles Highlights Their Reliability in Reflecting Protein Changes in the Kidney. 	Proteome-scale correlation analysis between urinary extracellular vesicle (uEV) and kidney	correlation, kidney, urinary extracellular vesicle (uEV)	BACKGROUND: Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are secreted into urine by cells from the kidneys and urinary tract. Although changes in uEV proteins are used for quantitative assessment of protein levels in the kidney or biomarker discovery, whether they faithfully reflect (patho)physiologic changes in the kidney is a matter of debate. METHODS: Mass spectrometry was used to compare in an unbiased manner the correlations between protein levels in uEVs and kidney tissue from the same animal. Studies were performed on rats fed a normal or high K(+) diet. RESULTS: Absolute quantification determined a positive correlation (Pearson R=0.46 or 0.45, control or high K(+) respectively, P<0.0001) between the approximately 1000 proteins identified in uEVs and corresponding kidney tissue. Transmembrane proteins had greater positive correlations relative to cytoplasmic proteins. Proteins with high correlations (R>0.9), included exosome markers Tsg101 and Alix. Relative quantification highlighted a monotonic relationship between altered transporter/channel abundances in uEVs and the kidney after dietary K(+) manipulation. Analysis of genetic mouse models also revealed correlations between uEVs and kidney. CONCLUSION: This large-scale unbiased analysis identifies uEV proteins that track the abundance of the parent proteins in the kidney. The data form a novel resource for the kidney community and support the reliability of using uEV protein changes to monitor specific physiologic responses and disease mechanisms.
PXD026854	34230457	SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mouse olfactory system. 	SARS-CoV-2 infection causes transient olfactory dysfunction in mice	Anosmia, Immune response, Olfactory dysfunction, Olfactory receptor, Regeneration, SARS-CoV-2	SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans, and olfactory dysfunction is one of the most predictive and common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. However, the underlying mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to olfactory disorders remains elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 induces robust viral replication in the olfactory epithelium (OE), not the olfactory bulb (OB), resulting in transient olfactory dysfunction in humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mice. The sustentacular cells and Bowman's gland cells in the OE were identified as the major target cells of SARS-CoV-2 before invasion into olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers massive cell death and immune cell infiltration and directly impairs the uniformity of the OE structure. Combined transcriptomic and quantitative proteomic analyses revealed the induction of antiviral and inflammatory responses, as well as the downregulation of olfactory receptor (OR) genes in the OE from the infected animals. Overall, our mouse model recapitulates olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and provides critical clues for understanding the physiological basis for extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.
PXD025263	34231305	Unique protein interaction networks define the chromatin remodelling module of the NuRD complex. 	Unique Protein Interaction Networks Define The Chromatin Remodeling Module of The NuRD Complex	ChAHP complex, NCOR complex, NuRD complex, aggregation protein region, chromatin remodeling, protein-protein interactions	The combination of four proteins and their paralogues including MBD2/3, GATAD2A/B, CDK2AP1 and CHD3/4/5, which we refer to as the MGCC module, form the chromatin remodelling module of the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. To date, mechanisms by which the MGCC module acquires paralogue-specific function and specificity have not been addressed. Understanding the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the MGCC subunits is essential for defining underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Therefore, using pulldown followed by mass spectrometry analysis (PD-MS), we report a proteome-wide interaction network of the MGCC module in a paralogue-specific manner. Our data also demonstrate that the disordered C-terminal region of CHD3/4/5 is a gateway to incorporate remodelling activity into both ChAHP (CHD4, ADNP, HP1gamma) and NuRD complexes in a mutually exclusive manner. We define a short aggregation-prone region (APR) within the C-terminal segment of GATAD2B that is essential for the interaction of CHD4 and CDK2AP1 with the NuRD complex. Finally, we also report an association of CDK2AP1 with the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCOR) complex. Overall, this study provides insight into the possible mechanisms through which the MGCC module can achieve specificity and diverse biological functions.
PXD025088	34232632	Evolution of Polymyxin Resistance Regulates Colibactin Production in Escherichia coli. 	Polymyxin resistance in colibactin-producing Escherichia coli induces host genotoxicity	Colibactin, Escherichia coli, antimicrobial resistance	The complex reservoir of metabolite-producing bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract contributes tremendously to human health and disease. Bacterial composition, and by extension gut metabolomic composition, is undoubtably influenced by the use of modern antibiotics. Herein, we demonstrate that polymyxin B, a last resort antibiotic, influences the production of the genotoxic metabolite colibactin from adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) NC101. Colibactin can promote colorectal cancer through DNA double stranded breaks and interstrand cross-links. While the structure and biosynthesis of colibactin have been elucidated, chemical-induced regulation of its biosynthetic gene cluster and subsequent production of the genotoxin by E. coli are largely unexplored. Using a multiomic approach, we identified that polymyxin B stress enhances the abundance of colibactin biosynthesis proteins (Clb's) in multiple pks+ E. coli strains, including pro-carcinogenic AIEC, NC101; the probiotic strain, Nissle 1917; and the antibiotic testing strain, ATCC 25922. Expression analysis via qPCR revealed that increased transcription of clb genes likely contributes to elevated Clb protein levels in NC101. Enhanced production of Clb's by NC101 under polymyxin stress matched an increased production of the colibactin prodrug motif, a proxy for the mature genotoxic metabolite. Furthermore, E. coli with a heightened tolerance for polymyxin induced greater mammalian DNA damage, assessed by quantification of gammaH2AX staining in cultured intestinal epithelial cells. This study establishes a key link between the polymyxin B stress response and colibactin production in pks+ E. coli. Ultimately, our findings will inform future studies investigating colibactin regulation and the ability of seemingly innocuous commensal microbes to induce host disease.
PXD015834	34233002	The phase separation-dependent FUS interactome reveals nuclear and cytoplasmic function of liquid-liquid phase separation. 	The phase separation-dependent FUS interactome reveals nuclear and cytoplasmic function of liquid-liquid phase separation	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Fused in Sarcoma, Liquid-liquid phase separation	Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and RNAs has emerged as the driving force underlying the formation of membrane-less organelles. Such biomolecular condensates have various biological functions and have been linked to disease. The protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS and mutations in FUS have been causally linked to the motor neuron disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS-FUS). LLPS followed by aggregation of cytoplasmic FUS has been proposed to be a crucial disease mechanism. However, it is currently unclear how LLPS impacts the behaviour of FUS in cells, e.g. its interactome. Hence, we developed a method allowing for the purification of LLPS FUS-containing droplets from cell lysates. We observe substantial alterations in the interactome, depending on its biophysical state. While non-LLPS FUS interacts mainly with factors involved in pre-mRNA processing, LLPS FUS predominantly binds to proteins involved in chromatin remodelling and DNA damage repair. Interestingly, also mitochondrial factors are strongly enriched with LLPS FUS, providing a potential explanation for the observed changes in mitochondrial gene expression in mouse models of ALS-FUS. In summary, we present a methodology to investigate the interactomes of phase separating proteins and provide evidence that LLPS shapes the FUS interactome with implications for function and disease.
PXD016052	34233189	NELL2-cdc42 signaling regulates BAF complexes and Ewing sarcoma cell growth. 	Human A673 Ewing sarcoma secretome - effect of EWS-FLI-1 silencing	EWS-FLI-1, Ewing sarcoma, GeLC-MS/MS, secretome	BAF chromatin remodeling complexes play important roles in chromatin regulation and cancer. Here, we report that Ewing sarcoma cells are dependent on the autocrine signaling mediated by NELL2, a secreted glycoprotein that has been characterized as an axon guidance molecule. NELL2 uses Robo3 as the receptor to transmit critical growth signaling. NELL2 signaling inhibits cdc42 and upregulates BAF complexes and EWS-FLI1 transcriptional output. We demonstrate that cdc42 is a negative regulator of BAF complexes, inducing actin polymerization and complex disassembly. Furthermore, we identify NELL2(high)CD133(high)EWS-FLI1(high) and NELL2(low)CD133(low)EWS-FLI1(low) populations in Ewing sarcoma, which display phenotypes consistent with high and low NELL2 signaling, respectively. We show that NELL2, CD133, and EWS-FLI1 positively regulate each other and upregulate BAF complexes and cell proliferation in Ewing sarcoma. These results reveal a signaling pathway regulating critical chromatin remodeling complexes and cancer cell proliferation.
PXD026493	34234130	M1BP cooperates with CP190 to activate transcription at TAD borders and promote chromatin insulator activity. 	M1BP cooperates with CP190 to activate transcription at TAD borders and promote chromatin insulator activity	CP190, Drosophila, embryonic nuclear extract	Genome organization is driven by forces affecting transcriptional state, but the relationship between transcription and genome architecture remains unclear. Here, we identified the Drosophila transcription factor Motif 1 Binding Protein (M1BP) in physical association with the gypsy chromatin insulator core complex, including the universal insulator protein CP190. M1BP is required for enhancer-blocking and barrier activities of the gypsy insulator as well as its proper nuclear localization. Genome-wide, M1BP specifically colocalizes with CP190 at Motif 1-containing promoters, which are enriched at topologically associating domain (TAD) borders. M1BP facilitates CP190 chromatin binding at many shared sites and vice versa. Both factors promote Motif 1-dependent gene expression and transcription near TAD borders genome-wide. Finally, loss of M1BP reduces chromatin accessibility and increases both inter- and intra-TAD local genome compaction. Our results reveal physical and functional interaction between CP190 and M1BP to activate transcription at TAD borders and mediate chromatin insulator-dependent genome organization.
PXD024794	34234345	BANP opens chromatin and activates CpG-island-regulated genes. 	BANP is an essential transcription factor that opens chromatin and activates CpG island regulated genes	BANP, CGI promoters, CpG island, PAQMAN, TF binding, single-molecule footprinting	The majority of gene transcripts generated by RNA polymerase II in mammalian genomes initiate at CpG island (CGI) promoters(1,2), yet our understanding of their regulation remains limited. This is in part due to the incomplete information that we have on transcription factors, their DNA-binding motifs and which genomic binding sites are functional in any given cell type(3-5). In addition, there are orphan motifs without known binders, such as the CGCG element, which is associated with highly expressed genes across human tissues and enriched near the transcription start site of a subset of CGI promoters(6-8). Here we combine single-molecule footprinting with interaction proteomics to identify BTG3-associated nuclear protein (BANP) as the transcription factor that binds this element in the mouse and human genome. We show that BANP is a strong CGI activator that controls essential metabolic genes in pluripotent stem and terminally differentiated neuronal cells. BANP binding is repelled by DNA methylation of its motif in vitro and in vivo, which epigenetically restricts most binding to CGIs and accounts for differential binding at aberrantly methylated CGI promoters in cancer cells. Upon binding to an unmethylated motif, BANP opens chromatin and phases nucleosomes. These findings establish BANP as a critical activator of a set of essential genes and suggest a model in which the activity of CGI promoters relies on methylation-sensitive transcription factors that are capable of chromatin opening.
PXD015872	34234780	Comparative Proteomic Analysis Reveals Varying Impact on Immune Responses in Phorbol 12-Myristate-13-Acetate-Mediated THP-1 Monocyte-to-Macrophage Differentiation. 	Dose-dependent phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate mediated monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation induces unique proteomic signatures in THP1 cells	Innate immune signaling, Macrophage differentiation, cytokines and chemokines, functional networks	Macrophages are sentinels of the innate immune system, and the human monocytic cell line THP-1 is one of the widely used in vitro models to study inflammatory processes and immune responses. Several monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation protocols exist, with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) being the most commonly used and accepted method. However, the concentrations and duration of PMA treatment vary widely in the published literature and could affect the probed phenotype, however their effect on protein expression is not fully deciphered. In this study, we employed a dimethyl labeling-based quantitative proteomics approach to determine the changes in the protein repertoire of macrophage-like cells differentiated from THP-1 monocytes by three commonly used PMA-based differentiation protocols. Employing an integrated network analysis, we show that variations in PMA concentration and duration of rest post-stimulation result in downstream differences in the protein expression and cellular signaling processes. We demonstrate that these differences result in altered inflammatory responses, including variation in the expression of cytokines upon stimulation with various Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. Together, these findings provide a valuable resource that significantly expands the knowledge of protein expression dynamics with one of the most common in vitro models for macrophages, which in turn has a profound impact on the immune as well as inflammatory responses being studied.
PXD025930	34236315	Loss of MGA repression mediated by an atypical polycomb complex promotes tumor progression and invasiveness. 	MGA interactome in 293T cells using affinity purification and mass spectrometry	MGA, immunoprecipitation, interactome	MGA, a transcription factor and member of the MYC network, is mutated or deleted in a broad spectrum of malignancies. As a critical test of a tumor suppressive role, we inactivated Mga in two mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer using a CRISPR-based approach. MGA loss significantly accelerated tumor growth in both models and led to de-repression of non-canonical Polycomb ncPRC1.6 targets, including genes involved in metastasis and meiosis. Moreover, MGA deletion in human lung adenocarcinoma lines augmented invasive capabilities. We further show that MGA-MAX, E2F6, and L3MBTL2 co-occupy thousands of promoters and that MGA stabilizes these ncPRC1.6 subunits. Lastly, we report that MGA loss also induces a pro-growth effect in human colon organoids. Our studies establish MGA as a bona fide tumor suppressor in vivo and suggest a tumor suppressive mechanism in adenocarcinomas resulting from widespread transcriptional attenuation of MYC and E2F target genes mediated by MGA-MAX associated with a non-canonical Polycomb complex.
PXD022778	34236864	Accurately Assigning Peptides to Spectra When Only a Subset of Peptides Are Relevant. 	Accurately Assigning Peptides to Spectra When Only a Subset of Peptides Are Relevant	UPS1, castor, ricin	The standard proteomics database search strategy involves searching spectra against a peptide database and estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) of the resulting set of peptide-spectrum matches. One assumption of this protocol is that all the peptides in the database are relevant to the hypothesis being investigated. However, in settings where researchers are interested in a subset of peptides, alternative search and FDR control strategies are needed. Recently, two methods were proposed to address this problem: subset-search and all-sub. We show that both methods fail to control the FDR. For subset-search, this failure is due to the presence of "neighbor" peptides, which are defined as irrelevant peptides with a similar precursor mass and fragmentation spectrum as a relevant peptide. Not considering neighbors compromises the FDR estimate because a spectrum generated by an irrelevant peptide can incorrectly match well to a relevant peptide. Therefore, we have developed a new method, "subset-neighbor search" (SNS), that accounts for neighbor peptides. We show evidence that SNS controls the FDR when neighbors are present and that SNS outperforms group-FDR, the only other method that appears to control the FDR relative to a subset of relevant peptides.
PXD025691	34237252	Liver-fibrosis-activated transcriptional networks govern hepatocyte reprogramming and intra-hepatic communication. 	Fibrosis-activated transcriptional networks govern hepatocyte reprogramming and intra-hepatic communication in metabolic associated liver fibrosis	Elf3, Exploris 480, Glis2, Liver fibrosis, NASH, PRM	Liver fibrosis is a strong predictor of long-term mortality in individuals with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease; yet, the mechanisms underlying the progression from the comparatively benign fatty liver state to advanced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis are incompletely understood. Using cell-type-resolved genomics, we show that comprehensive alterations in hepatocyte genomic and transcriptional settings during NASH progression, led to a loss of hepatocyte identity. The hepatocyte reprogramming was under tight cooperative control of a network of fibrosis-activated transcription factors, as exemplified by the transcription factor Elf-3 (ELF3) and zinc finger protein GLIS2 (GLIS2). Indeed, ELF3- and GLIS2-controlled fibrosis-dependent hepatokine genes targeting disease-associated hepatic stellate cell gene programs. Thus, interconnected transcription factor networks not only promoted hepatocyte dysfunction but also directed the intra-hepatic crosstalk necessary for NASH and fibrosis progression, implying that molecular "hub-centered" targeting strategies are superior to existing mono-target approaches as currently used in NASH therapy.
PXD023716	34237460	Integrated tissue proteome and metabolome reveal key elements and regulatory pathways in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. 	Integrated tissue proteome and metabolome reveal key elements and regulatory pathways in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma	CSCC, metabolomics	Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a widespread malignancy but has a very low long-term survival rate for patients at the metastatic stage. Therefore, it is urgent to identify prognostic biomarkers for CSCC and improve our understanding of disease progression. Here we took advantage of a data-independent acquisition (DIA)-based nano liquid chromatography equipped with an orbitrap mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) and ultraperformance LC coupled to a time-of-flight tandem MS (UPLC-TOF-MS/MS) technique to analyze cancer and corresponding noncancerous tissues from 20 CSCC patients for integrated proteomic and metabolomic analyses. Overall, 6241 tissue proteins were detected, while 136 proteins were significantly expressed in CSCC tissues. Further functional analysis revealed that various biological processes were highly enriched and participated in the pathogenesis of CSCC, especially DNA damage responses. Moreover, 641 named metabolites in total were identified, among which 181 were significantly changed in CSCC tissues. A total of 101 pathways were significantly enriched including apoptosis, autophagy, PI3K-Akt and mTOR signaling pathways. Interestingly, two pathways, protein digestion & absorption and platelet activation were both enriched in proteomic and metabolomic studies involving 5 proteins and 11 metabolites. Accordingly, a four-metabolite panel consisting of arachidonate, glutamine, glutamic acid, and proline (all area under the curve (AUC) values more than 0.9) was developed with a high accuracy (0.971) to distinguish the 20 detected cancer tissues from their noncancerous tissues. Collectively, our work highlighted the key elements and regulatory pathways involved in the pathogenesis of CSCC. More importantly, the present study not only provided potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of CSCC, but also expanded our knowledge of the physiopathology of the disease. SIGNIFICANCE: CSCC is the second most common human cancer but has few treatment options and few sensitive biomarkers for diagnosis. Here we comprehensively revealed its molecular characteristics by performing integrated tissue proteomic and metabolomic analyses. Significantly distinct profiles and certain enriched pathways including DNA damage responses were identified as associated with CSCC. Moreover, protein digestion & absorption and platelet activation were both enriched in the proteome and metabolome. These identified molecular changes probably play significant roles in CSCC development. Finally, we developed a four-metabolite panel to distinguish CSCC with high accuracy. Overall, our data not only provided potential diagnostic biomarkers, but also extended knowledge on the pathogenesis of CSCC.
PXD022680	34237461	Phosphorylation of Ser1452 on BRG1 inhibits the function of the SWI/SNF complex in chromatin activation. 	MS analysis of phosphopeptides enriched from BRG1-phospho mutants	BRG1, SWI/SNF, phosphoprotein	BRG1, one of core subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is frequently mutated in cancers. Previously, we reported significant downregulation of the phosphorylation level of BRG1 on Ser(1452) (<10%) in cell lines derived from ovarian clear cell carcinoma with frequent recurrence and acquired drug resistance. In this study, we tried to elucidate the roles of BRG1 phosphorylation, using cell lines expressing wild-type, phosphorylation-mimic (brg1-S(1452)D), or non-phosphorylatable (brg1-S(1452)A) BRG1. Quantitative proteomic analyses revealed upregulation of proteins and phosphoproteins related to linker histone H1s, histone methylation, and protein ubiquitylation in brg1-S(1452)D cells, which may coordinately promote the chromatin inactivation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of target proteins. Consistent with these results, brg1-S(1452)D cells exhibited an increase in condensed chromatin and polyubiquitylated proteins. In brg1-S(1452)D cells, we also detected downregulation of various cancer-related proteins (e.g., EGFR and MET) as well as decreased migration, proliferation, and sensitivity to taxanes and oxaliplatin. Together, our results reveal that BRG1 phosphorylation drives tumor malignancy by inhibiting the functions of SWI/SNF complex in chromatin activation, thereby promoting expression of various cancer-related proteins. SIGNIFICANCE: For the first time we demonstrated that the mutation on Ser(1452) phosphorylation site of BRG1, a component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, changed protein and phosphoprotein levels of linker histone H1s, binding competitor of histone H1s, and histone methylase/demethylase involved in the heterochromatic histone modifications to promote the chromatin inactivation. In phosphorylation-mimic mutant, significant decrease of various cancer-related proteins as well as migration, proliferation, and sensitivity to specific antitumor agents were detected. Our results reveal that BRG1 phosphorylation drives tumor malignancy by inhibiting the functions of SWI/SNF complex in chromatin activation, thereby promoting expression of various cancer-related proteins.
PXD024806	34238254	Inference of kinase-signaling networks in human myeloid cell line models by Phosphoproteomics using kinase activity enrichment analysis (KAEA). 	Inference of Kinase-Signaling Networks in Human Myeloid Cell Line Models by Phosphoproteomics using Kinase Activity Enrichment Analysis (KAEA)	kinase activity, kinase-signaling network, myeloid malignancies, phosphoproteomics	BACKGROUND: Despite the introduction of targeted therapies, most patients with myeloid malignancies will not be cured and progress. Genomics is useful to elucidate the mutational landscape but remains limited in the prediction of therapeutic outcome and identification of targets for resistance. Dysregulation of phosphorylation-based signaling pathways is a hallmark of cancer, and therefore, kinase-inhibitors are playing an increasingly important role as targeted treatments. Untargeted phosphoproteomics analysis pipelines have been published but show limitations in inferring kinase-activities and identifying potential biomarkers of response and resistance. METHODS: We developed a phosphoproteomics workflow based on titanium dioxide phosphopeptide enrichment with subsequent analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We applied a novel Kinase-Activity Enrichment Analysis (KAEA) pipeline on differential phosphoproteomics profiles, which is based on the recently published SetRank enrichment algorithm  with reduced false positive rates. Kinase activities were inferred by this algorithm using an extensive reference database comprising five experimentally validated kinase-substrate meta-databases complemented with the NetworKIN in-silico prediction tool. For the proof of concept, we used human myeloid cell lines (K562, NB4, THP1, OCI-AML3, MOLM13 and MV4-11) with known oncogenic drivers and exposed them to clinically established kinase-inhibitors. RESULTS: Biologically meaningful over- and under-active kinases were identified by KAEA in the unperturbed human myeloid cell lines (K562, NB4, THP1, OCI-AML3 and MOLM13). To increase the inhibition signal of the driving oncogenic kinases, we exposed the K562 (BCR-ABL1) and MOLM13/MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD) cell lines to either Nilotinib or Midostaurin kinase inhibitors, respectively. We observed correct detection of expected direct (ABL, KIT, SRC) and indirect (MAPK) targets of Nilotinib in K562 as well as indirect (PRKC, MAPK, AKT, RPS6K) targets of Midostaurin in MOLM13/MV4-11, respectively. Moreover, our pipeline was able to characterize unexplored kinase-activities within the corresponding signaling networks. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a novel KAEA pipeline for the analysis of differential phosphoproteomics MS profiling data. We provide translational researchers with an improved instrument to characterize the biological behavior of kinases in response or resistance to targeted treatment. Further investigations are warranted to determine the utility of KAEA to characterize mechanisms of disease progression and treatment failure using primary patient samples.
PXD022582	34239088	MaxDIA enables library-based and library-free data-independent acquisition proteomics. 	MaxDIA enables highly sensitive and accurate library-based and library-free data-independent acquisition proteomics (DDA data)	Benchmark, MaxQuant	MaxDIA is a software platform for analyzing data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics data within the MaxQuant software environment. Using spectral libraries, MaxDIA achieves deep proteome coverage with substantially better coefficients of variation in protein quantification than other software. MaxDIA is equipped with accurate false discovery rate (FDR) estimates on both library-to-DIA match and protein levels, including when using whole-proteome predicted spectral libraries. This is the foundation of discovery DIA-hypothesis-free analysis of DIA samples without library and with reliable FDR control. MaxDIA performs three- or four-dimensional feature detection of fragment data, and scoring of matches is augmented by machine learning on the features of an identification. MaxDIA's bootstrap DIA workflow performs multiple rounds of matching with increasing quality of recalibration and stringency of matching to the library. Combining MaxDIA with two new technologies-BoxCar acquisition and trapped ion mobility spectrometry-both lead to deep and accurate proteome quantification.
PXD024425	34239127	K29-linked ubiquitin signaling regulates proteotoxic stress response and cell cycle. 	putative K29-linked substrates identification using sAB-K29	K29-linked ubiquitination	Protein ubiquitination shows remarkable topological and functional diversity through the polymerization of ubiquitin via different linkages. Deciphering the cellular ubiquitin code is of central importance to understand the physiology of the cell. However, our understanding of its function is rather limited due to the lack of specific binders as tools to detect K29-linked polyubiquitin. In this study, we screened and characterized a synthetic antigen-binding fragment, termed sAB-K29, that can specifically recognize K29-linked polyubiquitin using chemically synthesized K29-linked diubiquitin. We further determined the crystal structure of this fragment bound to the K29-linked diubiquitin, which revealed the molecular basis of specificity. Using sAB-K29 as a tool, we uncovered that K29-linked ubiquitination is involved in different kinds of cellular proteotoxic stress response as well as cell cycle regulation. In particular, we showed that K29-linked ubiquitination is enriched in the midbody and downregulation of the K29-linked ubiquitination signal arrests cells in G1/S phase.
PXD011971	34240547	Triple extraction method enables high quality mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phospho-proteomics for eventual multi-omics integration studies. 	Comparison of proteomic and phospho-proteomic analysis upon urea extraction and triple extraction	SAX, TiO2, bladder cancer, triple extraction, urea	Large-scale multi-omic analysis allows a thorough understanding of different physiological or pathological conditions, particularly cancer. Here, an extraction method simultaneously yielding DNA, RNA and protein (thereby referred to as "triple extraction", TEx) was tested for its suitability to unbiased, system-wide proteomic investigation. Largely proven efficient for transcriptomic and genomic studies, we aimed at exploring TEx compatibility with mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phospho-proteomics, as compared to a standard urea extraction. TEx is suitable for the shotgun investigation of proteomes, providing similar results as urea-based protocol both at the qualitative and quantitative levels. TEx is likewise compatible with the exploration of phosphorylation events, actually providing a higher number of correctly localized sites than urea, although the nature of extracted modifications appears somewhat distinct between both techniques. These results highlight that the presented protocol is well suited for the examination of the proteome and modified proteome of this bladder cancer cell model, as efficiently as other more widely used workflows for mass spectrometry-based analysis. Potentially applicable to other mammalian cell types and tissues, TEx represents an advantageous strategy for multi-omics on scarce and/or heterogenous samples.
PXD024458	34240805	Evaluation of an E. coli Cell Extract Prepared by Lysozyme-Assisted Sonication via Gene Expression, Phage Assembly and Proteomics. 	Preparation of a high expression yield bacterial cell extract via lysozyme-assisted sonication	Cell-free protein expression, bacterial cell extract, in vitro transcription-translation, phage assembly, synthetic biology	Over the past decades, starting from crude cell extracts, a variety of successful preparation protocols and optimized reaction conditions have been established for the production of cell-free gene expression systems. One of the crucial steps during the preparation of cell extract-based expression systems is the cell lysis procedure itself, which largely determines the quality of the active components of the extract. Here we evaluate the utility of an E. coli cell extract, which was prepared using a combination of lysozyme incubation and a gentle sonication step. As quality measure, we demonstrate the cell-free expression of YFP at concentrations up to 0.6 mg/mL. In addition, we produced and assembled T7 bacteriophages up to a titer of 10(8)  PFU/mL. State-of-the-art quantitative proteomics was used to compare the produced extracts with each other and with a commercial extract. The differences in protein composition were surprisingly small between lysozyme-assisted sonication (LAS) extracts, but we observed an increase in the release of DNA-binding proteins for increasing numbers of sonication cycles. Proteins taking part in carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, amino acid and nucleotide related pathways were found to be more abundant in the LAS extract, while proteins related to RNA modification and processing, DNA modification and replication, transcription regulation, initiation, termination and the TCA cycle were found enriched in the commercial extract.
PXD022784	34242034	Mass Spectrometry Provides a Highly Sensitive Noninvasive Means of Sequencing and Tracking M-Protein in the Blood of Multiple Myeloma Patients. 	Mass spectrometry provides a highly sensitive non-invasive means of sequencing and tracking M-protein levels in blood of multiple myeloma patients	m-protein, multiple myeloma	The amino acid sequence of the M-protein for multiple myeloma is unique compared to the polyclonal antibodies in patients' blood. This uniqueness is exploited to develop an ultrasensitive M-protein detection method utilizing mass spectrometry (MS). The method involves the de novo amino acid sequencing of the full-length M-protein, and a targeted MS/MS assay to detect and quantify the unique M-protein sequence in serum samples. Healthy control serum spiked with NISTmAb and serial samples from an MM patient were used to demonstrate the ability of the platform to sequence and monitor a target M-protein. The de novo NISTmAb protein sequence obtained matched the published sequence, confirming the ability of the platform to accurately sequence a target M-protein in serum. NISTmAb was quantified down to 0.0002 g/dL in serum, a level hundreds of times more sensitive than conventional blood-based tests such as SPEP and IFE. The M-protein in the patient sample could be quantified throughout complete remission, demonstrating the utility of the assay to track M-protein considerably beyond the sensitivities of current blood-based tests. Notably, the assay detected a 2-fold rise in M-protein levels 10 months before any changes were detected by conventional IFE. The MS-based assay is highly sensitive, noninvasive, and requires only a small amount of serum, less than 100 muL. Sequencing data is deposited into PRIDE with identifier PXD022784, and quantification data can be found in Panorama Public with identifier PXD022980.
PXD025239	34244494	Extracellular matrix protein-1 secretory isoform promotes ovarian cancer through increasing alternative mRNA splicing and stemness. 	Human, ovarian epithelial cancer cell line, LC-MSMS	Antibodies (B/D-HPP), Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), ECM1 subtypes, ECM1a, ECM1a wild type (WT), ECM1b, Human Proteome Project, Ovarian epithelial cell line, ProteomeXchange project tag: Cancer (B/D-HPP)	Extracellular matrix protein-1 (ECM1) promotes tumorigenesis in multiple organs but the mechanisms associated to ECM1 isoform subtypes have yet to be clarified. We report in this study that the secretory ECM1a isoform induces tumorigenesis through the GPR motif binding to integrin alphaXbeta2 and the activation of AKT/FAK/Rho/cytoskeleton signaling. The ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1) transduces the ECM1a-integrin alphaXbeta2 interactive signaling to facilitate the phosphorylation of AKT/FAK/Rho/cytoskeletal molecules and to confer cancer cell cisplatin resistance through up-regulation of the CD326-mediated cell stemness. On the contrary, the non-secretory ECM1b isoform binds myosin and blocks its phosphorylation, impairing cytoskeleton-mediated signaling and tumorigenesis. Moreover, ECM1a induces the expression of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L like (hnRNPLL) protein to favor the alternative mRNA splicing generating ECM1a. ECM1a, alphaXbeta2, ABCG1 and hnRNPLL higher expression associates with poor survival, while ECM1b higher expression associates with good survival. These results highlight ECM1a, integrin alphaXbeta2, hnRNPLL and ABCG1 as potential targets for treating cancers associated with ECM1-activated signaling.
PXD021227	34244496	Arginine methylation promotes siRNA-binding specificity for a spermatogenesis-specific isoform of the Argonaute protein CSR-1. 	CSR-1A post-translational modification	C. elegans, CSR-1A, dimethylation	CSR-1 is an essential Argonaute protein that binds to a subclass of 22G-RNAs targeting most germline-expressed genes. Here we show that the two isoforms of CSR-1 have distinct expression patterns; CSR-1B is ubiquitously expressed throughout the germline and during all stages of development while CSR-1A expression is restricted to germ cells undergoing spermatogenesis. Furthermore, CSR-1A associates preferentially with 22G-RNAs mapping to spermatogenesis-specific genes whereas CSR-1B-bound small RNAs map predominantly to oogenesis-specific genes. Interestingly, the exon unique to CSR-1A contains multiple dimethylarginine modifications, which are necessary for the preferential binding of CSR-1A to spermatogenesis-specific 22G-RNAs. Thus, we have discovered a regulatory mechanism for C. elegans Argonaute proteins that allows for specificity of small RNA binding between similar Argonaute proteins with overlapping temporal and spatial localization.
PXD022500	34244565	Reciprocal interaction between SIRT6 and APC/C regulates genomic stability. 	293T cell mitotic AP-MS anti-SIRT6-FLAG 201113	293T, AP-MS, mitosis	SIRT6 is an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase that plays an important role in mitosis fidelity and genome stability. In the present study, we found that SIRT6 overexpression leads to mitosis defects and aneuploidy. We identified SIRT6 as a novel substrate of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is a master regulator of mitosis. Both CDH1 and CDC20, co-activators of APC/C, mediated SIRT6 degradation via the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Reciprocally, SIRT6 also deacetylated CDH1 at lysine K135 and promoted its degradation, resulting in an increase in APC/C-CDH1-targeted substrates, dysfunction in centrosome amplification, and chromosome instability. Our findings demonstrate the importance of SIRT6 for genome integrity during mitotic progression and reveal how SIRT6 and APC/C cooperate to drive mitosis.
PXD012992	34244767	LDIP cooperates with SEIPIN and LDAP to facilitate lipid droplet biogenesis in Arabidopsis. 	Proteomic characterization of LDIP mutant phenotypes in  Arabidopsis seedlings	LDAP-interacting protein, LDIP, Lipid droplets	Cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) are evolutionarily conserved organelles that store neutral lipids and play critical roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their biogenesis at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain obscure. Here we show that a recently identified protein termed LD-associated protein [LDAP]-interacting protein (LDIP) works together with both endoplasmic reticulum-localized SEIPIN and the LD-coat protein LDAP to facilitate LD formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Heterologous expression in insect cells demonstrated that LDAP is required for the targeting of LDIP to the LD surface, and both proteins are required for the production of normal numbers and sizes of LDs in plant cells. LDIP also interacts with SEIPIN via a conserved hydrophobic helix in SEIPIN and LDIP functions together with SEIPIN to modulate LD numbers and sizes in plants. Further, the co-expression of both proteins is required to restore normal LD production in SEIPIN-deficient yeast cells. These data, combined with the analogous function of LDIP to a mammalian protein called LD Assembly Factor 1, are discussed in the context of a new model for LD biogenesis in plant cells with evolutionary connections to LD biogenesis in other eukaryotes.
PXD024695	34244791	The conserved Tpk1 regulates non-homologous end joining double-strand break repair by phosphorylation of Nej1, a homolog of the human XLF. 	The Conserved Tpk1 Regulates Non-Homologous End Joining Double-Strand Break Repair by Phosphorylation of Nej1, a Homolog of the Human XLF	DSB repair, Genomic instability, Kinase, NEJ1, NHEJ, PRKACB, TPK1	The yeast cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is a ubiquitous serine-threonine kinase, encompassing three catalytic (Tpk1-3) and one regulatory (Bcy1) subunits. Evidence suggests PKA involvement in DNA damage checkpoint response, but how DNA repair pathways are regulated by PKA subunits remains inconclusive. Here, we report that deleting the tpk1 catalytic subunit reduces non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) efficiency, whereas tpk2-3 and bcy1 deletion does not. Epistatic analyses revealed that tpk1, as well as the DNA damage checkpoint kinase (dun1) and NHEJ factor (nej1), co-function in the same pathway, and parallel to the NHEJ factor yku80. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and resection data suggest that tpk1 deletion influences repair protein recruitments and DNA resection. Further, we show that Tpk1 phosphorylation of Nej1 at S298 (a Dun1 phosphosite) is indispensable for NHEJ repair and nuclear targeting of Nej1 and its binding partner Lif1. In mammalian cells, loss of PRKACB (human homolog of Tpk1) also reduced NHEJ efficiency, and similarly, PRKACB was found to phosphorylate XLF (a Nej1 human homolog) at S263, a corresponding residue of the yeast Nej1 S298. Together, our results uncover a new and conserved mechanism for Tpk1 and PRKACB in phosphorylating Nej1 (or XLF), which is critically required for NHEJ repair.
PXD020331	34245671	An mTORC1-GRASP55 signaling axis controls unconventional secretion to reshape the extracellular proteome upon stress. 	mTORC1 regulates GRASP55-dependent unconventional secretion in response to stress	GRASP55, Golgi, Rapamycin, TSC2, cellular stress response, mTORC1, unconventional secretion	Cells communicate with their environment via surface proteins and secreted factors. Unconventional protein secretion (UPS) is an evolutionarily conserved process, via which distinct cargo proteins are secreted upon stress. Most UPS types depend upon the Golgi-associated GRASP55 protein. However, its regulation and biological role remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) directly phosphorylates GRASP55 to maintain its Golgi localization, thus revealing a physiological role for mTORC1 at this organelle. Stimuli that inhibit mTORC1 cause GRASP55 dephosphorylation and relocalization to UPS compartments. Through multiple, unbiased, proteomic analyses, we identify numerous cargoes that follow this unconventional secretory route to reshape the cellular secretome and surfactome. Using MMP2 secretion as a proxy for UPS, we provide important insights on its regulation and physiological role. Collectively, our findings reveal the mTORC1-GRASP55 signaling hub as the integration point in stress signaling upstream of UPS and as a key coordinator of the cellular adaptation to stress.
PXD023445	34248881	Surfaceome and Exoproteome Dynamics in Dual-Species Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus Biofilms. 	Surfaceome and exoproteome analysis of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa mono- and co-culture biofilms	MaxQuant, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, biofilm, co-culture, exoproteome, surfaceome	Bacterial biofilms are an important underlying cause for chronic infections. By switching into the biofilm state, bacteria can evade host defenses and withstand antibiotic chemotherapy. Despite the fact that biofilms at clinical and environmental settings are mostly composed of multiple microbial species, biofilm research has largely been focused on single-species biofilms. In this study, we investigated the interaction between two clinically relevant bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by label-free quantitative proteomics focusing on proteins associated with the bacterial cell surfaces (surfaceome) and proteins exported/released to the extracellular space (exoproteome). The changes observed in the surfaceome and exoproteome of P. aeruginosa pointed toward higher motility and lower pigment production when co-cultured with S. aureus. In S. aureus, lower abundances of proteins related to cell wall biosynthesis and cell division, suggesting increased persistence, were observed in the dual-species biofilm. Complementary phenotypic analyses confirmed the higher motility and the lower pigment production in P. aeruginosa when co-cultured with S. aureus. Higher antimicrobial tolerance associated with the co-culture setting was additionally observed in both species. To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first systematic explorations providing insights into the dynamics of both the surfaceome and exoproteome of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa dual-species biofilms.
PXD012048	34249966	Urethral Catheter Biofilms Reveal Plasticity in Bacterial Composition and Metabolism and Withstand Host Immune Defenses in Hypoxic Environment. 	Longitudinal Surveys Show that Urethral Catheters Harbor Recurrent Polymicrobial Biofilms with Cooperative and Competitive Behaviors Among Cohabitating Pathogens	Longitudinal, Metaproteomics, Urethral Catheters, biofilm, urinary tract infection	Biofilms composed of multiple microorganisms colonize the surfaces of indwelling urethral catheters that are used serially by neurogenic bladder patients and cause chronic infections. Well-adapted pathogens in this niche are Escherichia coli, Proteus, and Enterococcus spp., species that cycle through adhesion and multilayered cell growth, trigger host immune responses, are starved off nutrients, and then disperse. Viable microbial foci retained in the urinary tract recolonize catheter surfaces. The molecular adaptations of bacteria in catheter biofilms (CBs) are not well-understood, promising new insights into this pathology based on host and microbial meta-omics analyses from clinical specimens. We examined catheters from nine neurogenic bladder patients longitudinally over up to 6 months. Taxonomic analyses from 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics revealed that 95% of all catheter and corresponding urinary pellet (UP) samples contained bacteria. CB biomasses were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae spp. and often accompanied by lactic acid and anaerobic bacteria. Systemic antibiotic drug treatments of patients resulted in either transient or lasting microbial community perturbations. Neutrophil effector proteins were abundant not only in UP but also CB samples, indicating their penetration of biofilm surfaces. In the context of one patient who advanced to a kidney infection, Proteus mirabilis proteomic data suggested a combination of factors associated with this disease complication: CB biomasses were high; the bacteria produced urease alkalinizing the pH and triggering urinary salt deposition on luminal catheter surfaces; P. mirabilis utilized energy-producing respiratory systems more than in CBs from other patients. The NADH:quinone oxidoreductase II (Nqr), a Na(+) translocating enzyme not operating as a proton pump, and the nitrate reductase A (Nar) equipped the pathogen with electron transport chains promoting growth under hypoxic conditions. Both P. mirabilis and E. coli featured repertoires of transition metal ion acquisition systems in response to human host-mediated iron and zinc sequestration. We discovered a new drug target, the Nqr respiratory system, whose deactivation may compromise P. mirabilis growth in a basic pH milieu. Animal models would not allow such molecular-level insights into polymicrobial biofilm metabolism and interactions because the complexity cannot be replicated.
PXD016481	34250561	Identification of bone morphogenetic protein 4 in the saliva after the placement of fixed orthodontic appliance. 	Bone morphogenetic protein 4 in human saliva during orthodontic therapy	BMP4, BMPER, bone remodeling, orthodontic tooth movement, saliva	BACKGROUND: This study was conducted in order to explore the effects of orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) on the changes of salivary proteome. This prospective observational pilot study recruited 12 healthy teenage boys with malocclusion treated with a fixed orthodontic appliance and 6 appropriate control participants. Saliva samples were collected a day before and at 0, 2, 7, and 30 days after initialization of treatment, corresponding to the initial, lag, and post-lag phases of OTM. Pooled samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, ELISA, and Western blotting. To date, there is no published data on the presence of BMP molecules or their antagonists in the saliva or in the gingival cervical fluid related to orthodontic conditions. RESULTS: A total of 198 identified saliva proteins were classified based on their functional characteristics. Proteins involved in bone remodeling were observed exclusively 30 days post appliance placement, including bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), a BMP antagonist BMP-binding endothelial regulator, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, cytoskeleton-associated protein 4, and fibroblast growth factor 5. Based on the analysis of protein interactions, BMP4 was found to have a central position in this OTM-related protein network. CONCLUSIONS: The placement of a fixed orthodontic appliance induced occurrence of proteins involved in bone remodeling in the saliva at a time corresponding to the post-lag period of OTM. Limitations of this study include a relatively small sample size, limited time of monitoring patients, and the lack of interindividual variability assessment.
PXD023076	34252326	Chronic binge alcohol and ovariectomy dysregulate omental adipose tissue metaboproteome in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected female macaques. 	Omental adipose tissue metaboproteome: differential dysregulation by chronic binge alcohol and ovariectomy in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected female macaques	adipose alcohol ovariectomy SIV macaques LC-MS TMTpro	Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced mortality of people living with HIV (PLWH), and the prevalence of at-risk alcohol use is higher among PLWH. Increased survival and aging of PLWH is associated with increased prevalence of metabolic comorbidities especially among menopausal women, and adipose tissue metabolic dysregulation may be a significant contributing factor. We examined the differential effects of chronic binge alcohol (CBA) administration and ovariectomy (OVX) on the omental adipose tissue (OmAT) proteome in a subset of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques of a longitudinal parent study. Quantitative discovery-based proteomics identified 1,429 differentially expressed proteins. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to calculate z-scores, or activation predictions, for functional pathways and diseases. Results revealed that protein changes associated with functional pathways centered around the "OmAT metaboproteome profile." Based on z-scores, CBA did not affect functional pathways of metabolic disease but dysregulated proteins involved in adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and lipid metabolism. OVX-mediated proteome changes were predicted to promote pathways involved in glucose- and lipid-associated metabolic disease. Proteins involved in apoptosis, necrosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways were also predicted to be activated by OVX and these were predicted to be inhibited by CBA. These results provide evidence for the role of ovarian hormone loss in mediating OmAT metaboproteome dysregulation in SIV and suggest that CBA modifies OVX-associated changes. In the context of OVX, CBA administration produced larger metabolic and cellular effects, which we speculate may reflect a protective role of estrogen against CBA-mediated adipose tissue injury in female SIV-infected macaques.
PXD025114	34252711	Targeting IFN-gamma-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase overcomes chemoresistance in AML through regulating the ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage. 	Targeting IFN-gamma-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase Overcomes Chemoresistance in AML through Regulating the ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage	AML, GILT, LSC, NRF2, ROS, chemoresistance, mitochondrial damage	The persistence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) is one of the leading causes of chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To explore the factors important in LSC-mediated resistance, we use mass spectrometry to screen the factors related to LSC chemoresistance and defined IFN-gamma-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) as a candidate. We found that the GILT expression was upregulated in chemoresistant CD34+ AML cells. Loss of function studies demonstrated that silencing of GILT in AML cells sensitized them to Ara-C treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic findings revealed that the ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage plays a pivotal role in inducing apoptosis of GILT-inhibited AML cells after Ara-C treatment. The inactivation of PI3K/Akt/ nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway, causing reduced generation of antioxidants such as SOD2 and leading to a shifted ratio of GSH/GSSG to the oxidized form, contributed to the over-physiological oxidative status in the absence of GILT. The prognostic value of GILT was also validated in AML patients. Taken together, our work demonstrated that the inhibition of GILT increases AML chemo-sensitivity through elevating ROS level and induce oxidative mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis, and inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NRF2 pathway enhances the intracellular oxidative state by disrupting redox homeostasis, providing a potentially effective way to overcome chemoresistance of AML.
PXD022106	34252907	Antagonism of the mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimer enhances opioid antinociception by activating Src and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II signaling. 	Antagonism of the Mu-Delta Opioid Receptor Heterodimer Enhances Opioid Anti-Nociception by Activating Src and CaMKII Signaling	opiod MDOR oxymorphone nociception	ABSTRACT: The opioid receptors are important regulators of pain, reward, and addiction. Limited evidence suggests the mu and delta opioid receptors form a heterodimer (MDOR), which may act as a negative feedback brake on opioid-induced analgesia. However, evidence for the MDOR in vivo is indirect and limited, and there are few selective tools available. We recently published the first MDOR-selective antagonist, D24M, allowing us to test the role of the MDOR in mice. We thus cotreated CD-1 mice with D24M and opioids in tail flick, paw incision, and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain models. D24M treatment enhanced oxymorphone antinociception in all models by 54.7% to 628%. This enhancement could not be replicated with the mu and delta selective antagonists CTAP, naltrindole, and naloxonazine, and D24M had a mild transient effect in the rotarod test, suggesting this increase is selective to the MDOR. However, D24M had no effect on morphine or buprenorphine, suggesting that only specific opioids interact with the MDOR. To find a mechanism, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis on brainstems of mice. We found that the kinases Src and CaMKII were repressed by oxymorphone, which was restored by D24M. We were able to confirm the role of Src and CaMKII in D24M-enhanced antinociception using small molecule inhibitors (KN93 and Src-I1). Together, these results provide direct in vivo evidence that the MDOR acts as an opioid negative feedback brake, which occurs through the repression of Src and CaMKII signal transduction. These results further suggest that MDOR antagonism could be a means to improve clinical opioid therapy.
PXD017903	34253062	CdrS Is a Global Transcriptional Regulator Influencing Cell Division in Haloferax volcanii. 	The small protein CdrS is involved in cell division regulation	CRISPRi, LC-MS, archaea, cell division, cell morphology, cytosol, membrane, small proteins, transcriptomics	Transcriptional regulators that integrate cellular and environmental signals to control cell division are well known in bacteria and eukaryotes, but their existence is poorly understood in archaea. We identified a conserved gene (cdrS) that encodes a small protein and is highly transcribed in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. The cdrS gene could not be deleted, but CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated repression of the cdrS gene caused slow growth and cell division defects and changed the expression of multiple genes and their products associated with cell division, protein degradation, and metabolism. Consistent with this complex regulatory network, overexpression of cdrS inhibited cell division, whereas overexpression of the operon encoding both CdrS and a tubulin-like cell division protein (FtsZ2) stimulated division. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) identified 18 DNA-binding sites of the CdrS protein, including one upstream of the promoter for a cell division gene, ftsZ1, and another upstream of the essential gene dacZ, encoding diadenylate cyclase involved in c-di-AMP signaling, which is implicated in the regulation of cell division. These findings suggest that CdrS is a transcription factor that plays a central role in a regulatory network coordinating metabolism and cell division. IMPORTANCE Cell division is a central mechanism of life and is essential for growth and development. Members of the Bacteria and Eukarya have different mechanisms for cell division, which have been studied in detail. In contrast, cell division in members of the Archaea is still understudied, and its regulation is poorly understood. Interestingly, different cell division machineries appear in members of the Archaea, with the Euryarchaeota using a cell division apparatus based on the tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein FtsZ, as in bacteria. Here, we identify the small protein CdrS as essential for survival and a central regulator of cell division in the euryarchaeon Haloferax volcanii. CdrS also appears to coordinate other cellular pathways, including synthesis of signaling molecules and protein degradation. Our results show that CdrS plays a sophisticated role in cell division, including regulation of numerous associated genes. These findings are expected to initiate investigations into conditional regulation of division in archaea.
PXD023441	34253290	Akt phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate to limit PI3K-mediated PIP3 synthesis. 	Akt phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate (IRS) to limit PI3K-mediated PI(3,4,5)P3 synthesis	AKT, IRS1, IRS2, PI3K, phosphorylation, signal transduction	The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt network is tightly controlled by feedback mechanisms that regulate signal flow and ensure signal fidelity. A rapid overshoot in insulin-stimulated recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane has previously been reported, which is indicative of negative feedback operating on acute timescales. Here, we show that Akt itself engages this negative feedback by phosphorylating insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 and 2 on a number of residues. Phosphorylation results in the depletion of plasma membrane-localised IRS1/2, reducing the pool available for interaction with the insulin receptor. Together these events limit plasma membrane-associated PI3K and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) synthesis. We identified two Akt-dependent phosphorylation sites in IRS2 at S306 (S303 in mouse) and S577 (S573 in mouse) that are key drivers of this negative feedback. These findings establish a novel mechanism by which the kinase Akt acutely controls PIP3 abundance, through post-translational modification of the IRS scaffold.
PXD022550	34254058	Cov-MS: A Community-Based Template Assay for Mass-Spectrometry-Based Protein Detection in SARS-CoV-2 Patients. 	Cov-MS: a community-based template assay for clinical MS-based protein detection in Sars-Cov-2 patients	Covid-19, DDA, EPIC-XS, Narrow-Window DIA, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SARS-COV2	Rising population density and global mobility are among the reasons why pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, spread so rapidly across the globe. The policy response to such pandemics will always have to include accurate monitoring of the spread, as this provides one of the few alternatives to total lockdown. However, COVID-19 diagnosis is currently performed almost exclusively by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Although this is efficient, automatable, and acceptably cheap, reliance on one type of technology comes with serious caveats, as illustrated by recurring reagent and test shortages. We therefore developed an alternative diagnostic test that detects proteolytically digested SARS-CoV-2 proteins using mass spectrometry (MS). We established the Cov-MS consortium, consisting of 15 academic laboratories and several industrial partners to increase applicability, accessibility, sensitivity, and robustness of this kind of SARS-CoV-2 detection. This, in turn, gave rise to the Cov-MS Digital Incubator that allows other laboratories to join the effort, navigate, and share their optimizations and translate the assay into their clinic. As this test relies on viral proteins instead of RNA, it provides an orthogonal and complementary approach to RT-PCR using other reagents that are relatively inexpensive and widely available, as well as orthogonally skilled personnel and different instruments. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022550.
PXD019520	34257281	Global kinome profiling reveals DYRK1A as critical activator of the human mitochondrial import machinery. 	Control of the mitochondrial carrier import pathway by DYRK1A	TOM70, mitochondria, phosphoproteomics	The translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane TOM constitutes the organellar entry gate for nearly all precursor proteins synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes. Thus, TOM presents the ideal target to adjust the mitochondrial proteome upon changing cellular demands. Here, we identify that the import receptor TOM70 is targeted by the kinase DYRK1A and that this modification plays a critical role in the activation of the carrier import pathway. Phosphorylation of TOM70(Ser91) by DYRK1A stimulates interaction of TOM70 with the core TOM translocase. This enables transfer of receptor-bound precursors to the translocation pore and initiates their import. Consequently, loss of TOM70(Ser91) phosphorylation results in a strong decrease in import capacity of metabolite carriers. Inhibition of DYRK1A impairs mitochondrial structure and function and elicits a protective transcriptional response to maintain a functional import machinery. The DYRK1A-TOM70 axis will enable insights into disease mechanisms caused by dysfunctional DYRK1A, including autism spectrum disorder, microcephaly and Down syndrome.
PXD025891	34257288	IL-15 and PIM kinases direct the metabolic programming of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. 	Comprehensive proteomics analyses of IL-15 driven activation of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes	Coeliac disease, Interleukin-15, Intraepithelial lymphocytes, LFQ, histone ruler, quantitative proteomics	Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are an abundant population of tissue-resident T cells that protect and maintain the intestinal barrier. IEL respond to epithelial cell-derived IL-15, which is complexed to the IL-15 receptor alpha chain (IL-15/Ralpha). IL-15 is essential both for maintaining IEL homeostasis and inducing IEL responses to epithelial stress, which has been associated with Coeliac disease. Here, we apply quantitative mass spectrometry to IL-15/Ralpha-stimulated IEL to investigate how IL-15 directly regulates inflammatory functions of IEL. IL-15/Ralpha drives IEL activation through cell cycle regulation, upregulation of metabolic machinery and expression of a select repertoire of cell surface receptors. IL-15/Ralpha selectively upregulates the Ser/Thr kinases PIM1 and PIM2, which are essential for IEL to proliferate, grow and upregulate granzyme B in response to inflammatory IL-15. Notably, IEL from patients with Coeliac disease have high PIM expression. Together, these data indicate PIM kinases as important effectors of IEL responses to inflammatory IL-15.
PXD023055	34258168	Diclofenac Resensitizes Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus to beta-Lactams and Prevents Implant Infections. 	Diclofenac Re-sensitizes Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to beta-lactam Antibiotics and Prevents Implant Infections	biofilm, diclofenac, implant infection, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin	Implant infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can cause major complications during the perioperative period. Diclofenac, one of the most widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is often used to relieve pain and inflammation. In this study, it is found that high-dose diclofenac can inhibit the growth of MRSA, and does not easily induce drug-resistant mutations after continuous passage. However, low-doses diclofenac can resensitize bacteria to beta-lactams, which help to circumvent drug resistance and improve the antibacterial efficacy of conventional antibiotics. Further, low-dose diclofenac in combination with beta-lactams inhibit MRSA associated biofilm formation in implants. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses indicate that diclofenac can reduce the expression of genes and proteins associated with beta-lactam resistance: mecA, mecR, and blaZ; peptidoglycan biosynthesis: murA, murC, femA, and femB; and biofilm formation: altE and fnbP. Murine implant infection models indicate that diclofenac combined with beta-lactams, can substantially alleviate MRSA infections in vivo. In addition, it is investigated that low dose diclofenac can inhibit MRSA antibiotic resistance via the mecA/blaZ pathway and related biofilms in implants. The synergistic effect of diclofenac and beta-lactams might have promising applications for preventing perioperative infection, considering its multitarget effects against MRSA.
PXD019999	34258881	Mechanistic insights into p53-regulated cytotoxicity of combined entinostat and irinotecan against colorectal cancer cells. 	p53 C-terminal acetylation modulates apoptotic program	Acetylation, C-terminus, DNA damage response (DDR), Parallel Reaction Monitoring, apoptosis, mitochondria, p53	Late-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) is still a clinically challenging problem. The activity of the tumor suppressor p53 is regulated via post-translational modifications (PTMs). While the relevance of p53 C-terminal acetylation for transcriptional regulation is well defined, it is unknown whether this PTM controls mitochondrially mediated apoptosis directly. We used wild-type p53 or p53-negative human CRC cells, cells with acetylation-defective p53, transformation assays, CRC organoids, and xenograft mouse models to assess how p53 acetylation determines cellular stress responses. The topoisomerase-1 inhibitor irinotecan induces acetylation of several lysine residues within p53. Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) with the class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat synergistically triggers mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in irinotecan-treated p53-positive CRC cells. This specifically relies on the C-terminal acetylation of p53 by CREB-binding protein/p300 and the presence of C-terminally acetylated p53 in complex with the proapoptotic BCL2 antagonist/killer protein. This control of C-terminal acetylation by HDACs can mechanistically explain why combinations of irinotecan and entinostat represent clinically tractable agents for the therapy of p53-proficient CRC.
PXD024415	34260243	An Integrated Approach for Discovering Noncanonical MHC-I Peptides Encoded by Small Open Reading Frames. 	Discovery of Non-Canonical Peptides Derived from Novel Small Open Reading Frames as MHC-I Epitopes	LC-MS, MHC-I, PRICE, RiboTISH, non-canonical peptides, sORF	MHC-I peptides are a group of important immunopeptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the cell surface for immune recognition. The majority of reported MHC-I peptides are derived from protein coding sequences, and noncanonical peptides translated from small open reading frames (sORF) are largely unknown due to the lack of accurate and sensitive detection methods. Herein we report an efficient approach that implements complementary bioinformatic strategies to improve the identification of noncanonical MHC-I peptides. In a database search strategy, noncanonical immunopeptides mapping was optimized by combining three complementary pipelines to construct predicted sORF databases from Ribo-seq data. In a de novo peptide sequencing strategy, MS data search results were filtered against sORF databases to pin down additional noncanonical immunopeptides. In total, 308 noncanonical immunopeptides were identified from two tumor cell lines with selected ones vigorously validated. Our approach is a handy solution to identify noncanonical MHC peptides with Ribo-seq and MS data. Meanwhile, the novel noncanonical immunopeptides identified with this method could shed insights on fundamental immunology as well as cancer immunotherapies.
PXD026875	34260257	Applying Log-Normal Peak Fitting to Parallel Reaction Monitoring Data Analysis. 	Applying log-normal peak fitting to parallel reaction monitoring data analysis.	Parallel reaction monitoring, data processing, peak fitting, peak modelling, software tool	Chromatographic separation is often an important part of mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. It reduces the complexity of the initial samples before they are introduced to mass-spectrometric detection and chromatographic characteristics (such as retention time) add analytical features to the analyte. The acquisition and analysis of chromatographic data are thus of great importance, and specialized software is used for the extraction of quantitative information in an efficient and optimized manner. However, occasionally, automatic peak picking and correct peak boundary setting is challenged by, for instance, aberration of peak shape, peak truncation, and peak tailing, and a manual review of a large number of peaks is frequently required. To support this part of the analysis, we present here a software tool, Peakfit, that fits acquired chromatographic data to the log-normal peak equation and reports the calculated peak parameters. The program is written in R and can easily be integrated into Skyline, a popular software packages that is frequently used for proteomic parallel reaction monitoring applications. The program is capable of processing large data sets (>10 000 peaks) and detecting sporadic outliers in peak boundary selection performed, for instance, in Skyline. In an example data set, available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026875, we demonstrated the capability of the program to characterize chromatographic peaks and showed an example of its ability to objectively and reproducibly detect and solve problematic peak-picking situations.
PXD026284	34260931	Human oncoprotein 5MP suppresses general and repeat-associated non-AUG translation via eIF3 by a common mechanism. 	Mass spectrometry analysis of FLAG-5MP complexes	eIF5-mimic protein (5MP)	eIF5-mimic protein (5MP) is a translational regulatory protein that binds the small ribosomal subunit and modulates its activity. 5MP is proposed to reprogram non-AUG translation rates for oncogenes in cancer, but its role in controlling non-AUG initiated synthesis of deleterious repeat-peptide products, such as FMRpolyG observed in fragile-X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), is unknown. Here, we show that 5MP can suppress both general and repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation by a common mechanism in a manner dependent on its interaction with eIF3. Essentially, 5MP displaces eIF5 through the eIF3c subunit within the preinitiation complex (PIC), thereby increasing the accuracy of initiation. In Drosophila, 5MP/Kra represses neuronal toxicity and enhances the lifespan in an FXTAS disease model. These results implicate 5MP in protecting cells from unwanted byproducts of non-AUG translation in neurodegeneration.
PXD023466	34260948	Beyond factor H: The impact of genetic-risk variants for age-related macular degeneration on circulating factor-H-like 1 and factor-H-related protein concentrations. 	Factor H and related proteins in AMD	AMD, FHL-1, Factor H	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss; there is strong genetic susceptibility at the complement factor H (CFH) locus. This locus encodes a series of complement regulators: factor H (FH), a splice variant factor-H-like 1 (FHL-1), and five factor-H-related proteins (FHR-1 to FHR-5), all involved in the regulation of complement factor C3b turnover. Little is known about how AMD-associated variants at this locus might influence FHL-1 and FHR protein concentrations. We have used a bespoke targeted mass-spectrometry assay to measure the circulating concentrations of all seven complement regulators and demonstrated elevated concentrations in 352 advanced AMD-affected individuals for all FHR proteins (FHR-1, p = 2.4 x 10(-10); FHR-2, p = 6.0 x 10(-10); FHR-3, p = 1.5 x 10(-5); FHR-4, p = 1.3 x 10(-3); FHR-5, p = 1.9 x 10(-4)) and FHL-1 (p = 4.9 x 10(-4)) when these individuals were compared to 252 controls, whereas no difference was seen for FH (p = 0.94). Genome-wide association analyses in controls revealed genome-wide-significant signals at the CFH locus for all five FHR proteins, and univariate Mendelian-randomization analyses strongly supported the association of FHR-1, FHR-2, FHR-4, and FHR-5 with AMD susceptibility. These findings provide a strong biochemical explanation for how genetically driven alterations in circulating FHR proteins could be major drivers of AMD and highlight the need for research into FHR protein modulation as a viable therapeutic avenue for AMD.
PXD025289	34261699	Mitochondrial Proteostasis Requires Genes Encoded in a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome Locus. 	Mitochondrial Proteostasis Requires Genes Encoded in a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome Locus	FAIMS, Orbitrap	Eukaryotic cells maintain proteostasis through mechanisms that require cytoplasmic and mitochondrial translation. Genetic defects affecting cytoplasmic translation perturb synapse development, neurotransmission, and are causative of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome. In contrast, there is little indication that mitochondrial proteostasis, either in the form of mitochondrial protein translation and/or degradation, is required for synapse development and function. Here we focus on two genes deleted in a recurrent copy number variation causing neurodevelopmental disorders, the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome. We demonstrate that SLC25A1 and MRPL40, two genes present in the microdeleted segment and whose products localize to mitochondria, interact and are necessary for mitochondrial ribosomal integrity and proteostasis. Our Drosophila studies show that mitochondrial ribosome function is necessary for synapse neurodevelopment, function, and behavior. We propose that mitochondrial proteostasis perturbations, either by genetic or environmental factors, are a pathogenic mechanism for neurodevelopmental disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The balance between cytoplasmic protein synthesis and degradation, or cytoplasmic proteostasis, is required for normal synapse function and neurodevelopment. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes are necessary for two compartmentalized, yet interdependent, forms of proteostasis. Proteostasis dependent on cytoplasmic ribosomes is a well-established target of genetic defects that cause neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism. Here we show that the mitochondrial ribosome is a neurodevelopmentally regulated organelle whose function is required for synapse development and function. We propose that defective mitochondrial proteostasis is a mechanism with the potential to contribute to neurodevelopmental disease.
PXD019215	34262173	Structures of rhodopsin in complex with G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 1. 	MC4 crosslinking of rhodopsin and GRK1 complex	Crosslinking, GPCR, GRK1, MC4, rhodopsin, rhodopsin kinase	G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) selectively phosphorylate activated GPCRs, thereby priming them for desensitization(1). Although it is unclear how GRKs recognize these receptors(2-4), a conserved region at the GRK N terminus is essential for this process(5-8). Here we report a series of cryo-electron microscopy single-particle reconstructions of light-activated rhodopsin (Rho*) bound to rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), wherein the N terminus of GRK1 forms a helix that docks into the open cytoplasmic cleft of Rho*. The helix also packs against the GRK1 kinase domain and stabilizes it in an active configuration. The complex is further stabilized by electrostatic interactions between basic residues that are conserved in most GPCRs and acidic residues that are conserved in GRKs. We did not observe any density for the regulator of G-protein signalling homology domain of GRK1 or the C terminus of rhodopsin. Crosslinking with mass spectrometry analysis confirmed these results and revealed dynamic behaviour in receptor-bound GRK1 that would allow the phosphorylation of multiple sites in the receptor tail. We have identified GRK1 residues whose mutation augments kinase activity and crosslinking with Rho*, as well as residues that are involved in activation by acidic phospholipids. From these data, we present a general model for how a small family of protein kinases can recognize and be activated by hundreds of different GPCRs.
PXD026321	34262452	Components and Pharmacodynamical Mechanism of Yinfupian Based on Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Analyses. 	Proteomic analysis of Fuzi and its processed products in treating Yang Deficiency Rats	Fuzi, Liver, Rat, Yang deficiency, Yinfupian	Objective: According to the treatment records of Yang deficiency syndrome (YDS) with characteristic decoction pieces of lateral root of Aconitum carmichaelii-Yinfupian (YF) in traditional Chinese medicine prepare school, known as "Jianchangbang". The aim of this study was to investigate differences in the composition and therapeutic mechanism of the unprocessed lateral root of Aconitum carmichaelii (ULRA) and its processed product (YF). Methods: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis method were used to determine and screen the main components of ULRA and YF. Changes in the histological structure and morphology of gonads in rats were observed using hematoxylin-eosin. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the contents of serum cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate in YDS rats treated with ULRA and YF. Tandem mass tag proteomics analysis was used to identify the differentially expressed proteins in YDS rats treated with ULRA and YF. Results: Both ULRA and YF exerted certain therapeutic effects on rats with YDS. They improved the gonadal morphology and increased the contents of serum cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. After processing of ULRA into YF, the content of C19-diester-diterpenoid alkaloids decreased (converted into C19-monoester-diterpenoid alkaloids and C19-alkylol amine-diterpenoid alkaloids), whereas that of C20-diterpene alkaloids increased. Proteomics analysis showed that cytochrome P450 and aldehyde oxidase 3 (AOX3) were downregulated, whereas cathepsin G (CTSG) was upregulated in rats with YDS. Treatment with ULRA mainly downregulated the expression of alpha-actinin, fast skeletal troponin, creatine kinase, and myosin. Treatment with YF mainly upregulated the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal protein and mitochondrial inner membrane protein. Conclusion: ULRA and YF exerted good therapeutic effects on YDS; the main difference in components between these preparations was in C19-diterpenoid alkaloids. ULRA mainly acts on the muscle contraction-related proteins and is closely related to inflammation and myocardial injury. YF mainly acts on the mitochondrial proteins and is closely related to adenosine triphosphate energy metabolism.
PXD024641	34262469	Quantitative Proteomics Reveal That Metabolic Improvement Contributes to the Cardioprotective Effect of T89 on Isoproterenol-Induced Cardiac Injury. 	rat myocardial left ventricular tissue proteins LC-MSMS	heart, rat	BACKGROUND: T89, a traditional Chinese medicine, has passed phase II, and is undergoing phase III clinical trials for treatment of ischemic cardiovascular disease by the US FDA. However, the role of T89 on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac injury is unknown. The present study aimed to explore the effect and underlying mechanism of T89 on ISO-induced cardiac injury. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received subcutaneous injection of ISO saline solution at 24 h intervals for the first 3 days and then at 48 h intervals for the next 12 days. T89 at dose of 111.6 and 167.4 mg/kg was administrated by gavage for 15 consecutive days. Rat survival rate, cardiac function evaluation, morphological observation, quantitative proteomics, and Western blotting analysis were performed. RESULTS: T89 obviously improved ISO-induced low survival rate, attenuated ISO-evoked cardiac injury, as evidenced by myocardial blood flow, heart function, and morphology. Quantitative proteomics revealed that the cardioprotective effect of T89 relied on the regulation of metabolic pathways, including glycolipid metabolism and energy metabolism. T89 inhibited the enhancement of glycolysis, promoted fatty acid oxidation, and restored mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by regulating Eno1, Mcee, Bdh1, Ces1c, Apoc2, Decr1, Acaa2, Cbr4, ND2, Cox 6a, Cox17, ATP5g, and ATP5j, thus alleviated oxidative stress and energy metabolism disorder and ameliorated cardiac injury after ISO. The present study also verified that T89 significantly restrained ISO-induced increase of HSP70/HSP40 and suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK, further restored the expression of CX43, confirming the protective role of T89 in cardiac hypertrophy. Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD024641. CONCLUSION: T89 reduced mortality and improves outcome in the model of ISO-induced cardiac injury and the cardioprotective role of T89 is correlated with the regulation of glycolipid metabolism, recovery of mitochondrial function, and improvement of myocardial energy.
PXD015449	34262947	Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Exosomes Attenuate Transverse Aortic Constriction Induced Heart Failure by Increasing Angiogenesis. 	Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of rat liver tissue	Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of rat liver tissue	Background: Although there are concerns regarding their clinical use, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) hold a great promise for cardiac repair. Exosomes deriving from ESCs constitute a promising alternative for heart restoration. However, their effects in hypertension-induced heart failure are still unknown. Objective and Methods: To investigate the effects of ESCs-derived exosomes on hypertension-induced heart failure and the underlying mechanisms, sustained transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was performed on 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice. After 1 months, ESCs-derived exosomes were isolated and injected intravenously once a week for 6 weeks. Echocardiography, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Masson staining, immunohistochemistry, and tube formation assays were all involved in our study. Results: Proteomics analyses revealed that ESC-derived exosomes contain FGF2 protein. Tube formation induced by these exosomes could be inhibited by FGF2R siRNA interference. ESCs-derived exosomes evidently attenuated TAC-induced heart failure, improving cardiac function and promoting myocardial angiogenesis which can be attenuated by selective FGF2 inhibitor AZD4547. Conclusions: ESC-derived exosomes attenuate TAC-induced heart failure mostly by promoting myocardial angiogenesis. FGF2 signaling plays a vital role in the myocardial angiogenesis induced by ESC-derived exosomes.
PXD019207	34263177	Functionally Essential Tubular Proteins Are Lost to Urine-Excreted, Large Extracellular Vesicles during Chronic Renal Insufficiency. 	Urine Large Extracellular Vesicle LC-MS/MS Data from a Chronic Kidney Disease Rat Model	Extracellular Vesicles, Kidney, Urine	BACKGROUND: The 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) rat model recapitulates many elements of human CKD. Within weeks of surgery, 5/6Nx rats spontaneously exhibit proximal tubular damage, including the production of very large extracellular vesicles and brush border shedding. We hypothesized that production and elimination of these structures, termed large renal tubular extracellular vesicles (LRT-EVs), into the urine represents a pathologic mechanism by which essential tubule proteins are lost. METHODS: LRT-EVs were isolated from 5/6Nx rat urine 10 weeks after surgery. LRT-EV diameters were measured. LRT-EV proteomic analysis was performed by tandem mass spectrometry. Data are available via the ProteomeXchange Consortium with identifier PXD019207. Kidney tissue pathology was evaluated by trichrome staining, TUNEL staining, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: LRT-EV size and a lack of TUNEL staining in 5/6Nx rats suggest LRT-EVs to be distinct from exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. LRT-EVs contained many proximal tubule proteins that, upon disruption, are known to contribute to CKD pathologic hallmarks. Select proteins included aquaporin 1, 16 members of the solute carrier family, basolateral Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase subunit ATP1A1, megalin, cubilin, and sodium-glucose cotransporters (SLC5A1 and SLC5A2). Histologic analysis confirmed the presence of apical membrane proteins in LRT-EVs and brush border loss in 5/6Nx rats. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides comprehensive proteomic analysis of a previously unreported category of extracellular vesicles associated with chronic renal stress. Because LRT-EVs contain proteins responsible for essential renal functions known to be compromised in CKD, their formation and excretion may represent an underappreciated pathogenic mechanism.
PXD024326	34263725	A plant-like mechanism coupling m6A reading to polyadenylation safeguards transcriptome integrity and developmental gene partitioning in Toxoplasma. 	Interactome of Toxoplasma gondii Pre-mRNA 3' Processing Complexes	3UTR, Toxoplasma gondii, interactomics, nanoLC-MS/MS, pre-mRNA processing	Correct 3'end processing of mRNAs is one of the regulatory cornerstones of gene expression. In a parasite that must adapt to the regulatory requirements of its multi-host life style, there is a need to adopt additional means to partition the distinct transcriptional signatures of the closely and tandemly arranged stage-specific genes. In this study, we report our findings in T. gondii of an m6A-dependent 3'end polyadenylation serving as a transcriptional barrier at these loci. We identify the core polyadenylation complex within T. gondii and establish CPSF4 as a reader for m6A-modified mRNAs, via a YTH domain within its C-terminus, a feature which is shared with plants. We bring evidence of the specificity of this interaction both biochemically, and by determining the crystal structure at high resolution of the T. gondii CPSF4-YTH in complex with an m6A-modified RNA. We show that the loss of m6A, both at the level of its deposition or its recognition is associated with an increase in aberrantly elongated chimeric mRNAs emanating from impaired transcriptional termination, a phenotype previously noticed in the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana. Nanopore direct RNA sequencing shows the occurrence of transcriptional read-through breaching into downstream repressed stage-specific genes, in the absence of either CPSF4 or the m6A RNA methylase components in both T. gondii and A. thaliana. Taken together, our results shed light on an essential regulatory mechanism coupling the pathways of m6A metabolism directly to the cleavage and polyadenylation processes, one that interestingly seem to serve, in both T. gondii and A. thaliana, as a guardian against aberrant transcriptional read-throughs.
PXD024581	34264749	Therapeutic Inhibition of Acid-Sensing Ion Channel 1a Recovers Heart Function After Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury. 	Therapeutic inhibition of acid sensing ion channel 1a recovers heart function after ischemia-reperfusion injury	Heart, human induced pluripotent stem cells, ischemia-reperfusion injury, therapeutic, venom	BACKGROUND: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the major risk factors implicated in morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. During cardiac ischemia, the buildup of acidic metabolites results in decreased intracellular and extracellular pH, which can reach as low as 6.0 to 6.5. The resulting tissue acidosis exacerbates ischemic injury and significantly affects cardiac function. METHODS: We used genetic and pharmacologic methods to investigate the role of acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) in cardiac IRI at the cellular and whole-organ level. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes as well as ex vivo and in vivo models of IRI were used to test the efficacy of ASIC1a inhibitors as pre- and postconditioning therapeutic agents. RESULTS: Analysis of human complex trait genetics indicates that variants in the ASIC1 genetic locus are significantly associated with cardiac and cerebrovascular ischemic injuries. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in vitro and murine ex vivo heart models, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of ASIC1a improves cardiomyocyte viability after acute IRI. Therapeutic blockade of ASIC1a using specific and potent pharmacologic inhibitors recapitulates this cardioprotective effect. We used an in vivo model of myocardial infarction and 2 models of ex vivo donor heart procurement and storage as clinical models to show that ASIC1a inhibition improves post-IRI cardiac viability. Use of ASIC1a inhibitors as preconditioning or postconditioning agents provided equivalent cardioprotection to benchmark drugs, including the sodium-hydrogen exchange inhibitor zoniporide. At the cellular and whole organ level, we show that acute exposure to ASIC1a inhibitors has no effect on cardiac ion channels regulating baseline electromechanical coupling and physiologic performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide compelling evidence for a novel pharmacologic strategy involving ASIC1a blockade as a cardioprotective therapy to improve the viability of hearts subjected to IRI.
PXD026471	34265272	CETSA interaction proteomics define specific RNA-modification pathways as key components of fluorouracil-based cancer drug cytotoxicity. 	IMPRINTS-CETSA, FUDR and FUR in MCF7 cells, 2h and 12h incubation	5-fluorouracil metabolites, FUDR, FUR, IMPRINTS-CETSA, MS-CETSA	The optimal use of many cancer drugs is hampered by a lack of detailed understanding of their mechanism of action (MoA). Here, we apply a high-resolution implementation of the proteome-wide cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) to follow protein interaction changes induced by the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and related nucleosides. We confirm anticipated effects on the known main target, thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and enzymes in pyrimidine metabolism and DNA damage pathways. However, most interaction changes we see are for proteins previously not associated with the MoA of 5-FU, including wide-ranging effects on RNA-modification and -processing pathways. Attenuated responses of specific proteins in a resistant cell model identify key components of the 5-FU MoA, where intriguingly the abrogation of TYMS inhibition is not required for cell proliferation.
PXD027696	34265469	Proteomic Landscape of Exosomes Reveals the Functional Contributions of CD151 in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer. 	Proteomic landscape of serum exosomes to identify potential therapeutic targets.	TNBC serum exosome proteomics	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Patients with TNBC have poor overall survival because of limited molecular therapeutic targets. Recently, exosomes have been recognized as key mediators in cancer progression, but the molecular components and function of TNBC-derived exosomes remain unknown. The main goal of this study was to reveal the proteomic landscape of serum exosomes derived from ten patients with TNBC and 17 healthy donors to identify potential therapeutic targets. Using a tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics approach, we characterized the proteomes of individual patient-derived serum exosomes, identified exosomal protein signatures specific to patients with TNBC, and filtered out differentially expressed proteins. Most importantly, we found that the tetraspanin CD151 expression levels in TNBC-derived serum exosomes were significantly higher than those exosomes from healthy subjects, and we validated our findings with samples from 16 additional donors. Furthermore, utilizing quantitative proteomics approach to reveal the proteomes of CD151-deleted exosomes and cells, we found that exosomal CD151 facilitated secretion of ribosomal proteins via exosomes while inhibiting exosome secretion of complement proteins. Moreover, we proved that CD151-deleted exosomes significantly decreased the migration and invasion of TNBC cells. This is the first comparative study of the proteomes of TNBC patient-derived and CD151-deleted exosomes. Our findings indicate that profiling of TNBC-derived exosomal proteins is a useful tool to extend our understanding of TNBC, and exosomal CD151 may be a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.
PXD024046	34269221	Gene and protein expression profiles of olfactory ensheathing cells from olfactory bulb versus olfactory mucosa. 	Comparative gene and protein expression profile of olfactory ensheathing cells from olfactory bulb and olfactory mucosa	Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), biological process, cellular component, gene, gene ontology (GO), kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), molecular function, olfactory bulb (OB), olfactory mucosa (OM), protein	Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) from the olfactory bulb (OB) and the olfactory mucosa (OM) have the capacity to repair nerve injury. However, the difference in the therapeutic effect between OB-derived OECs and OM-derived OECs remains unclear. In this study, we extracted OECs from OB and OM and compared the gene and protein expression profiles of the cells using transcriptomics and non-quantitative proteomics techniques. The results revealed that both OB-derived OECs and OM-derived OECs highly expressed genes and proteins that regulate cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis and vascular endothelial cell regeneration. The differentially expressed genes and proteins of OB-derived OECs play a key role in regulation of nerve regeneration and axon regeneration and extension, transmission of nerve impulses and response to axon injury. The differentially expressed genes and proteins of OM-derived OECs mainly participate in the positive regulation of inflammatory response, defense response, cytokine binding, cell migration and wound healing. These findings suggest that differentially expressed genes and proteins may explain why OB-derived OECs and OM-derived OECs exhibit different therapeutic roles. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University (approval No. 2017-073) on February 13, 2017.
PXD025342	34270261	Quantitative Proteomics Reveals the Protein Regulatory Network of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 under Nitrogen Deficiency. 	Quantitative proteomics of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 under nitrogen deficiency stress	Anabaena sp. PCC7120, Cyanobacteria, label-free proteome quantitation, nitrogen deficiency	Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 (Anabaena 7120) is a photoautotrophic filamentous cyanobacterium capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. It is a model organism used for studying cell differentiation and nitrogen fixation. Under nitrogen deficiency, Anabaena 7120 forms specialized heterocysts capable of nitrogen fixation. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the cyanobacterial adaptation to nitrogen deficiency are not well understood. Here, we employed a label-free quantitative proteomic strategy to systematically investigate the nitrogen deficiency response of Anabaena 7120 at different time points. In total, 363, 603, and 669 proteins showed significant changes in protein abundance under nitrogen deficiency for 3, 12, and 24 h, respectively. With mapping onto metabolic pathways, we revealed proteomic perturbation and regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in response to nitrogen deficiency. Functional analysis confirmed the involvement of nitrogen stress-responsive proteins in biological processes, including nitrogen fixation, photosynthesis, energy and carbon metabolism, and heterocyst development. The expression of 10 proteins at different time points was further validated by using multiple reaction monitoring assays. In particular, many dysregulated proteins were found to be time-specific and involved in heterocyst development, providing new candidates for future functional studies in this model cyanobacterium. These results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of nitrogen stress responses and heterocyst development in Anabaena 7120.
PXD028179	34270269	Performance Assessment of a 125 Human Plasma Peptide Mixture Stored at Room Temperature for Multiple Reaction Monitoring-Mass Spectrometry. 	2020_Human BAK125 kit _Room Temperature	MRM, internal standards, multiple reaction monitoring, peptide stability, targeted proteomics	Synthetic peptides are a critical requirement for the development and application of targeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based assays for the quantitation of proteins from biological matrices. Transporting synthetic peptides on dry ice from one laboratory to another is costly and often difficult because of country-specific import and export regulations. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the impact of leaving a lyophilized mixture consisting of 125 peptides at room temperature for up to 20 days, and we assessed the effect on the quantitative performance of multiple reaction monitoring-MS (MRM-MS) assays. The findings suggest that there are no significant differences in the MRM-MS results for the time points assessed in this study (up to 20 days). All the calibration curves and quality control (QC) samples met the acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy (raw data are available via the public MS data repository PanoramaWeb, identifier: /MRM Proteomics/2020_BAK125_RT). The number of endogenous proteins quantifiable across five plasma samples was consistently between 87 and 99 out of 125 for all time points. Moreover, the coefficients of variation (CVs) calculated for the majority of peptide concentrations across all samples and time points were <5%. In addition, a lyophilized peptide mixture was transported from Canada to Iceland without dry ice. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the quantitative performance, with the determined concentrations of most proteins in the samples falling within 30% between the analyses performed on the same three plasma samples in Iceland and those in Canada. Overall, a comparison of the results obtained in Canada and in Iceland indicated that the peptides were stable under the conditions tested and also indicated that shipping lyophilized peptide mixtures without dry ice, but in the presence of sufficient desiccant material, could be a feasible option in cases where transport difficulties may arise or dry-ice sublimation may occur.
PXD022904	34270554	Biochemical characterization of protease activity of Nsp3 from SARS-CoV-2 and its inhibition by nanobodies. 	Biochemical characterization of protease activity of Nsp3 from SARS-CoV-2 and its inhibition by nanobodies	Covid-19, ISG15, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, SARS CoV-2, Ubiqutylation	Of the 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) encoded by SARS CoV-2, Nsp3 is the largest and plays important roles in the viral life cycle. Being a large, multidomain, transmembrane protein, Nsp3 has been the most challenging Nsp to characterize. Encoded within Nsp3 is the papain-like protease domain (PLpro) that cleaves not only the viral polypeptide but also K48-linked polyubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier, ISG15, from host cell proteins. We here compare the interactors of PLpro and Nsp3 and find a largely overlapping interactome. Intriguingly, we find that near full length Nsp3 is a more active protease compared to the minimal catalytic domain of PLpro. Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC50s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. We therefore looked for alternative methods to block PLpro activity and engineered competitive nanobodies that bind to PLpro at the substrate binding site with nanomolar affinity thus inhibiting the enzyme. Our work highlights the importance of studying Nsp3 and provides tools and valuable insights to investigate Nsp3 biology during the viral infection cycle.
PXD022357	34270775	A co-fractionation mass spectrometry-based prediction of protein complex assemblies in the developing rice aleurone-subaleurone. 	A co-fractionation mass spectrometry-based prediction of protein complex assemblies in the developing rice aleurone-subaleurone	CF-MS, PCP, aleurone, composition, cytosolic, endosperm, prediction, protein complex, rice	Multiprotein complexes execute and coordinate diverse cellular processes such as organelle biogenesis, vesicle trafficking, cell signaling, and metabolism. Knowledge about their composition and localization provides useful clues about the mechanisms of cellular homeostasis and system-level control. This is of great biological importance and practical significance in heterotrophic rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm and aleurone-subaleurone tissues, which are a primary source of seed vitamins and stored energy. Dozens of protein complexes have been implicated in the synthesis, transport, and storage of seed proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals. Mutations in protein complexes that control RNA transport result in aberrant endosperm with shrunken and floury phenotypes, significantly reducing seed yield and quality. The purpose of this study was to broadly predict protein complex composition in the aleurone-subaleurone layers of developing rice seeds using co-fractionation mass spectrometry. Following orthogonal chromatographic separations of biological replicates, thousands of protein elution profiles were subjected to distance-based clustering to enable large-scale multimerization state measurements and protein complex predictions. The predicted complexes had predicted functions across diverse functional categories, including novel heteromeric RNA binding protein complexes that may influence seed quality. This effective and open-ended proteomics pipeline provides useful clues about system-level posttranslational control during the early stages of rice seed development.
PXD022989	34272370	Innate-like self-reactive B cells infiltrate human renal allografts during transplant rejection. 	Target search for self-reactive antibodies in human renal allograft rejection	Keywords: renal allograft rejection, LFQ, Q-Exactive, autoantibodies, inflammation, innate B cells, scRNA-seq, tolerance, transcription	Intrarenal B cells in human renal allografts indicate transplant recipients with a poor prognosis, but how these cells contribute to rejection is unclear. Here we show using single-cell RNA sequencing that intrarenal class-switched B cells have an innate cell transcriptional state resembling mouse peritoneal B1 or B-innate (Bin) cells. Antibodies generated by Bin cells do not bind donor-specific antigens nor are they enriched for reactivity to ubiquitously expressed self-antigens. Rather, Bin cells frequently express antibodies reactive with either renal-specific or inflammation-associated antigens. Furthermore, local antigens can drive Bin cell proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells expressing self-reactive antibodies. These data show a mechanism of human inflammation in which a breach in organ-restricted tolerance by infiltrating innate-like B cells drives local tissue destruction.
PXD018175	34272378	Complete loss of H3K9 methylation dissolves mouse heterochromatin organization. 	Complete loss of H3K9 methylation dissolves mouse heterochromatin organization	Proteomic quantification of H3K9 methylation, genome stability, heterochromatin organization, histone methyltransferases, repeat silencing	Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is a central epigenetic modification that defines heterochromatin from unicellular to multicellular organisms. In mammalian cells, H3K9 methylation can be catalyzed by at least six distinct SET domain enzymes: Suv39h1/Suv39h2, Eset1/Eset2 and G9a/Glp. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with a conditional mutation for Eset1 and introduced progressive deletions for the other SET domain genes by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Compound mutant MEFs for all six SET domain lysine methyltransferase (KMT) genes lack all H3K9 methylation states, derepress nearly all families of repeat elements and display genomic instabilities. Strikingly, the 6KO H3K9 KMT MEF cells no longer maintain heterochromatin organization and have lost electron-dense heterochromatin. This is a compelling analysis of H3K9 methylation-deficient mammalian chromatin and reveals a definitive function for H3K9 methylation in protecting heterochromatin organization and genome integrity.
PXD021924	34272384	Glucocorticoid receptor triggers a reversible drug-tolerant dormancy state with acquired therapeutic vulnerabilities in lung cancer. 	Glucocorticoid receptor triggers a reversible drug-tolerant dormancy state with acquired therapeutic vulnerabilities in lung cancer	CDKN1C, LFQ, Phosphoproteome, RIME, glucocorticoid receptor, lung cancer, protein p57	The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates gene expression, governing aspects of homeostasis, but is also involved in cancer. Pharmacological GR activation is frequently used to alleviate therapy-related side-effects. While prior studies have shown GR activation might also have anti-proliferative action on tumours, the underpinnings of glucocorticoid action and its direct effectors in non-lymphoid solid cancers remain elusive. Here, we study the mechanisms of glucocorticoid response, focusing on lung cancer. We show that GR activation induces reversible cancer cell dormancy characterised by anticancer drug tolerance, and activation of growth factor survival signalling accompanied by vulnerability to inhibitors. GR-induced dormancy is dependent on a single GR-target gene, CDKN1C, regulated through chromatin looping of a GR-occupied upstream distal enhancer in a SWI/SNF-dependent fashion. These insights illustrate the importance of GR signalling in non-lymphoid solid cancer biology, particularly in lung cancer, and warrant caution for use of glucocorticoids in treatment of anticancer therapy related side-effects.
PXD025820	34272394	The molecular basis of regulation of bacterial capsule assembly by Wzc. 	The molecular basis of regulation of bacterial capsule assembly by Wzc	E. coli, Phosphoproteomics, Tyrosine autokinase	Bacterial extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) play critical roles in virulence. Many bacteria assemble EPSs via a multi-protein "Wzx-Wzy" system, involving glycan polymerization at the outer face of the cytoplasmic/inner membrane. Gram-negative species couple polymerization with translocation across the periplasm and outer membrane and the master regulator of the system is the tyrosine autokinase, Wzc. This near atomic cryo-EM structure of dephosphorylated Wzc from E. coli shows an octameric assembly with a large central cavity formed by transmembrane helices. The tyrosine autokinase domain forms the cytoplasm region, while the periplasmic region contains small folded motifs and helical bundles. The helical bundles are essential for function, most likely through interaction with the outer membrane translocon, Wza. Autophosphorylation of the tyrosine-rich C-terminus of Wzc results in disassembly of the octamer into multiply phosphorylated monomers. We propose that the cycling between phosphorylated monomer and dephosphorylated octamer regulates glycan polymerization and translocation.
PXD024311	34272434	Proteomics and metabonomics analyses of Covid-19 complications in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. 	Proteomics and metabonomics analyses of Covid-19 complications in patients with pulmonary fibrosis	Covid-19, metabonomics, pulmonary fibrosis	Pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease, and the pathogenesis of this disease is not completely clear. Here, the medical records of 85 Covid-19 cases were collected, among which fibrosis and progression of fibrosis were analyzed in detail. Next, data independent acquisition (DIA) quantification proteomics and untargeted metabolomics were used to screen disease-related signaling pathways through clustering and enrichment analysis of the differential expression of proteins and metabolites. The main imaging features were lesions located in the bilateral lower lobes and involvement in five lobes. The closed association pathways were FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis, PPAR signaling, TRP-inflammatory pathways, and the urea cycle. Our results provide evidence for the detection of serum biomarkers and targeted therapy in patients with Covid-19.
PXD025208	34273398	BioID-Screening Identifies PEAK1 and SHP2 as Components of the ALK Proximitome in Neuroblastoma Cells. 	BioID-screening identifies PEAK1 and SHP2 as components of the Alk "proximitome" in neuroblastoma cells	BirA*, RMC-4550, SHP099, lorlatinib, signaling	Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is mutated in approximately 10% of pediatric neuroblastoma (NB). To shed light on ALK-driven signaling processes, we employed BioID-based in vivo proximity labeling to identify molecules that interact intracellularly with ALK. NB-derived SK-N-AS and SK-N-BE(2) cells expressing inducible ALK-BirA* fusion proteins were generated and stimulated with ALKAL ligands in the presence and absence of the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) lorlatinib. LC/MS-MS analysis identified multiple proteins, including PEAK1 and SHP2, which were validated as ALK interactors in NB cells. Further analysis of the ALK-SHP2 interaction confirmed that the ALK-SHP2 interaction as well as SHP2-Y542 phosphorylation was dependent on ALK activation. Use of the SHP2 inhibitors, SHP099 and RMC-4550, resulted in inhibition of cell growth in ALK-driven NB cells. In addition, we noted a strong synergistic effect of combined ALK and SHP2 inhibition that was specific to ALK-driven NB cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic option for ALK-driven NB.
PXD026238	34274450	PAD2-mediated citrullination of Fibulin-5 promotes elastogenesis. 	PAD2-mediated citrullination of Fibulin-5 promotes elastogenesis	Fibulin-5, citrullination, deiminase, deimination, elastic fiber, lung compliance	The formation of elastic fibers is active only in the perinatal period. How elastogenesis is developmentally regulated is not fully understood. Citrullination is a unique form of post-translational modification catalyzed by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), including PAD1-4. Its physiological role is largely unknown. By using an unbiased proteomic approach of lung tissues, we discovered that FBLN5 and LTBP4, two key elastogenic proteins, were temporally modified in mouse and human lungs. We further demonstrated that PAD2 citrullinated FBLN5 preferentially in young lungs compared to adult lungs. Genetic ablation of PAD2 resulted in attenuated elastogenesis in vitro and age-dependent emphysema in vivo. Mechanistically, citrullination protected FBLN5 from proteolysis and subsequent inactivation of its elastogenic activity. Furthermore, citrullinated but not native FBLN5 partially rescued in vitro elastogenesis in the absence of PAD activity. Our data uncover a novel function of citrullination, namely promoting elastogenesis, and provide additional insights to how elastogenesis is regulated.
PXD020677	34275329	Proteomic Signature of Dysfunctional Circulating Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells of Young Adults. 	Distinct phenotype and proteomic signature of peripheral blood-endothelial colony-forming cells of subjects with varied cardiovascular disease risks	Endothelial progenitor cells, cardiovascular disease	Background A subpopulation of endothelial progenitor cells called endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) may offer a platform for cellular assessment in clinical studies because of their remarkable angiogenic and expansion potentials in vitro. Despite endothelial cell function being influenced by cardiovascular risk factors, no studies have yet provided a comprehensive proteomic profile to distinguish functional (ie, more angiogenic and expansive cells) versus dysfunctional circulating ECFCs of young adults. The aim of this study was to provide a detailed proteomic comparison between functional and dysfunctional ECFCs. Methods and Results Peripheral blood ECFCs were isolated from 11 subjects (45% men, aged 27+/-5 years) using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. ECFCs expressed endothelial and progenitor surface markers and displayed cobblestone-patterned morphology with clonal and angiogenic capacities in vitro. ECFCs were deemed dysfunctional if <1 closed tube formed during the in vitro tube formation assay and proliferation rate was <20%. Hierarchical functional clustering revealed distinct ECFC proteomic signatures between functional and dysfunctional ECFCs with changes in cellular mechanisms involved in exocytosis, vesicle transport, extracellular matrix organization, cell metabolism, and apoptosis. Targeted antiangiogenic proteins in dysfunctional ECFCs included SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36), LUM (lumican), and PTX3 (pentraxin-related protein PYX3). Conclusions Circulating ECFCs with impaired angiogenesis and expansion capacities have a distinct proteomic profile and significant phenotype changes compared with highly angiogenic endothelial cells. Impaired angiogenesis in dysfunctional ECFCs may underlie the link between endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease risks in young adults.
PXD016981	34276900	LncRNA-encoded microproteins: A new form of cargo in cell culture-derived and circulating extracellular vesicles. 	Deeply mining a universe of peptides Encoded by Long Noncoding RNAs	SEPs, enrichment, lncRNA, smORF	Advancements in omics-based technologies over the past few years have led to the discovery of numerous biologically relevant peptides encoded by small open reading frames (smORFs) embedded in long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts (referred to as microproteins here) in a variety of species. However, the mechanisms and modes of action that underlie the roles of microproteins have yet to be fully characterized. Herein, we provide the first experimental evidence of abundant microproteins in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from glioma cancer cells, indicating that the EV-mediated transfer of microproteins may represent a novel mechanism for intercellular communication. Intriguingly, when examining human plasma, 48, 11 and 3 microproteins were identified from purified EVs, whole plasma and EV-free plasma, respectively, suggesting that circulating microproteins are primarily enriched in EVs. Most importantly, the preliminary data showed that the expression profile of EV microproteins in glioma patient diverged from the health donors, suggesting that the circulating microproteins in EVs might have potential diagnostic application in identifying patients with glioma.
PXD024446	34277544	Data-Independent Acquisition Proteomics Reveals Long-Term Biomarkers in the Serum of C57BL/6J Mice Following Local High-Dose Heart Irradiation. 	Proteomics on sera of mice following local high-dose heart irradiation	biomarker, cytokines, data-independent acquisition, heart, inflammation, ionizing radiation, radiation therapy	Background and Purpose: Cardiotoxicity is a well-known adverse effect of radiation therapy. Measurable abnormalities in the heart function indicate advanced and often irreversible heart damage. Therefore, early detection of cardiac toxicity is necessary to delay and alleviate the development of the disease. The present study investigated long-term serum proteome alterations following local heart irradiation using a mouse model with the aim to detect biomarkers of radiation-induced cardiac toxicity. Materials and Methods: Serum samples from C57BL/6J mice were collected 20 weeks after local heart irradiation with 8 or 16 Gy X-ray; the controls were sham-irradiated. The samples were analyzed by quantitative proteomics based on data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. The proteomics data were further investigated using bioinformatics and ELISA. Results: The analysis showed radiation-induced changes in the level of several serum proteins involved in the acute phase response, inflammation, and cholesterol metabolism. We found significantly enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, IL-1, and IL-6) in the serum of the irradiated mice. The level of free fatty acids, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and oxidized LDL was increased, whereas that of high-density lipoprotein was decreased by irradiation. Conclusions: This study provides information on systemic effects of heart irradiation. It elucidates a radiation fingerprint in the serum that may be used to elucidate adverse cardiac effects after radiation therapy.
PXD026954	34277623	Deciphering the in vivo Dynamic Proteomics of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Critical Limb Ischemia. 	dynamic proteomics of mesenchymal stem cells in critical limb ischemia	Mouse muscle MS	OBJECTIVE: Regenerative therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is a promising therapeutic method for critical limb ischemia (CLI). To understand how the cells are involved in the regenerative process of limb ischemia locally, we proposed a metabolic protein labeling method to label cell proteomes in situ and then decipher the proteome dynamics of MSCs in ischemic hind limb. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we overexpressed mutant methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS), which could utilize azidonorleucine (ANL) instead of methionine (Met) during protein synthesis in MSCs. Fluorescent non-canonical amino-acid tagging (FUNCAT) was performed to detect the utilization of ANL in mutant MSCs. Mice with hindlimb ischemia (HLI) or Sham surgery were treated with MetRS(mut) MSCs or PBS, followed by i.p. administration of ANL at days 0, 2 6, and 13 after surgery. FUNCAT was also performed in hindlimb tissue sections to demonstrate the incorporation of ANL in transplanted cells in situ. At days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after the surgery, laser doppler imaging were performed to detect the blood reperfusion of ischemic limbs. Ischemic tissues were also collected at these four time points for histological analysis including HE staining and vessel staining, and processed for click reaction based protein enrichment followed by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis. The MetRS(mut) MSCs showed strong green signal in cell culture and in HLI muscles as well, indicating efficient incorporation of ANL in nascent protein synthesis. By 14 days post-treatment, MSCs significantly increased blood reperfusion and vessel density, while reducing inflammation in HLI model compared to PBS. Proteins enriched by click reaction were distinctive in the HLI group vs. the Sham group. 34, 31, 49, and 26 proteins were significantly up-regulated whereas 28, 32, 62, and 27 proteins were significantly down-regulated in HLI vs. Sham at days 1, 3, 7, and 14, respectively. The differentially expressed proteins were more pronounced in the pathways of apoptosis and energy metabolism. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, mutant MetRS allows efficient and specific identification of dynamic cell proteomics in situ, which reflect the functions and adaptive changes of MSCs that may be leveraged to understand and improve stem cell therapy in critical limb ischemia.
PXD023900	34277700	Identification of Proteomic Signatures in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Emphysematous Phenotype. 	Proteomic signatures in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease emphysematous phenotype	COPD emphysematous phenotype, Lung tissue	Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly heterogeneous disease. Emphysematous phenotype is the most common and critical phenotype, which is characterized by progressive lung destruction and poor prognosis. However, the underlying mechanism of this structural damage has not been completely elucidated. A total of 12 patients with COPD emphysematous phenotype (COPD-E) and nine patients with COPD non-emphysematous phenotype (COPD-NE) were enrolled to determine differences in differential abundant protein (DAP) expression between both groups. Quantitative tandem mass tag-based proteomics was performed on lung tissue samples of all patients. A total of 29 and 15 lung tissue samples from patients in COPD-E and COPD-NE groups, respectively, were used as the validation cohort to verify the proteomic analysis results using western blotting. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted for DAPs. A total of 4,343 proteins were identified, of which 25 were upregulated and 11 were downregulated in the COPD-E group. GO and KEGG analyses showed that wound repair and retinol metabolism-related pathways play an essential role in the molecular mechanism of COPD emphysematous phenotype. Three proteins, namely, KRT17, DHRS9, and FMO3, were selected for validation. While KRT17 and DHRS9 were highly expressed in the lung tissue samples of the COPD-E group, FMO3 expression was not significantly different between both groups. In conclusion, KRT17 and DHRS9 are highly expressed in the lung tissue of patients with COPD emphysematous phenotype. Therefore, these proteins might involve in wound healing and retinol metabolism in patients with emphysematous phenotype and can be used as phenotype-specific markers.
PXD011434	34277994	The AGE receptor, OST48 drives podocyte foot process effacement and basement membrane expansion (alters structural composition). 	Glomerular and tubule OST48 Podocin-Cre SWATH	OST48, SWATH, glomerular, tubular	AIMS: The accumulation of advanced glycation end products is implicated in the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease. No study has examined whether stimulating advanced glycation clearance via receptor manipulation is reno-protective in diabetes. Podocytes, which are early contributors to diabetic kidney disease and could be a target for reno-protection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To examine the effects of increased podocyte oligosaccharyltransferase-48 on kidney function, glomerular sclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis and proteome (PXD011434), we generated a mouse with increased oligosaccharyltransferase-48kDa subunit abundance in podocytes driven by the podocin promoter. RESULTS: Despite increased urinary clearance of advanced glycation end products, we observed a decline in renal function, significant glomerular damage including glomerulosclerosis, collagen IV deposition, glomerular basement membrane thickening and foot process effacement and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Analysis of isolated glomeruli identified enrichment in proteins associated with collagen deposition, endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress. Ultra-resolution microscopy of podocytes revealed denudation of foot processes where there was co-localization of oligosaccharyltransferase-48kDa subunit and advanced glycation end-products. CONCLUSIONS: These studies indicate that increased podocyte expression of oligosaccharyltransferase-48 kDa subunit results in glomerular endoplasmic reticulum stress and a decline in kidney function.
PXD005943	34278261	Oxidative stress induces coordinated remodeling of RNA-enzyme interactions. 	Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRBPome in oxidative stress conditions	RBP, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, hydrogen peroxide, oxidative stress	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key post-transcriptional regulators that play a substantial role during stress adaptation. Recent proteome-wide surveys have uncovered a large number of new and "unconventional" RBPs such as metabolic enzymes, yet little is known about the reconfiguration of the RNA-binding proteome (RBPome) and RNA-enzyme interactions in response to cellular stress. Here, we applied RNA-interactome capture to monitor the dynamics of the mRBPome upon mild oxidative stress in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among the 257 proteins that significantly changed RNA associations, we observed the coordinated remodeling of RNA-binding enzymes - particularly of the central carbon metabolism - that complemented known metabolic responses. Furthermore, we recognized the propensity for paralogous specific alterations of enzyme-RNA interactions. Our results suggest coordinated cross talk between RNA-enzyme interactions and intermediary metabolism to maintain the physiological and molecular balance upon oxidative stress, perhaps through specialization of paralogous during evolution.
PXD026214	34281173	The Consequences of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase Deletion on Tumorigenesis and Metastasis in a Mouse Model of Breast Cancer. 	Consequences of sEH deletion in the polyoma middle T (PyMT) breast cancer tumor proteome	Lymphangiogenesis, breast cancer, macrophage, metastasis	Epoxides and diols of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are bioactive and can influence processes such as tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Studies with inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in animals overexpressing cytochrome P450 enzymes or following the systemic administration of specific epoxides revealed a markedly increased incidence of tumor metastases. To determine whether PUFA epoxides increased metastases in a model of spontaneous breast cancer, sEH(-/-) mice were crossed onto the polyoma middle T oncogene (PyMT) background. We found that the deletion of the sEH accelerated the growth of primary tumors and increased both the tumor macrophage count and angiogenesis. There were small differences in the epoxide/diol content of tumors, particularly in epoxyoctadecamonoenic acid versus dihydroxyoctadecenoic acid, and marked changes in the expression of proteins linked with cell proliferation and metabolism. However, there was no consequence of sEH inhibition on the formation of metastases in the lymph node or lung. Taken together, our results confirm previous reports of increased tumor growth in animals lacking sEH but fail to substantiate reports of enhanced lymph node or pulmonary metastases.
PXD021515	34282141	Specificities of exosome versus small ectosome secretion revealed by live intracellular tracking of CD63 and CD9. 	CD63/CD9-GFP extracellular vesicles LC-MS/MS	extracellular vesicles	Despite their roles in intercellular communications, the different populations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their secretion mechanisms are not fully characterized: how and to what extent EVs form as intraluminal vesicles of endocytic compartments (exosomes), or at the plasma membrane (PM) (ectosomes) remains unclear. Here we follow intracellular trafficking of the EV markers CD9 and CD63 from the endoplasmic reticulum to their residency compartment, respectively PM and late endosomes. We observe transient co-localization at both places, before they finally segregate. CD9 and a mutant CD63 stabilized at the PM are more abundantly released in EVs than CD63. Thus, in HeLa cells, ectosomes are more prominent than exosomes. By comparative proteomic analysis and differential response to neutralization of endosomal pH, we identify a few surface proteins likely specific of either exosomes (LAMP1) or ectosomes (BSG, SLC3A2). Our work sets the path for molecular and functional discrimination of exosomes and small ectosomes in any cell type.
PXD025786	34283050	Organ-Specific, Fibroblast-Derived Matrix as a Tool for Studying Breast Cancer Metastasis. 	Organ specific fibroblast-derived matrix as a tool for understanding breast cancer metastasis	LC-MS, fibroblasts, matrix	During the metastatic process, breast cancer cells must come into contact with the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) at every step. The ECM provides both structural support and biochemical cues, and cell-ECM interactions can lead to changes in drug response. Here, we used fibroblast-derived ECM (FDM) to perform high throughput drug screening of 4T1 breast cancer cells on metastatic organ ECM (lung), and we see that drug response differs from treatment on plastic. The FDMs that we can produce from different organs are abundant in and contains a complex mixture of ECM proteins. We also show differences in ECM composition between the primary site and secondary organ sites. Furthermore, we show that global kinase signalling of 4T1 cells on the ECM is relatively unchanged between organs, while changes in signalling compared to plastic are significant. Our study highlights the importance of context when testing drug response in vitro, showing that consideration of the ECM is critically important.
PXD026227	34283226	Ribosome heterogeneity in Drosophila melanogaster gonads through paralog-switching. 	Ribosome heterogeneity in Drosophila melanogaster gonads through paralog-switching	Drosophila melanogaster, TMT-MS, gonads, ovary, paralog, ribosome, testis	Ribosomes have long been thought of as homogeneous macromolecular machines, but recent evidence suggests they are heterogeneous and could be specialised to regulate translation. Here, we have characterised ribosomal protein heterogeneity across 4 tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. We find that testes and ovaries contain the most heterogeneous ribosome populations, which occurs through a combination of paralog-enrichment and paralog-switching. We have solved structures of ribosomes purified from in vivo tissues by cryo-EM, revealing differences in precise ribosomal arrangement for testis and ovary 80S ribosomes. Differences in the amino acid composition of paralog pairs and their localisation on the ribosome exterior indicate paralog-switching could alter the ribosome surface, enabling different proteins to regulate translation. One testis-specific paralog-switching pair is also found in humans, suggesting this is a conserved site of ribosome heterogeneity. Overall, this work allows us to propose that mRNA translation might be regulated in the gonads through ribosome heterogeneity, providing a potential means of ribosome specialisation.
PXD027323	34283812	PLA2G4A promotes right-sided colorectal cancer progression by inducing CD39+gammadelta Treg polarization. 	PLA2G4A promotes right-sided colorectal cancer progression by inducing CD39+gammadelta Tregs polarization	Colorectal cancer	The gammadelta T cell is a promising candidate cell in tumor immunotherapy. However, gammadelta T cells polarize to CD39+gammadelta Tregs upon colorectal cancer (CRC) induction, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the frequency of CD39+gammadelta Tregs, which positively correlated with poor prognosis, was significantly higher in right-sided CRC (RSCRC) than in the left-sided CRC (LSCRC). Interestingly, CD39+gammadelta Tregs from RSCRC showed stronger immunosuppressive phenotype and function than LSCRC. Furthermore, the quantitative mass spectrometry data show that CD39+gammadelta Treg polarization was related to the abnormal activation of the Phospholipase a2-IVa/Arachidonic acid (PLA2G4A/AA) metabolic pathway in RSCRC. Using an in vitro coculture system and an orthotopic murine model of CRC, we show that the overexpression of Pla2g4a in CT26 cells induced CD39+gammadelta Tregs, inhibiting the antitumor immune response. Finally, we found that the overall survival of the PLA2G4Ahi group was significantly shortened compared with PLA2G4Alo RSCRC, while the survival of LSCRC showed the opposite. Collectively, RSCRC with abnormal PLA2G4A expression educates gammadelta T cells into CD39+gammadelta Tregs to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Our work highlights the interaction between cancer cells and immune cells by distinguishing the primary tumor site and deepens the understanding of the tumor microenvironment and immunosuppression.
PXD024706	34284133	Comparative Secretome Analysis of Magnaporthe oryzae Identified Proteins Involved in Virulence and Cell Wall Integrity. 	Comparative secretome analysis of Magnaporthe oryzae identified N-glycosylation proteins involved in fungal pathogenicity and cell wall integrity	Magnaporthe oryzae, secretome analysis	Plant fungal pathogens secrete numerous proteins into the apoplast at the plant-fungus contact sites to facilitate colonization. However, only a few secretory proteins were functionally characterized in Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungal pathogen causing rice blast disease worldwide. Asparagine-linked glycosylation 3 (Alg3) is an alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase functioning in the N-glycan synthesis of N-glycosylated secretory proteins. Fungal pathogenicity and cell wall integrity are impaired in Deltaalg3 mutants, but the secreted proteins affected in Deltaalg3 mutants are largely unknown. In this study, we compared the secretomes of the wild-type strain and the Deltaalg3 mutant and identified 51 proteins that require Alg3 for proper secretion. These proteins were predicted to be involved in metabolic processes, interspecies interactions, cell wall organization, and response to chemicals. Nine proteins were selected for further validation. We found that these proteins were localized at the apoplastic region surrounding the fungal infection hyphae. Moreover, the N-glycosylation of these proteins was significantly changed in the Deltaalg3 mutant, leading to the decreased protein secretion and abnormal protein localization. Furthermore, we tested the biological functions of two genes, INV1 (encoding invertase 1, a secreted invertase) and AMCase (encoding acid mammalian chinitase, a secreted chitinase). The fungal virulence was significantly reduced, and the cell wall integrity was altered in the Deltainv1 and Deltaamcase mutant strains. Moreover, the N-glycosylation was essential for the function and secretion of AMCase. Taken together, our study provides new insight into the role of N-glycosylated secretory proteins in fungal virulence and cell wall integrity.
PXD025001	34285225	TGFbeta promotes fibrosis by MYST1-dependent epigenetic regulation of autophagy. 	ATG7KO SILAC Secretome_Proteome	ATG7KO, SILAC, autophagy, lung fibroblasts WI26	Activation of fibroblasts is essential for physiological tissue repair. Uncontrolled activation of fibroblasts, however, may lead to tissue fibrosis with organ dysfunction. Although several pathways capable of promoting fibroblast activation and tissue repair have been identified, their interplay in the context of chronic fibrotic diseases remains incompletely understood. Here, we provide evidence that transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) activates autophagy by an epigenetic mechanism to amplify its profibrotic effects. TGFbeta induces autophagy in fibrotic diseases by SMAD3-dependent downregulation of the H4K16 histone acetyltransferase MYST1, which regulates the expression of core components of the autophagy machinery such as ATG7 and BECLIN1. Activation of autophagy in fibroblasts promotes collagen release and is both, sufficient and required, to induce tissue fibrosis. Forced expression of MYST1 abrogates the stimulatory effects of TGFbeta on autophagy and re-establishes the epigenetic control of autophagy in fibrotic conditions. Interference with the aberrant activation of autophagy inhibits TGFbeta-induced fibroblast activation and ameliorates experimental dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. These findings link uncontrolled TGFbeta signaling to aberrant autophagy and deregulated epigenetics in fibrotic diseases and may contribute to the development of therapeutic interventions in fibrotic diseases.
PXD026685	34289347	Neuronal VCP loss of function recapitulates FTLD-TDP pathology. 	VCP loss of function in neurons recapitulates FTLD-TDP pathology	Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), VCP/p97, fronto-temporal lobar degeneration, transcriptomic	The pathogenic mechanism by which dominant mutations in VCP cause multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), a rare neurodegenerative disease that presents as fronto-temporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), remains unclear. To explore this, we inactivate VCP in murine postnatal forebrain neurons (VCP conditional knockout [cKO]). VCP cKO mice have cortical brain atrophy, neuronal loss, autophago-lysosomal dysfunction, and TDP-43 inclusions resembling FTLD-TDP pathology. Conditional expression of a single disease-associated mutation, VCP-R155C, in a VCP null background similarly recapitulates features of VCP inactivation and FTLD-TDP, suggesting that this MSP mutation is hypomorphic. Comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from genetically defined patients with FTLD-TDP reveal that progranulin deficiency and VCP insufficiency result in similar profiles. These data identify a loss of VCP-dependent functions as a mediator of FTLD-TDP and reveal an unexpected biochemical similarity with progranulin deficiency.
PXD018163	34289370	The histone chaperone HIR maintains chromatin states to control nitrogen assimilation and fungal virulence. 	Cell wall and secretome of Candida albicans WT, hir1delta/delta strain, and HIR1 complemented mutant	Candida albicans, SWATH, cell wall, secretome	Adaptation to changing environments and immune evasion is pivotal for fitness of pathogens. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Adaptation is governed by dynamic transcriptional re-programming, which is tightly connected to chromatin architecture. Here, we report a pivotal role for the HIR histone chaperone complex in modulating virulence of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Genetic ablation of HIR function alters chromatin accessibility linked to aberrant transcriptional responses to protein as nitrogen source. This accelerates metabolic adaptation and increases the release of extracellular proteases, which enables scavenging of alternative nitrogen sources. Furthermore, HIR controls fungal virulence, as HIR1 deletion leads to differential recognition by immune cells and hypervirulence in a mouse model of systemic infection. This work provides mechanistic insights into chromatin-coupled regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune pathogen gene expression and virulence. Furthermore, the data point toward the requirement of refined screening approaches to exploit chromatin modifications as antifungal strategies.
PXD022271	34289691	Quantitative Proteomics Reveals a Novel Role of the E3 Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase FANCL in the Activation of the Innate Immune Response through Regulation of TBK1 Phosphorylation during Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus Infection. 	Ubiquitin Ligase Enzyme FANCL Inhibits Peste des petits ruminants Virus Replication by Inducing Type I Interferon Production through Promoting Phosphorylation of TBK1	FANCL, Peste des petits ruminants virus, TBK1, innate immune response, quantitative proteomics	Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) infection causes considerable innate immunosuppression in its host, which promotes viral replication. However, how the host rescues the innate immune response to counteract this immunosuppression during viral replication remains largely unknown. To explore the mechanisms of how a host counteracts PPRV-mediated innate immunosuppression, a high-throughput quantitation proteomic approach (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation in conjunction with LC-MS/MS) was used to investigate the proteome landscape of goat fetal fibroblasts (GFFs) in response to PPRV infection. Eventually, 497 upregulated proteins and 358 downregulated proteins were identified. Many of the differentially expressed proteins were enriched in immune-related pathways. Blocking the activation of the innate immune response with a specific inhibitor BX795 in GFFs remarkably promoted PPRV replication, suggesting the significant antiviral role of the enriched immune-related pathways. The GO enrichment analysis showed that the host protein FANCL revealed a similar expression pattern to these innate immune-related proteins. In addition, the analysis of protein-protein interaction networks reveals a potential relationship between FANCL and the innate immune pathway. We determined that FANCL inhibited PPRV infection by enhancing type I interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated gene expression. Further investigation determined that FANCL induced type I IFN production by promoting TBK1 phosphorylation, thus impairing PPRV-mediated immunosuppression.
PXD027559	34290087	Multiregional profiling of the brain transmembrane proteome uncovers novel regulators of depression. 	Multiregional profiling of the brain transmembrane  proteome uncovers novel regulators of depression	Data-independent acquisition (DIA), G protein-coupled receptor, brain proteome, potential drug targets, transmembrane proteomics	Transmembrane proteins play vital roles in mediating synaptic transmission, plasticity, and homeostasis in the brain. However, these proteins, especially the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are underrepresented in most large-scale proteomic surveys. Here, we present a new proteomic approach aided by deep learning models for comprehensive profiling of transmembrane protein families in multiple mouse brain regions. Our multiregional proteome profiling highlights the considerable discrepancy between messenger RNA and protein distribution, especially for region-enriched GPCRs, and predicts an endogenous GPCR interaction network in the brain. Furthermore, our new approach reveals the transmembrane proteome remodeling landscape in the brain of a mouse depression model, which led to the identification of two previously unknown GPCR regulators of depressive-like behaviors. Our study provides an enabling technology and rich data resource to expand the understanding of transmembrane proteome organization and dynamics in the brain and accelerate the discovery of potential therapeutic targets for depression treatment.
PXD026097	34290093	Cryo-EM structure of the human ELMO1-DOCK5-Rac1 complex. 	Identification of the cross-linked ELMO1-DOCK5-Rac1 complex.	Crosslink mass spectrometry, XL-MS	The dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) promotes cell motility, phagocytosis, and cancer metastasis through activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases. Engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) proteins are binding partners of DOCK and regulate Rac activation. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the active ELMO1-DOCK5 complex bound to Rac1 at 3.8-Aa resolution. The C-terminal region of ELMO1, including the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, aids in the binding of the catalytic DOCK homology region 2 (DHR-2) domain of DOCK5 to Rac1 in its nucleotide-free state. A complex alpha-helical scaffold between ELMO1 and DOCK5 stabilizes the binding of Rac1. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the PH domain of ELMO1 enhances the GEF activity of DOCK5 through specific interactions with Rac1. The structure provides insights into how ELMO modulates the biochemical activity of DOCK and how Rac selectivity is achieved by ELMO.
PXD015865	34290243	3-hydroxy-L-kynurenamine is an immunomodulatory biogenic amine. 	Label free quantitative (LFQ) proteomic analysis of mouse lymphatic endothelial cells and primary mouse dendritic cells in response to IFNgamma treatment in presence or absence of 3-HKA	mouse lymphatic endotehlial cells (LEC), mouse primary dendritic cells (pDC), nanoLC-MS/MS	Tryptophan catabolism is a major metabolic pathway utilized by several professional and non-professional antigen presenting cells to maintain immunological tolerance. Here we report that 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenamine (3-HKA) is a biogenic amine produced via an alternative pathway of tryptophan metabolism. In vitro, 3-HKA has an anti-inflammatory profile by inhibiting the IFN-gamma mediated STAT1/NF-kappaBeta pathway in both mouse and human dendritic cells (DCs) with a consequent decrease in the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, most notably TNF, IL-6, and IL12p70. 3-HKA has protective effects in an experimental mouse model of psoriasis by decreasing skin thickness, erythema, scaling and fissuring, reducing TNF, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and IL-17 production, and inhibiting generation of effector CD8(+) T cells. Similarly, in a mouse model of nephrotoxic nephritis, besides reducing inflammatory cytokines, 3-HKA improves proteinuria and serum urea nitrogen, overall ameliorating immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and renal dysfunction. Overall, we propose that this biogenic amine is a crucial component of tryptophan-mediated immune tolerance.
PXD025659	34290676	Distinct Human Gut Microbial Taxonomic Signatures Uncovered With Different Sample Processing and Microbial Cell Disruption Methods for Metaproteomic Analysis. 	Evaluation of different protein extraction protocols to study human gut microbiota.	ProteomeXchange project tag: Human Proteome Project, cell disruption, comparison, metaproteomics, microbiota, processing, protein extraction	The use of metaproteomics for studying the human gut microbiota can shed light on the taxonomic profile and the functional role of the microbial community. Nevertheless, methods for extracting proteins from stool samples continue to evolve, in the pursuit of optimal protocols for moistening and dispersing the stool sample and for disrupting microbial cells, which are two critical steps for ensuring good protein recovery. Here, we evaluated different stool sample processing (SSP) and microbial cell disruption methods (CDMs). The combination of a longer disintegration period of the stool sample in a tube rotator with sonication increased the overall number of identified peptides and proteins. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, and Euryarchaeota identification was favored by mechanical cell disruption with glass beads. In contrast, the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria was improved when sonication was performed before bead beating. Tenericutes and Apicomplexa identification was enhanced by moistening the stool samples during processing and by disrupting cells with medium-sized glass beads combined with or without sonication. Human protein identifications were affected by sonication. To test the reproducibility of these gut metaproteomic analyses, we examined samples from six healthy individuals using a protocol that had shown a good taxonomic diversity and identification of proteins from Proteobacteria and humans. We also detected proteins involved in microbial functions relevant to the host and related mostly to specific taxa, such as B12 biosynthesis and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production carried out mainly by members in the Prevotella genus and the Firmicutes phylum, respectively. The taxonomic and functional profiles obtained with the different protocols described in this work provides the researcher with valuable information when choosing the most adequate protocol for the study of certain pathologies under suspicion of being related to a specific taxon from the gut microbiota.
PXD022073	34291801	Function of cofactor Akirin2 in the regulation of gene expression in model human Caucasian neutrophil-like HL60 cells. 	The Akirin2 regulome and interactome reveal gene/protein targets, candidate functional  complements and role in epigenetic regulation	Akirin2, HL60, interactome, knockdown, regulome	The Akirin family of transcription cofactors are involved throughout the metazoan in the regulation of different biological processes (BPs) such as immunity, interdigital regression, muscle and neural development. Akirin do not have catalytic or DNA-binding capability and exert its regulatory function primarily through interacting proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and RNA-associated proteins. In the present study, we focused on the human Akirin2 regulome and interactome in neutrophil-like model human Caucasian promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells. Our hypothesis is that metazoan evolved to have Akirin2 functional complements and different Akirin2-mediated mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression. To address this hypothesis, experiments were conducted using transcriptomics, proteomics and systems biology approaches in akirin2 knockdown and wildtype (WT) HL60 cells to characterize Akirin2 gene/protein targets, functional complements and to provide evidence of different mechanisms that may be involved in Akirin2-mediated regulation of gene expression. The results revealed Akirin2 gene/protein targets in multiple BPs with higher representation of immunity and identified immune response genes as candidate Akirin2 functional complements. In addition to linking chromatin remodelers with transcriptional activation, Akirin2 also interacts with histone H3.1 for regulation of gene expression.
PXD025971	34291903	Rapid Highly-Efficient Digestion and Peptide Mapping of Adeno-Associated Viruses. 	Rapid Highly-Efficient Digestion and Peptide Mapping of Adeno-Associated Viruses	AAV, Estee      Gene Therapy, Pepsin, Peptide Mapping, Trypsin, Viral Therapies, [15:18] Toole, nanoLC, proteolysis	Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) comprise an area of rapidly growing interest due to their ability to act as a gene delivery vehicle in novel gene therapy strategies and vaccine development. Peptide mapping is a common technique in the biopharmaceutical industry to confirm the correct sequence, product purity, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and stability. However, conventional peptide mapping is time-consuming and has proven difficult to reproduce with viral capsids because of their high structural stability and the suboptimal localization of trypsin cleavage sites in the AAV protein sequences. In this study, we present an optimized peptide mapping-based workflow that provides thorough characterization within 1 day. This workflow is also highly reproducible due to its simplicity having very few steps and is easy to perform proteolytic digestion utilizing thermally stable pepsin, which is active at 70 degreesC in acidic conditions. The acidic conditions of the peptic digestions drive viral capsid denaturation and improve cleavage site accessibility. We characterized the efficiency and ease of digestion through peptide mapping of the AAV2 viral capsid protein. Using nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, we achieved 100% sequence coverage of the low-abundance VP1 capsid protein with a digestion process taking only 10 min to prepare and 45 min to complete the digestion.
PXD025884	34292722	De Novo Sequencing of Antibody Light Chain Proteoforms from Patients with Multiple Myeloma. 	De novo sequencing of antibody light chain proteoforms from patients with multiple myeloma	ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, antibody, bottom-up proteomics, de novo sequencing, light chain disease, proteoforms, top-down proteomics	In multiple myeloma diseases, monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (LCs) are abundantly produced, with, as a consequence in some cases, the formation of deposits affecting various organs, such as the kidney, while in other cases remaining soluble up to concentrations of several g.L(-1) in plasma. The exact factors crucial for the solubility of LCs are poorly understood, but it can be hypothesized that their amino acid sequence plays an important role. Determining the precise sequences of patient-derived LCs is therefore highly desirable. We establish here a novel de novo sequencing workflow for patient-derived LCs, based on the combination of bottom-up and top-down proteomics without database search. PEAKS is used for the de novo sequencing of peptides that are further assembled into full length LC sequences using ALPS. Top-down proteomics provides the molecular masses of proteoforms and allows the exact determination of the amino acid sequence including all posttranslational modifications. This pipeline is then used for the complete de novo sequencing of LCs extracted from the urine of 10 patients with multiple myeloma. We show that for the bottom-up part, digestions with trypsin and Nepenthes digestive fluid are sufficient to produce overlapping peptides able to generate the best sequence candidates. Top-down proteomics is absolutely required to achieve 100% final sequence coverage and characterize clinical samples containing several LCs. Our work highlights an unexpected range of modifications.
PXD025277	34292740	DIA-Based Proteome Profiling of Nasopharyngeal Swabs from COVID-19 Patients. 	DIA-based proteome profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients	COVD-19, Covid-19, DIA, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, host response, nasopharyngeal swabs, timsTOF	Since the recent outbreak of COVID-19, there have been intense efforts to understand viral pathogenesis and host immune response to combat SARS-CoV-2. It has become evident that different host alterations can be identified in SARS-CoV-2 infection based on whether infected cells, animal models or clinical samples are studied. Although nasopharyngeal swabs are routinely collected for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR testing, host alterations in the nasopharynx at the proteomic level have not been systematically investigated. Thus, we sought to characterize the host response through global proteome profiling of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. A mass spectrometer combining trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) and high-resolution QTOF mass spectrometer with parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) was deployed for unbiased proteome profiling. First, deep proteome profiling of pooled nasopharyngeal swab samples was performed in the PASEF enabled DDA mode, which identified 7723 proteins that were then used to generate a spectral library. This approach provided peptide level evidence of five missing proteins for which MS/MS spectrum and mobilograms were validated with synthetic peptides. Subsequently, quantitative proteomic profiling was carried out for 90 individual nasopharyngeal swab samples (45 positive and 45 negative) in DIA combined with PASEF, termed as diaPASEF mode, which resulted in a total of 5023 protein identifications. Of these, 577 proteins were found to be upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Functional analysis of these upregulated proteins revealed alterations in several biological processes including innate immune response, viral protein assembly, and exocytosis. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to deploy diaPASEF for quantitative proteomic profiling of clinical samples and shows the feasibility of adopting such an approach to understand mechanisms and pathways altered in diseases.
PXD025110	34293822	The signal transducer CD24 suppresses the germ cell program and promotes an ectodermal rather than mesodermal cell fate in embryonal carcinomas. 	Molecular and epigenetic characterization of the signal transducer CD24 in germ cell tumors	CD24, differentiation, embryonal carcinoma, epigenetics, germ cell tumors, pluripotency	Testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) are stratified into seminomas and nonseminomas. Seminomas share many histological and molecular features with primordial germ cells, whereas the nonseminoma stem cell population-embryonal carcinoma (EC)-is pluripotent and thus able to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers (teratomas). Furthermore, ECs are capable of differentiating into extra-embryonic lineages (yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinomas). In this study, we deciphered the molecular and (epi)genetic mechanisms regulating expression of CD24, a highly glycosylated signaling molecule upregulated in many cancers. CD24 is overexpressed in ECs compared with other GCT entities and can be associated with an undifferentiated pluripotent cell fate. We demonstrate that CD24 can be transactivated by the pluripotency factor SOX2, which binds in proximity to the CD24 promoter. In GCTs, CD24 expression is controlled by epigenetic mechanisms, that is, histone acetylation, since CD24 can be induced by the application histone deacetylase inhibitors. Vice versa, CD24 expression is downregulated upon inhibition of histone methyltransferases, E3 ubiquitin ligases, or bromodomain (BRD) proteins. Additionally, three-dimensional (3D) co-cultivation of EC cells with microenvironmental cells, such as fibroblasts, and endothelial or immune cells, reduced CD24 expression, suggesting that crosstalk with the somatic microenvironment influences CD24 expression. In a CRISPR/Cas9 deficiency model, we demonstrate that CD24 fulfills a bivalent role in differentiation via regulation of homeobox, and phospho- and glycoproteins; that is, it is involved in suppressing the germ cell/spermatogenesis program and mesodermal/endodermal differentiation, while poising the cells for ectodermal differentiation. Finally, blocking CD24 by a monoclonal antibody enhanced sensitivity toward cisplatin in EC cells, including cisplatin-resistant subclones, highlighting CD24 as a putative target in combination with cisplatin.
PXD025605	34295249	The Protective Effect of Liquiritin in Hypoxia/Reoxygenation-Induced Disruption on Blood Brain Barrier. 	The protective effect of Liquiritin in hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced disruption on blood brain barrier	Brain, Cells, i-TRAQ	Background: Stroke is the second leading cause of death in human life health, but current treatment strategies are limited to thrombolytic therapy, and because of the tight time window, many contraindications, and only a very small number of people can benefit from it, new therapeutic strategies are needed to solve this problem. As a physical barrier between the central nervous system and blood, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintains the homeostasis of the central nervous system. Maintaining the integrity of the BBB may emerge as a new therapeutic strategy. Liquiritin (LQ) is a flavonoid isolated from the medicinal plant Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC. (Fabaceae), and this study aims to investigate the protective effects of LQ on brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), to provide a new therapeutic strategy for stroke treatment, and also to provide research ideas for the development of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Methods: The protective effects of LQ on HBMECs under the treatment of hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R) were investigated from different aspects by establishing a model of H/R injury to mimic ischemia-reperfusion in vivo while administrating different concentrations of LQ, which includes: cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, mitochondrial membrane potential as well as apoptosis. Meanwhile, the mechanism of LQ to protect the integrity of BBB by antioxidation and inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was also investigated. Finally, to search for possible targets of LQ, a proteomic analysis approach was employed. Results: LQ can promote cell proliferation, migration as well as angiogenesis and reduce mitochondrial membrane potential damage and apoptosis. Meanwhile, LQ can also reduce the expression of related adhesion molecules, and decrease the production of reactive oxygen species. In terms of mechanism study, we demonstrated that LQ could activate Keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, inhibit ER stress, and maintain the integrity of BBB. Through differential protein analysis, 5 disease associated proteins were found. Conclusions: Studies have shown that LQ can promote cell proliferation, migration as well as angiogenesis, and reduce cell apoptosis, which may be related to its inhibition of oxidative and ER stress, and then maintain the integrity of BBB. Given that five differential proteins were found by protein analysis, future studies will revolve around the five differential proteins.
PXD026728	34295519	RUFY4 exists as two translationally regulated isoforms, that localize to the mitochondrion in activated macrophages. 	Rufy4 exists as two translationally regulated isoforms, that localize  to the mitochondrion in activated macrophages	LPS, Mitophagy, Rufy4, SKP, alveolar macrophages	We report here that RUFY4, a newly characterized member of the 'RUN and FYVE domain-containing' family of proteins previously associated with autophagy enhancement, is highly expressed in alveolar macrophages (AM). We show that RUFY4 interacts with mitochondria upon stimulation by microbial-associated molecular patterns of AM and dendritic cells. RUFY4 interaction with mitochondria and other organelles is dependent on a previously uncharacterized OmpH domain located immediately upstream of its C-terminal FYVE domain. Further, we demonstrate that rufy4 messenger RNA can be translated from an alternative translation initiation codon, giving rise to a N-terminally truncated form of the molecule lacking most of its RUN domain and with enhanced potential for its interaction with mitochondria. Our observations point towards a role of RUFY4 in selective mitochondria clearance in activated phagocytes.
PXD023279	34295887	Dihydropyrimidinase Like 2 Promotes Bladder Cancer Progression via Pyruvate Kinase M2-Induced Aerobic Glycolysis and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition. 	Identification of proteins that interacted with DPYSL2	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), DPYSL2, Human Proteome Project, LS-MSMS, ProteomeXchange project tag: Cancer (B/D-HPP)	BACKGROUND: Aerobic glycolysis and epidermal-mesenchymal transition (EMT) play key roles in the development of bladder cancer. This study aimed to investigate the function and the underlying mechanism of dihydropyrimidinase like 2 (DPYSL2) in bladder cancer progression. METHODS: The expression pattern of DPYSL2 in bladder cancer and the correlation of DPYSL2 expression with clinicopathological characteristics of bladder cancer patients were analyzed using the data from different databases and tissue microarray. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed to explore the role of DPYSL2 in bladder cancer progression in vitro and in mice. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify the interacting partner of DPYSL2 in bladder cancer cells. FINDINGS: The results showed that DPYSL2 expression was upregulated in bladder cancer tissue compared with adjacent normal bladder tissue and in more aggressive cancer stages compared with lower stages. DPYSL2 promoted malignant behavior of bladder cancer cells in vitro, as well as tumor growth and distant metastasis in mice. Mechanistically, DPYSL2 interacted with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and promoted the conversion of PKM2 tetramers to PKM2 dimers. Knockdown of PKM2 completely blocked DPYSL2-induced enhancement of the malignant behavior, glucose uptake, lactic acid production, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in bladder cancer cells. INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, the results suggest that DPYSL2 promotes aerobic glycolysis and EMT in bladder cancer via PKM2, serving as a potential therapeutic target for bladder cancer treatment.
PXD023849	34296254	Proteomic and functional analysis of proteins related to embryonic development of decidua in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss+. 	Proteomic and functional analysis identifies proteins related to embryonic development in decidua of patients with early recurrent miscarriage	Decidua, Embryonic development, IPA, Recurrent miscarriage, TMT	Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined as the loss of two or more consecutive pregnancies before the 20 weeks of gestation. RPL affects about 1-2% of couples trying to conceive; however, the mechanisms leading to this complication are largely unknown. Our previous studies using comparative proteomics identified 314 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the placental villous. In this study, we identified 5479 proteins from a total of 34 157 peptides in decidua of patients with early RPL (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD023849). Further analysis identified 311 DEPs in the decidua tissue; and 159 proteins were highly expressed, whereas 152 proteins were lowly expressed. These 311 proteins were further analyzed by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The results suggested that 50 DEPs played important roles in the embryonic development. Upstream analysis of these DEPs revealed that angiotensinogen was the most important upstream regulator. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction analysis of the embryonic development DEPs from the placental villous and decidua was performed in the STRING database. This study identified several proteins specifically associated with embryonic development in decidua of patients with early RPL. Therefore, these results provide new insights into potential biological mechanisms, which may ultimately inform RPL.
PXD027135	34297524	Nanoparticle-Aided Nanoreactor for Nanoproteomics. 	Nanoparticle-aided nanoreactor for large-scale proteomics of few mammalian cells	bottom-up proteomics, few-cell proteomics, mass-limited sample, nanoparticle, nanoproteomics, nanoreactor, single-cell proteomics	Large-scale bottom-up proteomics of few even single cells is crucial for a better understanding of the roles played by cell-to-cell heterogeneity in disease and development. Novel proteomic methodologies with extremely high sensitivity are required for few even single-cell proteomics. Sample processing with high recovery and no contaminants is one key step. Here we developed a nanoparticle-aided nanoreactor for nanoproteomics (Nano3) technique for processing low-nanograms of mammalian cell proteins for proteome profiling. The Nano3 technique employed nanoparticles packed in a capillary channel to form a nanoreactor (<=30 nL) for concentrating, cleaning, and digesting proteins originally in a lysis buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), followed by nanoRPLC-MS/MS analysis. The Nano3 method identified a 40-times higher number of proteins based on MS/MS from 2-ng mouse brain protein samples compared to the SP3 (single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation) method, which performed the sample processing using the nanoparticles in a 10 muL solution in an Eppendorf tube. The data indicates a drastically higher sample recovery of the Nano3 compared to the SP3 method for processing mass-limited proteome samples. In this pilot study, the Nano3 method was further applied in processing 10-1000 HeLa cells for bottom-up proteomics, producing 441 +/- 263 (n = 4) (MS/MS) and 983 +/- 292 (n = 4) [match between runs (MBR)+MS/MS] protein identifications from only 10 HeLa cells using a Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer. The preliminary results render the Nano3 method a useful approach for processing few mammalian cells for proteome profiling.
PXD024573	34297549	SAPT, a Fast and Efficient Approach for Simultaneous Profiling of Protein N- and C-Terminome. 	SAPT, a fast and efficient approach for simultaneous profiling of protein N- and C-terminome	Hela cell, protein termini	Protein termini play pivotal roles in various biological processes. Although several terminomic strategies have been proposed for the analysis of protein N-termini or protein C-termini separately, few can analyze both ends of proteins at the same time. Herein, we developed a workflow, termed Simultaneous Analysis of Protein N- and C-Terminome (SAPT) based on strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) fractionation. Taking advantage of terminal peptides' reduced charge states in low pH SCX for their selective separation, we identified 3724 canonical human protein N-termini and 3129 canonical human protein C-termini, as well as 1463 neo-N-termini from the HeLa cell line, representing the largest human protein C-termini data set and the second largest human protein N-termini data set so far. The whole fractionation procedure was simple and rapid with considerable selectivity by utilizing a commercially available SCX-SPE column. In addition, we report for the first time the comprehensive screening of protein N-terminal and C-terminal modifications, leading to an identification of 8 kinds of protein N-terminal PTMs other than acetylation and 1 kind of protein C-terminal PTM other than amidation. Our results demonstrate the excellent performance and great potential of SAPT in terminomic studies. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD024573.
PXD022329	34298159	Unbiased Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Analysis Identifies Response Signatures and Novel Susceptibilities After Combined MEK and mTOR Inhibition in BRAF(V600E) Mutant Glioma. 	Unbiased proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis identifies response signatures and novel susceptibilities after combined MEK and mTOR inhibition in BRAFV600E mutant glioma	BRAF V600E, Glioma, INK128, MLN0128, TAK228, Trametinib, sapanisertib	The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is one of the most frequently altered pathways in cancer. It is involved in the control of cell proliferation, invasion, and metabolism, and can cause resistance to therapy. A number of aggressive malignancies, including melanoma, colon cancer, and glioma, are driven by a constitutively activating missense mutation (V600E) in the v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) component of the pathway. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition is initially effective in targeting these cancers, but reflexive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling contributes to frequent therapy resistance. We have previously demonstrated that combination treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the dual mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/2 inhibitor TAK228 improves survival and decreases vascularization in a BRAF(V600E) mutant glioma model. To elucidate the mechanism of action of this combination therapy and understand the ensuing tumor response, we performed comprehensive unbiased proteomic and phosphoproteomic characterization of BRAF(V600E) mutant glioma xenografts after short-course treatment with trametinib and TAK228. We identified 13,313 proteins and 30,928 localized phosphosites, of which 12,526 proteins and 17,444 phosphosites were quantified across all samples (data available via ProteomeXchange; identifier PXD022329). We identified distinct response signatures for each monotherapy and combination therapy and validated that combination treatment inhibited activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and mTOR pathways. Combination therapy also increased apoptotic signaling, suppressed angiogenesis signaling, and broadly suppressed the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinases. In response to combination therapy, both epidermal growth factor receptor and class 1 histone deacetylase proteins were activated. This study reports a detailed (phospho)proteomic analysis of the response of BRAF(V600E) mutant glioma to combined MEK and mTOR pathway inhibition and identifies new targets for the development of rational combination therapies for BRAF-driven tumors.
PXD025807	34298182	Proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolic functions and fertilization predominate in stallions with better motility. 	Stallion sperm proteins in 10 stallions with different motility	cryopreservation, horse, spermatozoa	Even in stallions with sperm quality within normal reference ranges at ejaculation, subtle differences in sperm quality exist that in many cases lead to reduced time frames for conservation of the ejaculate and/or reduced fertility. The spermatozoon is a cell highly suitable for proteomics studies, and the use of this technique is allowing rapid advances in the understanding of sperm biology. The aim of the present study was to investigate differences among stallions of variable sperm quality (based on motility and sperm velocities), although all horses had sperm characteristics within normal ranges. The proteome was studied using UHPLC/MS/MS and posterior bioinformatic and enrichment analysis; data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025807. Sperm motility, linear motility and circular, straight line and average velocities (VCL, VSL, VAP) were measured using computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA). In stallions showing better percentages of motility, circular and average velocity predominated mitochondrial proteins with roles in the Citric acid cycle, pyruvate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Interestingly, in stallions with better percentages of total motility, sperm proteins were also enriched in proteins within the gene ontology (G0) terms, single fertilization (G0: 0007338), fertilization (G0: 0009566), and zona pellucida receptor complex (GO:0002199). The enrichment of this proteins in samples with better percentages of total motility may offer a molecular explanation for the link between this parameter and fertility. SIGNIFICANCE: Proteomic analysis identified a high degree of specificity of stallion sperm proteins with discriminant power for motility, linear motility, and sperm velocities (VCL, VAP and VSL). These findings may represent an interesting outcome in relation to the molecular biology regulating the movement of the spermatozoa, and the biological meaning of the measurements that computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) provide. Of a total of 903 proteins identified in stallion spermatozoa, 24 were related to the percentage of total motility in the sample; interestingly, gene ontology (G0) analysis revealed that these proteins were enriched in terms like single fertilization and fertilization, providing a molecular link between motility and fertility. Field studies indicate that the percentage of total motility is the CASA derived parameter with the best correlation with fertility in stallions.
PXD016112	34298622	Therapeutic Cancer Vaccination with Immunopeptidomics-Discovered Antigens Confers Protective Antitumor Efficacy. 	Immunopeptidome analysis of 4T1 murine breast cancer cells.	4T1, MHC-I, Orbitrap Fusion, cancer, immunopeptidome, ligandome, murine	Knowledge of clinically targetable tumor antigens is becoming vital for broader design and utility of therapeutic cancer vaccines. This information is obtained reliably by directly interrogating the MHC-I presented peptide ligands, the immunopeptidome, with state-of-the-art mass spectrometry. Our manuscript describes direct identification of novel tumor antigens for an aggressive triple-negative breast cancer model. Immunopeptidome profiling revealed 2481 unique antigens, among them a novel ERV antigen originating from an endogenous retrovirus element. The clinical benefit and tumor control potential of the identified tumor antigens and ERV antigen were studied in a preclinical model using two vaccine platforms and therapeutic settings. Prominent control of established tumors was achieved using an oncolytic adenovirus platform designed for flexible and specific tumor targeting, namely PeptiCRAd. Our study presents a pipeline integrating immunopeptidome analysis-driven antigen discovery with a therapeutic cancer vaccine platform for improved personalized oncolytic immunotherapy.
PXD023592	34298646	Characterization of Novel Progression Factors in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Based on Global Comparative Proteome Analysis. 	CRPC biomarker via proteomic analysis	: comparative proteomics, Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), CRPC, Diabetes (B/D-HPP), FOXA1, Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Cancer (B/D-HPP), androgen deprivation therapy, prostate cancer	Identifying the biological change from hormone-naive prostate cancer to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a major clinical challenge for developing therapeutic agents. Although the pathways that lead to CRPC are not fully completely understood, recent evidence demonstrates that androgen signaling is often maintained through varied mechanisms. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is used as a primary treatment for preventing the progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Here we investigated PCa tissues at each stage of progression, from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) to CRPC, based on quantitative proteomic technology, including tissues after ADT. In total, 4768 proteins were identified in this study, of which 4069 were quantified in the combined PCa tissues. Among the quantified proteins, 865 were differentially expressed proteins (21.2%). Based on the quantitative protein results, we performed systematic bioinformatics analysis and found that the levels of 15 proteins, including FOXA1 and HMGN1-3, increased among T3G3, T3GX, and CRPC, despite the ADT. Among all targets, we verified the increased levels of FOXA1 and HMGN1-3 in CRPC by immunoblotting and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In summary, we discuss the changes in intracellular factors involved in the progression of CRPC PCa despite ADT. Moreover, we suggest that FOXA1 and HMGN1-3 proteins could be used as potential CRPC-related factors in clinical therapeutic agents.
PXD026027	34298739	Proteomics of Primary Uveal Melanoma: Insights into Metastasis and Protein Biomarkers. 	Proteomics of Primary Uveal Melanoma:Insights to Metastasis and Protein Biomarkers	bioinformatics, iTRAQ, immune profiling, metastasis, prediction modeling, quantitative proteomics, uveal melanoma	Uveal melanoma metastases are lethal and remain incurable. A quantitative proteomic analysis of 53 metastasizing and 47 non-metastasizing primary uveal melanoma (pUM) was pursued for insights into UM metastasis and protein biomarkers. The metastatic status of the pUM specimens was defined based on clinical data, survival histories, prognostic analyses, and liver histopathology. LC MS/MS iTRAQ technology, the Mascot search engine, and the UniProt human database were used to identify and quantify pUM proteins relative to the normal choroid excised from UM donor eyes. The determined proteomes of all 100 tumors were very similar, encompassing a total of 3935 pUM proteins. Proteins differentially expressed (DE) between metastasizing and non-metastasizing pUM (n = 402) were employed in bioinformatic analyses that predicted significant differences in the immune system between metastasizing and non-metastasizing pUM. The immune proteins (n = 778) identified in this study support the immune-suppressive nature and low abundance of immune checkpoint regulators in pUM, and suggest CDH1, HLA-DPA1, and several DE immune kinases and phosphatases as possible candidates for immune therapy checkpoint blockade. Prediction modeling identified 32 proteins capable of predicting metastasizing versus non-metastasizing pUM with 93% discriminatory accuracy, supporting the potential for protein-based prognostic methods for detecting UM metastasis.
PXD017738	34301255	Proteomic analysis revealed the roles of YRR1 deletion in enhancing the vanillin resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 	Proteomic analysis demonstrated transcription factor gene YRR1 deletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae enhances its resistance to vanillin through the upregulation of transcriptional activator Haa1, coactivator Mbf1, and proteasome assembly chaperone Tma17 e	Saccharomyces cerevisiae, YRR1, bioethanol, quantitative proteomics, vanillin resistance	BACKGROUND: Vanillin is one of the important phenolic inhibitors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for bioconversion of lignocellulosic materials and has been reported to inhibit the translation process in cells. In our previous studies, it was confirmed that the deletion of the transcription factor gene YRR1 enhanced vanillin resistance by promoting some translation-related processes at the transcription level. In this work, we investigated the effects of proteomic changes upon induction of vanillin stress and deletion of YRR1 to provide unique perspectives from a transcriptome analysis for comprehending the mechanisms of YRR1 deletion in the protective response of yeast to vanillin. RESULTS: In wild-type cells, vanillin reduced two dozens of ribosomal proteins contents while upregulated proteins involved in glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and the pentose phosphate pathway in cells. The ratios of NADPH/NADP(+) and NADH/NAD(+) were increased when cells responded to vanillin stress. The differentially expressed proteins perturbed by YRR1 deletion were much more abundant than and showed no overlaps with transcriptome changes, indicating that Yrr1 affects the synthesis of certain proteins. Forty-eight of 112 upregulated proteins were involved in the stress response, translational and transcriptional regulation. YRR1 deletion increased the expression of HAA1-encoding transcriptional activator, TMA17-encoding proteasome assembly chaperone and MBF1-encoding coactivator at the protein level, as confirmed by ELISA. Cultivation data showed that the overexpression of HAA1 and TMA17 enhanced resistance to vanillin in S. cerevisiae. CONCLUSIONS: Cells conserve energy by decreasing the content of ribosomal proteins, producing more energy and NAD(P)H for survival in response to vanillin stress. Yrr1 improved vanillin resistance by increasing the protein quantities of Haa1, Tma17 and Mbf1. These results showed the response of S. cerevisiae to vanillin and how YRR1 deletion increases vanillin resistance at the protein level. These findings may advance our knowledge of how YRR1 deletion protects yeast from vanillin stress and offer novel targets for genetic engineering of designing inhibitor-resistant ethanologenic yeast strains.
PXD025912	34301959	Deacetylation as a receptor-regulated direct activation switch for pannexin channels. 	Acetylation level of Pannexin 1 lysine residues following alpha 1 adrenoceptor activation	Pannexin, Panx1, SILAC, acetylation, alpha 1 adrenoceptor, phenylephrine	Activation of Pannexin 1 (PANX1) ion channels causes release of intercellular signaling molecules in a variety of (patho)physiological contexts. PANX1 can be activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including alpha1-adrenergic receptors (alpha1-ARs), but how receptor engagement leads to channel opening remains unclear. Here, we show that GPCR-mediated PANX1 activation can occur via channel deacetylation. We find that alpha1-AR-mediated activation of PANX1 channels requires Galphaq but is independent of phospholipase C or intracellular calcium. Instead, alpha1-AR-mediated PANX1 activation involves RhoA, mammalian diaphanous (mDia)-related formin, and a cytosolic lysine deacetylase activated by mDia - histone deacetylase 6. HDAC6 associates with PANX1 and activates PANX1 channels, even in excised membrane patches, suggesting direct deacetylation of PANX1. Substitution of basally-acetylated intracellular lysine residues identified on PANX1 by mass spectrometry either prevents HDAC6-mediated activation (K140/409Q) or renders the channels constitutively active (K140R). These data define a non-canonical RhoA-mDia-HDAC6 signaling pathway for GalphaqPCR activation of PANX1 channels and uncover lysine acetylation-deacetylation as an ion channel silencing-activation mechanism.
PXD020907	34302476	The RGG domain in the C-terminus of the DEAD box helicases Dbp2 and Ded1 is necessary for G-quadruplex destabilization. 	S. pombe LC-MS G4-binding proteins	G-quadruplex, LC-MC, Schizosaccharomyces pombe	The identification of G-quadruplex (G4) binding proteins and insights into their mechanism of action are important for understanding the regulatory functions of G4 structures. Here, we performed an unbiased affinity-purification assay coupled with mass spectrometry and identified 30 putative G4 binding proteins from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Gene ontology analysis of the molecular functions enriched in this pull-down assay included mRNA binding, RNA helicase activity, and translation regulator activity. We focused this study on three of the identified proteins that possessed putative arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) domains, namely the Stm1 homolog Oga1 and the DEAD box RNA helicases Dbp2 and Ded1. We found that Oga1, Dbp2, and Ded1 bound to both DNA and RNA G4s in vitro. Both Dbp2 and Ded1 bound to G4 structures through the RGG domain located in the C-terminal region of the helicases, and point mutations in this domain weakened the G4 binding properties of the helicases. Dbp2 and Ded1 destabilized less thermostable G4 RNA and DNA structures, and this ability was independent of ATP but dependent on the RGG domain. Our study provides the first evidence that the RGG motifs in DEAD box helicases are necessary for both G4 binding and G4 destabilization.
PXD023202	34303857	The Choice of Search Engine Affects Sequencing Depth and HLA Class I Allele-Specific Peptide Repertoires. 	The choice of search engine for interpretation of immunopeptidomics datasets affects the sequencing depth and the extent of detected HLA allele-specific peptide repertoires	Immunopeptidomics, Search Engine	Standardization of immunopeptidomics experiments across laboratories is a pressing issue within the field, and currently a variety of different methods for sample preparation and data analysis tools are applied. Here, we compared different software packages to interrogate immunopeptidomics datasets and found that Peaks reproducibly reports substantially more peptide sequences (~30-70%) compared with Maxquant, Comet, and MS-GF+ at a global false discovery rate (FDR) of <1%. We noted that these differences are driven by search space and spectral ranking. Furthermore, we observed differences in the proportion of peptides binding the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles present in the samples, indicating that sequence-related differences affected the performance of each tested engine. Utilizing data from single HLA allele expressing cell lines, we observed significant differences in amino acid frequency among the peptides reported, with a broadly higher representation of hydrophobic amino acids L, I, P, and V reported by Peaks. We validated these results using data generated with a synthetic library of 2000 HLA-associated peptides from four common HLA alleles with distinct anchor residues. Our investigation highlights that search engines create a bias in peptide sequence depth and peptide amino acid composition, and resulting data should be interpreted with caution.

In recent years, sleep disorders have been linked to many diseases and human body disorders, including cancer. Some experimental studies in mice found that sleep fragmentation could promote tumor development and progression. However, effects on GL-pp on tumor metastasis under circumstances of sleep disorders have rarely been studied. Thus, in this study, we used mice with sleep fragmentation (SF) bearing B16-F10-luc-G5 melanoma tumors to investigate the effect of SF on melanoma metastasis. Furthermore, we investigated the antitumor and antimetastatic effects of GL-pp (80 mg/kg) in mice suffering from SF and bearing B16-F10-luc-G5. Then, whole proteomics was used to analyze the differences in protein expression in the lung tissue between SF mice bearing B16-F10-luc-G5 with and without GL-pp administration. High-throughput pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA was also used to analyze the impact of GL-pp on the gut microbiota composition in SF mice bearing B16-F10-luc-G5. Last, the effects of GL-pp on macrophage polarization and TNF-alpha serum levels were detected. Collectively, we found that SF significantly facilitated the B16-F10-luc-G5 melanoma tumor metastasis in mice, while GL-pp significantly reduced B16-F10-luc-G5 melanoma tumor metastasis under the condition of SF, in which proteomics and gut microbiota had been changed greatly.
PXD024871	34305947	Immunopeptidomics-Guided Warehouse Design for Peptide-Based Immunotherapy in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. 	Immunopeptidomics-guided warehouse design for peptide-based immunotherapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia	CLL, HLA, immunopeptidome, peptide warehouse	Antigen-specific immunotherapies, in particular peptide vaccines, depend on the recognition of naturally presented antigens derived from mutated and unmutated gene products on human leukocyte antigens, and represent a promising low-side-effect concept for cancer treatment. So far, the broad application of peptide vaccines in cancer patients is hampered by challenges of time- and cost-intensive personalized vaccine design, and the lack of neoepitopes from tumor-specific mutations, especially in low-mutational burden malignancies. In this study, we developed an immunopeptidome-guided workflow for the design of tumor-associated off-the-shelf peptide warehouses for broadly applicable personalized therapeutics. Comparative mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidome analyses of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples, as representative example of low-mutational burden tumor entities, and a dataset of benign tissue samples enabled the identification of high-frequent non-mutated CLL-associated antigens. These antigens were further shown to be recognized by pre-existing and de novo induced T cells in CLL patients and healthy volunteers, and were evaluated as pre-manufactured warehouse for the construction of personalized multi-peptide vaccines in a first clinical trial for CLL (NCT04688385). This workflow for the design of peptide warehouses is easily transferable to other tumor entities and can provide the foundation for the development of broad personalized T cell-based immunotherapy approaches.

Cavbeta is a cytosolic protein that regulates channel trafficking and activity, but it also exerts other LTCC-independent functions. Cardiac hypertrophy, a relevant risk factor for the development of congestive heart failure, depends on the activation of calcium-dependent pro-hypertrophic signaling cascades. Here, by using shRNA-mediated Cavbeta silencing, we demonstrate that Cavbeta2 downregulation enhances alpha1-adrenergic receptor agonist-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We report that a pool of Cavbeta2 is targeted to the nucleus in cardiomyocytes and that the expression of this nuclear fraction decreases during in vitro and in vivo induction of cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, the overexpression of nucleus-targeted Cavbeta2 in cardiomyocytes inhibits in vitro-induced hypertrophy. Quantitative proteomic analyses showed that Cavbeta2 knockdown leads to changes in the expression of diverse myocyte proteins, including reduction of calpastatin, an endogenous inhibitor of the calcium-dependent protease calpain. Accordingly, Cavbeta2-downregulated cardiomyocytes had a 2-fold increase in calpain activity as compared to control cells. Furthermore, inhibition of calpain activity in Cavbeta2-downregulated cells abolished the enhanced alpha1-adrenergic receptor agonist-induced hypertrophy observed in these cells. Our findings indicate that in cardiomyocytes, a nuclear pool of Cavbeta2 participates in cellular functions that are independent of LTCC activity. They also indicate that a downregulation of nuclear Cavbeta2 during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy promotes the activation of calpain-dependent hypertrophic pathways.
PXD019998	34309874	Deletion of mTOR in liver epithelial cells enhances hepatic metastasis of colon cancer. 	Deletion of mTOR in liver epithelial cells enhances hepatic metastasis of colon cancer	NF-Ä¸B signaling, liver metastasis, mTOR	Activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is frequently found in cancer, but mTOR inhibitors have thus far failed to demonstrate significant antiproliferative efficacy in the majority of cancer types. Besides cancer cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms, it is conceivable that mTOR inhibitors impact on non-malignant host cells in a manner that ultimately supports resistance of cancer cells. Against this background, we sought to analyze the functional consequences of mTOR inhibition in hepatocytes for the growth of metastatic colon cancer. To this end, we established liver epithelial cell (LEC)-specific knockout (KO) of mTOR (mTOR(LEC) ) mice. We used these mice to characterize the growth of colorectal liver metastases with or without partial hepatectomy to model different clinical settings. Although the LEC-specific loss of mTOR remained without effect on metastasis growth in intact liver, partial liver resection resulted in the formation of larger metastases in mTOR(LEC) mice compared with wildtype controls. This was accompanied by significantly enhanced inflammatory activity in LEC-specific mTOR KO livers after partial liver resection. Analysis of NF-kB target gene expression and immunohistochemistry of p65 displayed a significant activation of NF-kB in mTOR(LEC) mice, suggesting a functional importance of this pathway for the observed inflammatory phenotype. Taken together, we show an unexpected acceleration of liver metastases upon deletion of mTOR in LECs. Our results support the notion that non-malignant host cells can contribute to resistance against mTOR inhibitors and encourage testing whether anti-inflammatory drugs are able to improve the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors for cancer therapy.

PXD022571	34310849	Inhibition of NAE-dependent protein hyper-NEDDylation in cystic cholangiocytes halts cystogenesis in experimental models of polycystic liver disease. 	Pevonedistat inhibits aberrant protein NEDDylation in Polycystic Liver Diseases.	Hepatic cystogenesis, MLN4924, NAE1., NEDDylation, Pevonedistat, Therapy	BACKGROUND: Polycystic liver diseases (PLDs) are genetic inherited disorders characterized by the progressive growth of numerous intrahepatic biliary cysts, which are the main cause of morbidity. Previous studies revealed that cystic cholangiocytes are characterized by endoplasmic reticulum stress and aberrant posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins, in particular hyper-SUMOylation, that promote PLD pathobiology. Protein NEDDylation is a newly characterized PTM that modulates a plethora of biological processes and its dysregulation is associated with the development and progression of several human diseases. However, the role of NEDDylation in PLD remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of protein NEDDylation in PLD and its potential therapeutic regulatory value. METHODS: Levels and functional effects of NEDDylation, including response to Pevonedistat (first-in-class selective inhibitor of the NEDDylation E1 enzyme NAE), were assessed in vitro, in vivo, and/or in patients with PLD. NEDDylated protein levels in normal and cystic human cholangiocytes were assessed by immunoprecipitation, and the proteomic profile was further analyzed by mass spectrometry. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The genes involved in the NEDDylation pathway were found overexpressed (mRNA) in polycystic human and rat liver tissue, as well as in cystic cholangiocytes in culture, compared to controls. Elevated levels of NEDDylated proteins were further confirmed in cystic cholangiocytes in vitro, which diminished under Pevonedistat incubation. Pevonedistat promoted apoptotic cell death and reduced proliferation in cystic cholangiocytes in vitro. Comparative proteomic profiling of NEDD8-immunoprecipitated proteins between normal and cystic cholangiocytes in culture reported candidate proteins involved in cystogenesis, mostly associated with protein biogenesis and quality control. All these data indicate that cystic cholangiocytes display increased protein NEDDylation, contributing to cell survival and proliferation, ultimately supporting hepatic cystogenesis. Targeting of protein hyper-NEDDylation in cystic cholangiocytes inhibits cystogenesis in experimental models, representing a novel therapeutic opportunity in PLD.
PXD024372	34312234	Multicomponent nature underlies the extraordinary mechanical properties of spider dragline silk. 	Orb-weaver spider (Trichonephila inaurata madagascariensis) dragline silk proteome	Dragline silk, Orb-weaver spider, Spider, Trichonephila inaurata madagascariensis	Dragline silk of golden orb-weaver spiders (Nephilinae) is noted for its unsurpassed toughness, combining extraordinary extensibility and tensile strength, suggesting industrial application as a sustainable biopolymer material. To pinpoint the molecular composition of dragline silk and the roles of its constituents in achieving its mechanical properties, we report a multiomics approach, combining high-quality genome sequencing and assembly, silk gland transcriptomics, and dragline silk proteomics of four Nephilinae spiders. We observed the consistent presence of the MaSp3B spidroin unique to this subfamily as well as several nonspidroin SpiCE proteins. Artificial synthesis and the combination of these components in vitro showed that the multicomponent nature of dragline silk, including MaSp3B and SpiCE, along with MaSp1 and MaSp2, is essential to realize the mechanical properties of spider dragline silk.
PXD026104	34312306	Heterogeneous Expression of Nuclear Encoded Mitochondrial Genes Distinguishes Inhibitory and Excitatory Neurons. 	Heterogeneous Expression of Nuclear Encoded Mitochondrial Genes Distinguishes Inhibitory and Excitatory Neurons.	Mitochondria, Neurons, TMT	Mitochondrial composition varies by organ and their constituent cell types. This mitochondrial diversity likely determines variations in mitochondrial function. However, the heterogeneity of mitochondria in the brain remains underexplored despite the large diversity of cell types in neuronal tissue. Here, we used molecular systems biology tools to address whether mitochondrial composition varies by brain region and neuronal cell type in mice. We reasoned that proteomics and transcriptomics of microdissected brain regions combined with analysis of single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNAseq) could reveal the extent of mitochondrial compositional diversity. We selected nuclear encoded gene products forming complexes of fixed stoichiometry, such as the respiratory chain complexes and the mitochondrial ribosome, as well as molecules likely to perform their function as monomers, such as the family of SLC25 transporters. We found that the proteome encompassing these nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and obtained from microdissected brain tissue segregated the hippocampus, striatum, and cortex from each other. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts could only segregate cell types and brain regions when the analysis was performed at the single-cell level. In fact, single-cell mitochondrial transcriptomes were able to distinguish glutamatergic and distinct types of GABAergic neurons from one another. Within these cell categories, unique SLC25A transporters were able to identify distinct cell subpopulations. Our results demonstrate heterogeneous mitochondrial composition across brain regions and cell types. We postulate that mitochondrial heterogeneity influences regional and cell type-specific mechanisms in health and disease.
PXD023938	34312428	Proteomics reveals disturbances in the immune response and energy metabolism of monocytes from patients with septic shock. 	Proteomic analysis of human sepsis monocytes	Sepsis, Septic shock, blood, infection, monocyte	Sepsis results from a dyshomeostatic response to infection, which may lead to hyper or hypoimmune states. Monocytes are central regulators of the inflammatory response, but our understanding of their role in the genesis and resolution of sepsis is still limited. Here, we report a comprehensive exploration of monocyte molecular responses in a cohort of patients with septic shock via proteomic profiling. The acute stage of septic shock was associated with an impaired inflammatory phenotype, indicated by the down-regulation of MHC class II molecules and proinflammatory cytokine pathways. Simultaneously, there was an up-regulation of glycolysis enzymes and a decrease in proteins related to the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. On the other hand, the restoration of immunocompetence was the hallmark of recovering patients, in which an upregulation of interferon signaling pathways was a notable feature. Our results provide insights into the immunopathology of sepsis and propose that, pending future studies, immunometabolism pathway components could serve as therapeutic targets in septic patients.
PXD025097	34312990	DDASSQ: An open-source, multiple peptide sequencing strategy for label free quantification based on an OpenMS pipeline in the KNIME analytics platform. 	Mouse liver proteome fractionation using leptin-based cartridges.	LC-MS, fractionation, glycoproteins, liver	In this study we investigated the performance of a computational pipeline for protein identification and label free quantification (LFQ) of LC-MS/MS data sets from experimental animal tissue samples, as well as the impact of its specific peptide search combinatorial approach. The full pipeline workflow was composed of peptide search engine adapters based on different identification algorithms, in the frame of the open-source OpenMS software running within the KNIME analytics platform. Two different in silico tryptic digestion, database-search assisted approaches (X!Tandem and MS-GF+), de novo peptide sequencing based on Novor and consensus library search (SpectraST), were tested for the processing of LC-MS/MS raw data files obtained from proteomic LC-MS experiments done on proteolytic extracts from mouse ex vivo liver samples. The results from proteomic LFQ were compared to those based on the application of the two software tools MaxQuant and Proteome Discoverer for protein inference and label-free data analysis in shotgun proteomics. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025097.
PXD025474	34313222	In vivo analysis reveals that ATP-hydrolysis couples remodeling to SWI/SNF release from chromatin. 	In vivo Analysis Reveals that ATP-hydrolysis Couples Remodeling  to SWI/SNF Release from Chromatin.	ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, Brahma, Ecdysone  receptor, Polytene chromosomes, SWI/SNF, live-cell imaging	ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers control the accessibility of genomic DNA through nucleosome mobilization. However, the dynamics of genome exploration by remodelers, and the role of ATP hydrolysis in this process remain unclear. We used live-cell imaging of Drosophila polytene nuclei to monitor Brahma (BRM) remodeler interactions with its chromosomal targets. In parallel, we measured local chromatin condensation and its effect on BRM association. Surprisingly, only a small portion of BRM is bound to chromatin at any given time. BRM binds decondensed chromatin but is excluded from condensed chromatin, limiting its genomic search space. BRM-chromatin interactions are highly dynamic, whereas histone-exchange is limited and much slower. Intriguingly, loss of ATP hydrolysis enhanced chromatin retention and clustering of BRM, which was associated with reduced histone turnover. Thus, ATP hydrolysis couples nucleosome remodeling to remodeler release, driving a continuous transient probing of the genome.
PXD023787	34314090	Quorum sensing governs a transmissive Legionella subpopulation at the pathogen vacuole periphery. 	Quorum sensing mediates the emergence of peripheral transmissive Legionella within the pathogen vacuole, selective escape and efficient spread	LC-MS, Label-free quantification, Legionella	The Gram-negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease and replicates in amoebae and macrophages within a distinct compartment, the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV). The facultative intracellular pathogen switches between a replicative, non-virulent and a non-replicating, virulent/transmissive phase. Here, we show on a single-cell level that at late stages of infection, individual motile (PflaA -GFP-positive) and virulent (PralF - and PsidC -GFP-positive) L. pneumophila emerge in the cluster of non-growing bacteria within an LCV. Comparative proteomics of PflaA -GFP-positive and PflaA -GFP-negative L. pneumophila subpopulations reveals distinct proteomes with flagellar proteins or cell division proteins being preferentially produced by the former or the latter, respectively. Toward the end of an infection cycle (~ 48 h), the PflaA -GFP-positive L. pneumophila subpopulation emerges at the cluster periphery, predominantly escapes the LCV, and spreads from the bursting host cell. These processes are mediated by the Legionella quorum sensing (Lqs) system. Thus, quorum sensing regulates the emergence of a subpopulation of transmissive L. pneumophila at the LCV periphery, and phenotypic heterogeneity underlies the intravacuolar bi-phasic life cycle of L. pneumophila.
PXD026731	34314685	Diverse mitochondrial abnormalities in a new cellular model of TAFFAZZIN deficiency are remediated by cardiolipin-interacting small molecules. 	Diverse mitochondrial abnormalities in a new cellular model of TAFFAZZIN deficiency are remediated by Cardiolipin-interacting small molecules	Barth Syndrome, Cardiolipin	Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked disorder of mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism caused by pathogenic variants in TAFFAZIN, which results in abnormal cardiolipin (CL) content in the inner mitochondrial membrane. To identify unappreciated pathways of mitochondrial dysfunction in BTHS, we utilized an unbiased proteomics strategy and identified that complex I (CI) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the mitochondrial quality control protease presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein (PARL) are altered in a new HEK293-based tafazzin-deficiency model. Follow-up studies confirmed decreased steady state levels of specific CI subunits and an assembly factor in the absence of tafazzin; this decrease is in part based on decreased transcription and results in reduced CI assembly and function. PARL, a rhomboid protease associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane with a role in the mitochondrial response to stress, such as mitochondrial membrane depolarization, is increased in tafazzin-deficient cells. The increased abundance of PARL correlates with augmented processing of a downstream target, phosphoglycerate mutase 5, at baseline and in response to mitochondrial depolarization. To clarify the relationship between abnormal CL content, CI levels, and increased PARL expression that occurs when tafazzin is missing, we used blue-native PAGE and gene expression analysis to determine that these defects are remediated by SS-31 and bromoenol lactone, pharmacologic agents that bind CL or inhibit CL deacylation, respectively. These findings have the potential to enhance our understanding of the cardiac pathology of BTHS, where defective mitochondrial quality control and CI dysfunction have well-recognized roles in the pathology of diverse forms of cardiac dysfunction.
PXD023583	34314730	Chemo-proteomics exploration of HDAC degradability by small molecule degraders. 	Chemo-proteomics exploration of HDAC degradability by small molecule degraders	E3 ligase, HDAC, IMiD, PROTAC, degrader, targeted degradation, ubiquitin	Targeted protein degradation refers to the use of small molecules that recruit a ubiquitin ligase to a target protein for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. While degraders have been developed for many targets, key questions regarding degrader development and the consequences of acute pharmacological degradation remain, specifically for targets that exist in obligate multi-protein complexes. Here, we synthesize a pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) degrader library for the chemo-proteomic exploration of acute degradation of a key class of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Using chemo-proteomics, we not only map the degradability of the zinc-dependent HDAC family identifying leads for targeting HDACs 1-8 and 10 but also explore important aspects of degrading epigenetic enzymes. We discover cell line-driven target specificity and that HDAC degradation often results in collateral loss of HDAC-containing repressive complexes. These findings potentially offer a new mechanism toward controlling chromatin structure, and our resource will facilitate accelerated degrader design and development for HDACs.
PXD024745	34315505	Spatial epi-proteomics enabled by histone post-translational modification analysis from low-abundance clinical samples. 	Comparison of in-gel digestion methods for histone PTM analysis	ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, epigenetics, histone post-translationa modification	BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence linking epigenetic mechanisms and different diseases, including cancer, has prompted in the last 15 years the investigation of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) in clinical samples. Methods allowing the isolation of histones from patient samples followed by the accurate and comprehensive quantification of their PTMs by mass spectrometry (MS) have been developed. However, the applicability of these methods is limited by the requirement for substantial amounts of material. RESULTS: To address this issue, in this study we streamlined the protein extraction procedure from low-amount clinical samples and tested and implemented different in-gel digestion strategies, obtaining a protocol that allows the MS-based analysis of the most common histone PTMs from laser microdissected tissue areas containing as low as 1000 cells, an amount approximately 500 times lower than what is required by available methods. We then applied this protocol to breast cancer patient laser microdissected tissues in two proof-of-concept experiments, identifying differences in histone marks in heterogeneous regions selected by either morphological evaluation or MALDI MS imaging. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that analyzing histone PTMs from very small tissue areas and detecting differences from adjacent tumor regions is technically feasible. Our method opens the way for spatial epi-proteomics, namely the investigation of epigenetic features in the context of tissue and tumor heterogeneity, which will be instrumental for the identification of novel epigenetic biomarkers and aberrant epigenetic mechanisms.
PXD023752	34315806	Short stature and combined immunodeficiency associated with mutations in RGS10. 	RGS10L phosphorylation site determination Top-Down	RGS10L, Top-Down, phoshorylation	We report the clinical and molecular phenotype of three siblings from one family, who presented with short stature and immunodeficiency and carried uncharacterized variants in RGS10 (c.489_491del:p.E163del and c.G511T:p.A171S). This gene encodes regulator of G protein signaling 10 (RGS10), a member of a large family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that targets heterotrimeric G proteins to constrain the activity of G protein-coupled receptors, including receptors for chemoattractants. The affected individuals exhibited systemic abnormalities directly related to the RGS10 mutations, including recurrent infections, hypergammaglobulinemia, profoundly reduced lymphocyte chemotaxis, abnormal lymph node architecture, and short stature due to growth hormone deficiency. Although the GAP activity of each RGS10 variant was intact, each protein exhibited aberrant patterns of PKA-mediated phosphorylation and increased cytosolic and cell membrane localization and activity compared to the wild-type protein. We propose that the RGS10 p.E163del and p.A171S mutations lead to mislocalization of the RGS10 protein in the cytosol, thereby resulting in attenuated chemokine signaling. This study suggests that RGS10 is critical for both immune competence and normal hormonal metabolism in humans and that rare RGS10 variants may contribute to distinct systemic genetic disorders.
PXD020440	34315882	Insulin signaling regulates longevity through protein phosphorylation in Caenorhabditis elegans. 	Insulin Signaling Regulates Longevity Through Protein Phosphorylation in Caenorhabditis elegans	Caenorhabditis elegans, SRM, functional phosphosites, insulin/IGF-1 signaling, metabolic labeling, phosphoproteomics, quantitative proteomics	Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling (IIS) is known to constrain longevity by inhibiting the transcription factor FOXO. How phosphorylation mediated by IIS kinases regulates lifespan beyond FOXO remains unclear. Here, we profile IIS-dependent phosphorylation changes in a large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of wild-type and three IIS mutant Caenorhabditis elegans strains. We quantify more than 15,000 phosphosites and find that 476 of these are differentially phosphorylated in the long-lived daf-2/insulin receptor mutant. We develop a machine learning-based method to prioritize 25 potential lifespan-related phosphosites. We perform validations to show that AKT-1 pT492 inhibits DAF-16/FOXO and compensates the loss of daf-2 function, that EIF-2alpha pS49 potently inhibits protein synthesis and daf-2 longevity, and that reduced phosphorylation of multiple germline proteins apparently transmits reduced DAF-2 signaling to the soma. In addition, an analysis of kinases with enriched substrates detects that casein kinase 2 (CK2) subunits negatively regulate lifespan. Our study reveals detailed functional insights into longevity.
PXD024674	34315889	The trans-omics landscape of COVID-19. 	The Trans-omics Landscape of COVID-19	COVID-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19	The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. Various omics results have been reported for COVID-19, but the molecular hallmarks of COVID-19, especially in those patients without comorbidities, have not been fully investigated. Here we collect blood samples from 231 COVID-19 patients, prefiltered to exclude those with selected comorbidities, yet with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to critically ill. Using integrative analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and lipidomic profiles, we report a trans-omics landscape for COVID-19. Our analyses find neutrophils heterogeneity between asymptomatic and critically ill patients. Meanwhile, neutrophils over-activation, arginine depletion and tryptophan metabolites accumulation correlate with T cell dysfunction in critical patients. Our multi-omics data and characterization of peripheral blood from COVID-19 patients may thus help provide clues regarding pathophysiology of and potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.
PXD026804	34315891	Transporter characterisation reveals aminoethylphosphonate mineralisation as a key step in the marine phosphorus redox cycle. 	Transporter characterisation reveals aminoethylphosphonate mineralisation as a key step in the marine phosphorus redox cycle	LCMSMS, Transporter, Warwick-RTP, phosphorus redox cycle	The planktonic synthesis of reduced organophosphorus molecules, such as alkylphosphonates and aminophosphonates, represents one half of a vast global oceanic phosphorus redox cycle. Whilst alkylphosphonates tend to accumulate in recalcitrant dissolved organic matter, aminophosphonates do not. Here, we identify three bacterial 2-aminoethylphosphonate (2AEP) transporters, named AepXVW, AepP and AepSTU, whose synthesis is independent of phosphate concentrations (phosphate-insensitive). AepXVW is found in diverse marine heterotrophs and is ubiquitously distributed in mesopelagic and epipelagic waters. Unlike the archetypal phosphonate binding protein, PhnD, AepX has high affinity and high specificity for 2AEP (Stappia stellulata AepX Kd 23 +/- 4 nM; methylphosphonate Kd 3.4 +/- 0.3 mM). In the global ocean, aepX is heavily transcribed (~100-fold>phnD) independently of phosphate and nitrogen concentrations. Collectively, our data identifies a mechanism responsible for a major oxidation process in the marine phosphorus redox cycle and suggests 2AEP may be an important source of regenerated phosphate and ammonium, which are required for oceanic primary production.
PXD018982	34316033	Cytokine-enhanced cytolytic activity of exosomes from NK Cells. 	Cytokine-enhanced cytolytic activity of Exosomes from NK Cells	Cytokine, Exosome, NK Cells	Natural killer (NK) cells play key roles in immune surveillance against tumors and viral infection. NK cells distinguish abnormal cells from healthy cells by cell-cell interaction with cell surface proteins and then attack target cells via multiple mechanisms. In addition, extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from NK cells (NK-EVs), including exosomes, possess cytotoxic capacity against tumor cells, but their characteristics and regulation by cytokines remain unknown. Here, we report that EVs derived from human NK-92 cells stimulated with IL-15 + IL-21 show enhanced cytotoxic capacity against tumor cells. Major cytolytic granules, granzyme B and granzyme H, are enriched by IL-15 + IL-21 stimulation in NK-EVs; however, knockout experiments reveal those cytolytic granules are independent of enhanced cytotoxic capacity. To find out the key molecules, mass spectrometry analyses were performed with different cytokine conditions, no cytokine, IL-15, IL-21, or IL-15 + IL-21. We then found that CD226 (DNAM-1) on NK-EVs is enriched by IL-15 + IL-21 stimulation and that blocking antibodies against CD226 reduced the cytolytic activity of NK-EVs. We also show NK-EVs are taken up by target cells via macropinocytosis. Collectively, our findings elucidate the novel properties of NK-EVs and the mechanism of their incorporation into target cells.
PXD022057	34316702	Elucidation of the BMI1 interactome identifies novel regulatory roles in glioblastoma. 	Elucidation of BMI1, RYBP and H2AK119ub interactomes in Glioblastoma	BMI1, ChIPMS, GBM, Glioblastoma, H2AK119ub, IPMS, RYBP	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive intrinsic brain tumour in adults. Epigenetic mechanisms controlling normal brain development are often dysregulated in GBM. Among these, BMI1, a structural component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which promotes the H2AK119ub catalytic activity of Ring1B, is upregulated in GBM and its tumorigenic role has been shown in vitro and in vivo. Here, we have used protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to elucidate the protein composition of PRC1 in GBM and transcriptional silencing of defining interactors in primary patient-derived GIC lines to assess their functional impact on GBM biology. We identify novel regulatory functions in mRNA splicing and cholesterol transport which could represent novel targetable mechanisms in GBM.
PXD022333	34316707	A novel class of inhibitors that target SRSF10 and promote p53-mediated cytotoxicity on human colorectal cancer cells. 	A novel class of CLK kinases inhibitors that target SRSF10 and promote p53mediated cytotoxicity on human colorectal cancer cells	CLK Kinases inhibitor, SRSF10, human colorectal cancer cells	The elevated expression of the splicing regulator SRSF10 in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) stimulates the production of the pro-tumorigenic BCLAF1-L splice variant. We discovered a group of small molecules with an aminothiazole carboxamide core (GPS167, GPS192 and others) that decrease production of BCLAF1-L. While additional alternative splicing events regulated by SRSF10 are affected by GPS167/192 in HCT116 cells (e.g. in MDM4, WTAP, SLK1 and CLK1), other events are shifted in a SRSF10-independent manner (e.g. in MDM2, NAB2 and TRA2A). GPS167/192 increased the interaction of SRSF10 with the CLK1 and CLK4 kinases, leading us to show that GPS167/192 can inhibit CLK kinases preferentially impacting the activity of SRSF10. Notably, GPS167 impairs the growth of CRC cell lines and organoids, inhibits anchorage-independent colony formation, cell migration, and promotes cytoxicity in a manner that requires SRSF10 and p53. In contrast, GPS167 only minimally affects normal colonocytes and normal colorectal organoids. Thus, GPS167 reprograms the tumorigenic activity of SRSF10 in CRC cells to elicit p53-dependent apoptosis.
PXD025048	34318855	Analysis of pancreatic extracellular matrix protein post-translational modifications via electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. 	Analysis of Pancreatic Extracellular Matrix Protein Post-Translational Modifications via Electrostatic Repulsion-Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography Coupled with Mass Spectrometry	electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC), extracellular matrix, glycopeptide, pancreas, phosphopeptide, post-translational modifications (PTM)	The pancreas is a vital organ with digestive and endocrine roles, and diseases of the pancreas affect millions of people yearly. A better understanding of the pancreas proteome and its dynamic post-translational modifications (PTMs) is necessary to engineer higher fidelity tissue analogues for use in transplantation. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has major roles in binding and signaling essential to the viability of insulin-producing islets of Langerhans. To characterize PTMs in the pancreas, native and decellularized tissues from four donors were analyzed. N-Glycosylated and phosphorylated peptides were simultaneously enriched via electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography and analyzed with mass spectrometry, maximizing PTM information from one workflow. A modified surfactant and chaotropic agent assisted sequential extraction/on-pellet digestion was used to maximize solubility of the ECM. The analysis resulted in the confident identification of 3650 proteins, including 517 N-glycoproteins and 148 phosphoproteins. We identified 214 ECM proteins, of which 99 were N-glycosylated, 18 were phosphorylated, and 9 were found to have both modifications. Collagens, a major component of the ECM, were the most highly glycosylated of the ECM proteins and several were also heavily phosphorylated, raising the possibility of structural and thus functional changes resulting from these modifications. To our knowledge, this work represents the first characterization of PTMs in pancreatic ECM proteins. This work provides a basal profile of PTMs in the healthy human pancreatic ECM, laying the foundation for future investigations to determine disease-specific changes such as in diabetes and pancreatic cancer, and potentially helping to guide the development of tissue replacement constructs. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025048.
PXD023334	34319745	Comparison of Unit Resolution Versus High-Resolution Accurate Mass for Parallel Reaction Monitoring. 	Comparison of unit resolution versus high-resolution accurate mass for parallel reaction monitoring	PRM, limit of quantitation, precision	Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) is an increasingly popular alternative to selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for targeted proteomics. PRM's strengths over SRM are that it monitors all product ions in a single spectrum, thus eliminating the need to select interference-free product ions prior to data acquisition, and that it is most frequently performed on high-resolution instruments, such as quadrupole-orbitrap and quadrupole-time-of-flight instruments. Here, we show that the primary advantage of PRM is the ability to monitor all transitions in parallel and that high-resolution data are not necessary to obtain high-quality quantitative data. We run the same scheduled PRM assay, measuring 432 peptides from 126 plasma proteins, multiple times on an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer, alternating separate liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry runs between the high-resolution Orbitrap and the unit resolution linear ion trap for PRM. We find that both mass analyzers have similar technical precision and that the linear ion trap's superior sensitivity gives it better lower limits of quantitation for over 62% of peptides in the assay.
PXD024650	34319750	Highly Multiplexed Kinase Profiling in Spleen with Targeted Mass Spectrometry Reveals Kinome Plasticity across Species. 	Highly multiplexed kinase profiling in spleen with targeted mass spectrometry reveals kinome plasticity across species	Kinase, preclinical species, spleen	Early attrition of drug candidates, including kinase inhibitors, often occurs due to issues that arise during preclinical safety and efficacy evaluation. This problem may be exacerbated by the fact that these studies might fail to consider the basic physiological differences that could exist between human patients and animal models. We report the development of a targeted mass spectrometry-based assay capable of monitoring >50 different kinases using peptides conserved in humans and the key preclinical species used in drug development (mouse, rat, dog, and cynomolgus monkey). These methods were then used to profile interspecies kinome variability in spleen with three of the current techniques used in targeted proteomics (MRM, PRM, and IS-PRM). IS-PRM provides the highest number of kinase identifications, and the results indicate that while this initial set of kinases exhibits high correlation between species for this tissue type, distinct species-specific differences do exist, especially within the cyclin-dependent kinase family. An initial screen in two species with the kinase inhibitor dasatinib in competition with the chemoproteomic kinase-binding probe XO44 demonstrated how the targeted methods can be further applied to study species-specific inhibitor occupancy profiles. Understanding such differences could help rationalize the findings of preclinical studies and have major implications for the selection of these animals as models in kinase drug development.
PXD025671	34319755	Toward Comprehensive Plasma Proteomics by Orthogonal Protease Digestion. 	Towards comprehensive plasma proteomics by orthogonal protease digestion	Clinical proteomics, DIA-MS, TB	Rapid and consistent protein identification across large clinical cohorts is an important goal for clinical proteomics. With the development of data-independent technologies (DIA/SWATH-MS), it is now possible to analyze hundreds of samples with great reproducibility and quantitative accuracy. However, this technology benefits from empirically derived spectral libraries that define the detectable set of peptides and proteins. Here, we apply a simple and accessible tip-based workflow for the generation of spectral libraries to provide a comprehensive overview on the plasma proteome in individuals with and without active tuberculosis (TB). To boost protein coverage, we utilized nonconventional proteases such as GluC and AspN together with the gold standard trypsin, identifying more than 30,000 peptides mapping to 3309 proteins. Application of this library to quantify plasma proteome differences in TB infection recovered more than 400 proteins in 50 min of MS acquisition, including diagnostic Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins that have previously been detectable primarily by antibody-based assays and intracellular proteins not previously described to be in plasma.
PXD023148	34320313	Evaluation of Spin Columns for Human Plasma Depletion to Facilitate MS-Based Proteomics Analysis of Plasma. 	iEvaluation of spin columns for human plasma depletion to facilitate MS-based proteomics analysis of SARS-cov-2 positive plasman columns for human plasma depletion to facilitate MS-based proteomics analysis of SARS-cov-2 positive plasma	SARS-cov-2, depletion, plasma, spin-column	High abundant protein depletion is a common strategy applied to increase analytical depth in global plasma proteomics experiment setups. The standard strategies for depletion of the highest abundant proteins currently rely on multiple-use HPLC columns or multiple-use spin columns. Here we evaluate the performance of single-use spin columns for plasma depletion and show that the single-use spin reduces handling time by allowing parallelization and is easily adapted to a nonspecialized lab environment without reducing the high plasma proteome coverage and reproducibility. In addition, we evaluate the effect of viral heat inactivation on the plasma proteome, an additional step in the plasma preparation workflow that allows the sample preparation of SARS-Cov2-infected samples to be performed in a BSL3 laboratory, and report the advantage of performing the heat inactivation postdepletion. We further show the possibility of expanding the use of the depletion column cross-species to macaque plasma samples. In conclusion, we report that single-use spin columns for high abundant protein depletion meet the requirements for reproducibly in in-depth plasma proteomics and can be applied on a common animal model while also reducing the sample handling time.
PXD014470	34321230	Tyr(192) Regulates Lymphocyte-Specific Tyrosine Kinase Activity in T Cells. 	Lck phosphorylation status of Lck Tyr192 and Tyr192/Tyr505 mutantsLck phosphorylation status of Lck Tyr192 and Tyr192/Tyr505 mutants	Jurkat-TAg cells, Lck Y192E, Lck Y192F, Lck Y505F, Lck kinase, T cell receptor signalling, T-cells, immunoprecipitation, tyrosine phosphorylation	TCR signaling critically depends on the tyrosine kinase Lck (lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase). Two phosphotyrosines, the activating pTyr(394) and the inhibitory pTyr(505), control Lck activity. Recently, pTyr(192) in the Lck SH2 domain emerged as a third regulator. How pTyr(192) may affect Lck function remains unclear. In this study, we explored the role of Lck Tyr(192) using CRISPR/Cas9-targeted knock-in mutations in the human Jurkat T cell line. Our data reveal that both Lck pTyr(394) and pTyr(505) are controlled by Lck Tyr(192) Lck with a nonphosphorylated SH2 domain (Lck Phe(192)) displayed hyperactivity, possibly by promoting Lck Tyr(394) transphosphorylation. Lck Glu(192) mimicking stable Lck pTyr(192) was inhibited by Tyr(505) hyperphosphorylation. To overcome this effect, we further mutated Tyr(505) The resulting Lck Glu(192)/Phe(505) displayed strongly increased amounts of pTyr(394) both in resting and activated T cells. Our results suggest that a fundamental role of Lck pTyr(192) may be to protect Lck pTyr(394) and/or pTyr(505) to maintain a pool of already active Lck in resting T cells. This provides an additional mechanism for fine-tuning of Lck as well as T cell activity.
PXD021517	34321466	Stearic acid blunts growth-factor signaling via oleoylation of GNAI proteins. 	Stearic acid blunts growth-factor signaling via oleoylation of GNAI proteins	GNAI3, acylation, oleoylation, stearoylation	Covalent attachment of C16:0 to proteins (palmitoylation) regulates protein function. Proteins are also S-acylated by other fatty acids including C18:0. Whether protein acylation with different fatty acids has different functional outcomes is not well studied. We show here that C18:0 (stearate) and C18:1 (oleate) compete with C16:0 to S-acylate Cys3 of GNAI proteins. C18:0 becomes desaturated so that C18:0 and C18:1 both cause S-oleoylation of GNAI. Exposure of cells to C16:0 or C18:0 shifts GNAI acylation towards palmitoylation or oleoylation, respectively. Oleoylation causes GNAI proteins to shift out of cell membrane detergent-resistant fractions where they potentiate EGFR signaling. Consequently, exposure of cells to C18:0 reduces recruitment of Gab1 to EGFR and reduces AKT activation. This provides a molecular mechanism for the anti-tumor effects of C18:0, uncovers a mechanistic link how metabolites affect cell signaling, and provides evidence that the identity of the fatty acid acylating a protein can have functional consequences.
PXD025128	34321666	Rewiring of the ubiquitinated proteome determines ageing in C. elegans. 	Defining changes in the total levels of proteins during aging of C. elegans	C. elegans, aging	Ageing is driven by a loss of cellular integrity(1). Given the major role of ubiquitin modifications in cell function(2), here we assess the link between ubiquitination and ageing by quantifying whole-proteome ubiquitin signatures in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find a remodelling of the ubiquitinated proteome during ageing, which is ameliorated by longevity paradigms such as dietary restriction and reduced insulin signalling. Notably, ageing causes a global loss of ubiquitination that is triggered by increased deubiquitinase activity. Because ubiquitination can tag proteins for recognition by the proteasome(3), a fundamental question is whether deficits in targeted degradation influence longevity. By integrating data from worms with a defective proteasome, we identify proteasomal targets that accumulate with age owing to decreased ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Lowering the levels of age-dysregulated proteasome targets prolongs longevity, whereas preventing their degradation shortens lifespan. Among the proteasomal targets, we find the IFB-2 intermediate filament(4) and the EPS-8 modulator of RAC signalling(5). While increased levels of IFB-2 promote the loss of intestinal integrity and bacterial colonization, upregulation of EPS-8 hyperactivates RAC in muscle and neurons, and leads to alterations in the actin cytoskeleton and protein kinase JNK. In summary, age-related changes in targeted degradation of structural and regulatory proteins across tissues determine longevity.
PXD026664	34322026	Cyclotides Isolated From Violet Plants of Cameroon Are Inhibitors of Human Prolyl Oligopeptidase. 	Cyclotides isolated from violet plants of Cameroon are inhibitors of human prolyl oligopeptidase	Allexis cauliflora, cyclic cystine-rich peptides, peptide, prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), protease inhibitor	Traditional medicine and the use of herbal remedies are well established in the African health care system. For instance, Violaceae plants are used for antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory applications in folk medicine. This study describes the phytochemical analysis and bioactivity screening of four species of the violet tribe Allexis found in Cameroon. Allexis cauliflora, Allexis obanensis, Allexis batangae and Allexis zygomorpha were evaluated for the expression of circular peptides (cyclotides) by mass spectrometry. The unique cyclic cystine-rich motif was identified in several peptides of all four species. Knowing that members of this peptide family are protease inhibitors, the plant extracts were evaluated for the inhibition of human prolyl oligopeptidase (POP). Since all four species inhibited POP activity, a bioactivity-guided fractionation approach was performed to isolate peptide inhibitors. These novel cyclotides, alca 1 and alca 2 exhibited IC50 values of 8.5 and 4.4 microM, respectively. To obtain their amino acid sequence information, combinatorial enzymatic proteolysis was performed. The proteolytic fragments were evaluated in MS/MS fragmentation experiments and the full-length amino acid sequences were obtained by de novo annotation of fragment ions. In summary, this study identified inhibitors of the human protease POP, which is a drug target for inflammatory or neurodegenerative disorders.
PXD021554	34322075	The Impacts of Surgery and Intracerebral Electrodes in C57BL/6J Mouse Kainate Model of Epileptogenesis: Seizure Threshold, Proteomics, and Cytokine Profiles. 	The Impacts of Surgery and Intracerebral Electrodes in C57BL/6J Mouse Kainate Model of Epileptogenesis: Seizure Threshold, Proteomics, and Cytokine Profiles	Intracerebral electrodes, blood-brain barrier, epilepsy, neuroinflammation, proinflammatory cytokines, seizure threshold., traumatic brain injury	Intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used to study epileptogenesis and epilepsy in experimental models. Chronic gliosis and neurodegeneration at the injury site are known to be associated with surgically implanted electrodes in both humans and experimental models. Currently, however, there are no reports on the impact of intracerebral electrodes on proteins in the hippocampus and proinflammatory cytokines in the cerebral cortex and plasma in experimental models. We used an unbiased, label-free proteomics approach to identify the altered proteins in the hippocampus, and multiplex assay for cytokines in the cerebral cortex and plasma of C57BL/6J mice following bilateral surgical implantation of electrodes into the cerebral hemispheres. Seven days following surgery, a repeated low dose kainate (KA) regimen was followed to induce status epilepticus (SE). Surgical implantation of electrodes reduced the amount of KA necessary to induce SE by 50%, compared with mice without surgery. Tissues were harvested 7 days post-SE (i.e., 14 days post-surgery) and compared with vehicle-treated mice. Proteomic profiling showed more proteins (103, 6.8% of all proteins identified) with significantly changed expression (p < 0.01) driven by surgery than by KA treatment itself without surgery (27, 1.8% of all proteins identified). Further, electrode implantation approximately doubled the number of KA-induced changes in protein expression (55, 3.6% of all identified proteins). Further analysis revealed that intracerebral electrodes and KA altered the expression of proteins associated with epileptogenesis such as inflammation (C1q system), neurodegeneration (cystatin-C, galectin-1, cathepsin B, heat-shock protein 25), blood-brain barrier dysfunction (fibrinogen-alpha, serum albumin, alpha2 macroglobulin), and gliosis (vimentin, GFAP, filamin-A). The multiplex assay revealed a significant increase in key cytokines such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL12p70, IFN-gamma, and KC/GRO in the cerebral cortex and some in the plasma in the surgery group. Overall, these findings demonstrate that surgical implantation of depth electrodes alters some of the molecules that may have a role in epileptogenesis in experimental models.
PXD019992	34322482	MicroRNA-494 Regulates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Endothelial Cells. 	A miR-494 dependent feedback loop regulates ER stress (ANAN-376 Project)	Endoplasmic reticulum, isobaric labeling, microRNAs, quantitative proteomics, stress response	Defects in stress responses are important contributors in many chronic conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity-driven pathologies like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Specifically, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is linked with these pathologies and control of ER stress can ameliorate tissue damage. MicroRNAs have a critical role in regulating diverse stress responses including ER stress. Here, we show that miR-494 plays a functional role during ER stress. Pharmacological ER stress inducers (tunicamycin (TCN) and thapsigargin) and hyperglycemia robustly increase the expression of miR-494 in vitro. ATF6 impacts the primary miR-494 levels whereas all three ER stress pathways are necessary for the increase in mature miR-494. Surprisingly, miR-494 pretreatment dampens the induction and magnitude of ER stress in response to TCN in endothelial cells and increases cell viability. Conversely, inhibition of miR-494 increases ER stress de novo and amplifies the effects of ER stress inducers. Using Mass Spectrometry (TMT-MS) we identified 23 proteins that are downregulated by both TCN and miR-494 in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Among these, we found 6 transcripts which harbor a putative miR-494 binding site. We validated the anti-apoptotic gene BIRC5 (survivin) and GINS4 as targets of miR-494 during ER stress. In summary, our data indicates that ER stress driven miR-494 may act in a feedback inhibitory loop to dampen downstream ER stress signaling.
PXD027064	34326347	Nuclear condensates of p300 formed though the structured catalytic core can act as a storage pool of p300 with reduced HAT activity. 	Stearic acid blunts growth-factor signaling via oleoylation of GNAI proteins	GNAI3, acylation	The transcriptional co-activator and acetyltransferase p300 is required for fundamental cellular processes, including differentiation and growth. Here, we report that p300 forms phase separated condensates in the cell nucleus. The phase separation ability of p300 is regulated by autoacetylation and relies on its catalytic core components, including the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, the autoinhibition loop, and bromodomain. p300 condensates sequester chromatin components, such as histone H3 tail and DNA, and are amplified through binding of p300 to the nucleosome. The catalytic HAT activity of p300 is decreased due to occlusion of the active site in the phase separated droplets, a large portion of which co-localizes with chromatin regions enriched in H3K27me3. Our findings suggest a model in which p300 condensates can act as a storage pool of the protein with reduced HAT activity, allowing p300 to be compartmentalized and concentrated at poised or repressed chromatin regions.
PXD025966	34327199	Human Breast Milk Enhances Intestinal Mucosal Barrier Function and Innate Immunity in a Healthy Pediatric Human Enteroid Model. 	Human breast milk enhances intestinal mucosal barrier function and innate immunity in a pediatric human enteroid model	Enteroids, breatsmilk, pediatric	Breastfeeding has been associated with long lasting health benefits. Nutrients and bioactive components of human breast milk promote cell growth, immune development, and shield the infant gut from insults and microbial threats. The molecular and cellular events involved in these processes are ill defined. We have established human pediatric enteroids and interrogated maternal milk's impact on epithelial cell maturation and function in comparison with commercial infant formula. Colostrum applied apically to pediatric enteroid monolayers reduced ion permeability, stimulated epithelial cell differentiation, and enhanced tight junction function by upregulating occludin. Breast milk heightened the production of antimicrobial peptide alpha-defensin 5 by goblet and Paneth cells, and modulated cytokine production, which abolished apical release of pro-inflammatory GM-CSF. These attributes were not found in commercial infant formula. Epithelial cells exposed to breast milk elevated apical and intracellular pIgR and enabled maternal IgA translocation. Proteomic data revealed a breast milk-induced molecular pattern associated with tissue remodeling and homeostasis. Using a novel ex vivo pediatric enteroid model, we have identified distinct cellular and molecular events involved in human milk-mediated improvement of human intestinal physiology and immunity.
PXD026820	34327993	PrSM-Level Side-by-Side Comparison of Online LC-MS Methods with Intact Histone H3 and H4 Proteoforms. 	A PrSM-level Side-by-Side Comparison of On-line LCMS methods on Intact Histone H3 and H4 Proteoforms	ESI-Compatible WCX/HILIC, RPLC, histones, on-line LCMS, post-translation modifications, top-down proteomics	The heterogeneity of histone H3 proteoforms makes histone H3 top-down analysis challenging. To enhance the detection coverage of the proteoforms, performing liquid chromatography (LC) front-end to mass spectrometry (MS) detection is recommended. Here, using optimized electron-transfer/high-energy collision dissociation (EThcD) parameters, we have conducted a proteoform-spectrum match (PrSM)-level side-by-side comparison of reversed-phase LC-MS (RPLC-MS), "dual-gradient" weak cation-exchange/hydrophilic interaction LC-MS (dual-gradient WCX/HILIC-MS), and "organic-rich" WCX/HILIC-MS on the top-down analyses of H3.1, H3.2, and H4 proteins extracted from a HeLa cell culture. While both dual-gradient WCX/HILIC and organic-rich WCX/HILIC could resolve intact H3 and H4 proteoforms by the number of acetylations, the organic-rich method could enhance the separations of different trimethyl/acetyl near-isobaric H3 proteoforms. In comparison with RPLC-MS, both of the WCX/HILIC-MS methods enhanced the qualities of the H3 PrSMs and remarkably improved the range, reproducibility, and confidence in the identifications of H3 proteoforms.
PXD023009	34329527	Plasma nontargeted peptidomics discovers potential biomarkers for major depressive disorder. 	Plasma non-targeted peptidomics discovers potential biomarkers for major depressive disorder	biomarkers, diagnostic model, major depressive disorder, peptidomics, plasma	PURPOSE: There are great demands for identifying biomarkers of major depressive disorder (MDD), a common mental illness with a prevalence of approximately 6%. Finding potential biomarkers to aid MDD diagnosis is in high demand. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, a combination of pretreatment methods named salt-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) and nontargeted peptidomics based on nano-LC-Orbitrap/MS was primarily employed to discover the candidate peptide markers from the plasma of 238 subjects. RESULTS: Many peptides were enriched and identified from the plasma, 42 of which showed significant differences between MDD patients and controls by univariate statistical analysis. A binary logistic regression (BLR) model combined four peptide markers (P1, P9, P17, P29) was established, yielding an overall prediction accuracy of 91.7% and 82.2% in the discovery and validation sets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In conclusion, the excellent performance of the BLR model in both discovery and validation sets demonstrates the robustness of the four peptide markers panel. It is very valuable for quantification of the absolute content of four peptides and further verification.
PXD024202	34329538	Insights into the vision of the hadal snailfish Pseudoliparis swirei through proteomic analysis of the eye. 	The eye proteome of hadal snailfish from Mariana Trench	hadal trench,darkness,eye,vision,opsins	No sunlight can reach the hadal trench, but some fishes dwelling there still have apparent eye morphology. However, whether they are capable of sensing light remains unknown. In this study, the eyes of the dominant hadal endemic snailfish Pseudoliparis swirei from the Mariana Trench were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 2088 proteins were identified in the eye proteome, most of which had at least one hit against public databases and could be mapped to 316 metabolic pathways. Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways directly contributing to visual phototransduction were significantly enriched from the top 10% dominant proteins, implying abundant metabolic activities in the eye and it is still a functional visual organ. One rhodopsin was identified in the eye proteome, sequence analysis indicated that it might have an absorption maximum at ~480 nm and be sensitive to dim blue light. In addition, proteins that might contribute to extreme environment adaptation, such as heat shock proteins and chaperonin-containing T-complex protein 1, were also highly expressed in the eye. Overall, these results provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the vision of hadal snailfish and provide a useful database for further research.
PXD019467	34330708	Metabolic control of nitrogen fixation in rhizobium-legume symbioses. 	How legumes control nitrogen fixation by root nodule bacteria	15N labeling, Rhizobium, bacteroid, pea, protein, quantifiication	Rhizobia induce nodule formation on legume roots and differentiate into bacteroids, which catabolize plant-derived dicarboxylates to reduce atmospheric N2 into ammonia. Despite the agricultural importance of this symbiosis, the mechanisms that govern carbon and nitrogen allocation in bacteroids and promote ammonia secretion to the plant are largely unknown. Using a metabolic model derived from genome-scale datasets, we show that carbon polymer synthesis and alanine secretion by bacteroids facilitate redox balance in microaerobic nodules. Catabolism of dicarboxylates induces not only a higher oxygen demand but also a higher NADH/NAD(+) ratio than sugars. Modeling and (13)C metabolic flux analysis indicate that oxygen limitation restricts the decarboxylating arm of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which limits ammonia assimilation into glutamate. By tightly controlling oxygen supply and providing dicarboxylates as the energy and electron source donors for N2 fixation, legumes promote ammonia secretion by bacteroids. This is a defining feature of rhizobium-legume symbioses.
PXD017076	34330919	Stress-primed secretory autophagy promotes extracellular BDNF maturation by enhancing MMP9 secretion. 	Stress enhances secretory autophagy increasing extracellular Bdnf maturation	Secretome, secretory autophagy, stress	The stress response is an essential mechanism for maintaining homeostasis, and its disruption is implicated in several psychiatric disorders. On the cellular level, stress activates, among other mechanisms, autophagy that regulates homeostasis through protein degradation and recycling. Secretory autophagy is a recently described pathway in which autophagosomes fuse with the plasma membrane rather than with lysosomes. Here, we demonstrate that glucocorticoid-mediated stress enhances secretory autophagy via the stress-responsive co-chaperone FK506-binding protein 51. We identify the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) as one of the proteins secreted in response to stress. Using cellular assays and in vivo microdialysis, we further find that stress-enhanced MMP9 secretion increases the cleavage of pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) to its mature form (mBDNF). BDNF is essential for adult synaptic plasticity and its pathway is associated with major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. These findings unravel a cellular stress adaptation mechanism that bears the potential of opening avenues for the understanding of the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders.
PXD026803	34333533	High-throughput drug screening identifies the ATR-CHK1 pathway as a therapeutic vulnerability of CALR mutated hematopoietic cells. 	Calreticulin mutated hematopoietic cells are vulnerable to ATR-CHK1 pathway inhibition	ATR-CHK1 pathway, Calreticulin mutant, MPN, myeloproliferative neoplasms	Mutations of calreticulin (CALR) are the second most prevalent driver mutations in essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. To identify potential targeted therapies for CALR mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms, we searched for small molecules that selectively inhibit the growth of CALR mutated cells using high-throughput drug screening. We investigated 89 172 compounds using isogenic cell lines carrying CALR mutations and identified synthetic lethality with compounds targeting the ATR-CHK1 pathway. The selective inhibitory effect of these compounds was validated in a co-culture assay of CALR mutated and wild-type cells. Of the tested compounds, CHK1 inhibitors potently depleted CALR mutated cells, allowing wild-type cell dominance in the co-culture over time. Neither CALR deficient cells nor JAK2V617F mutated cells showed hypersensitivity to ATR-CHK1 inhibition, thus suggesting specificity for the oncogenic activation by the mutant CALR. CHK1 inhibitors induced replication stress in CALR mutated cells revealed by elevated pan-nuclear staining for gammaH2AX and hyperphosphorylation of RPA2. This was accompanied by S-phase cell cycle arrest due to incomplete DNA replication. Transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic analyses revealed a replication stress signature caused by oncogenic CALR, suggesting an intrinsic vulnerability to CHK1 perturbation. This study reveals the ATR-CHK1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in CALR mutated hematopoietic cells.
PXD023561	34333885	Characterization of the scavenger cell proteome in mouse and rat liver. 	Characterization of the scavenger cell proteome in mouse and rat liver	Liver, cell heterogeneity, glutamine synthetase, hepatocyte, liver zonation, scavenger cells, subpopulation	The structural-functional organization of ammonia and glutamine metabolism in the liver acinus involves highly specialized hepatocyte subpopulations like glutamine synthetase (GS) expressing perivenous hepatocytes (scavenger cells). However, this cell population has not yet been characterized extensively regarding expression of other genes and potential subpopulations. This was investigated in the present study by proteome profiling of periportal GS-negative and perivenous GS-expressing hepatocytes from mouse and rat. Apart from established markers of GS(+) hepatocytes such as glutamate/aspartate transporter II (GLT1) or ammonium transporter Rh type B (RhBG), we identified novel scavenger cell-specific proteins like basal transcription factor 3 (BTF3) and heat-shock protein 25 (HSP25). Interestingly, BTF3 and HSP25 were heterogeneously distributed among GS(+) hepatocytes in mouse liver slices. Feeding experiments showed that RhBG expression was increased in livers from mice fed with high protein diet compared to standard chow. While spatial distributions of GS and carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) were unaffected, periportal areas constituted by glutaminase 2 (GLS2)-positive hepatocytes were enlarged or reduced in response to high or low protein diet, respectively. The data suggest that the population of perivenous GS(+) scavenger cells is heterogeneous and not uniform as previously suggested which may reflect a functional heterogeneity, possibly relevant for liver regeneration.
PXD026962	34335977	Multi-omic profiling of plasma reveals molecular alterations in children with COVID-19. 	Multi-omic Profiling of Plasma Identify Biomarkers and Pathogenesis of COVID-19 in Children	COVID-19, Children, Multi-omic Profiling	Rationale: Children usually develop less severe symptoms responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) than adults. However, little is known about the molecular alterations and pathogenesis of COVID-19 in children. Methods: We conducted plasma proteomic and metabolomic profilings of the blood samples of a cohort containing 18 COVID-19-children with mild symptoms and 12 healthy children, which were enrolled from hospital admissions and outpatients, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed to identify molecules specifically altered in COVID-19-children. We also developed a machine learning-based pipeline named inference of biomolecular combinations with minimal bias (iBM) to prioritize proteins and metabolites strongly altered in COVID-19-children, and experimentally validated the predictions. Results: By comparing to the multi-omic data in adults, we identified 44 proteins and 249 metabolites differentially altered in COVID-19-children against healthy children or COVID-19-adults. Further analyses demonstrated that both deteriorative immune response/inflammation processes and protective antioxidant or anti-inflammatory processes were markedly induced in COVID-19-children. Using iBM, we prioritized two combinations that contained 5 proteins and 5 metabolites, respectively, each exhibiting a total area under curve (AUC) value of 100% to accurately distinguish COVID-19-children from healthy children or COVID-19-adults. Further experiments validated that all the 5 proteins were up-regulated upon coronavirus infection. Interestingly, we found that the prioritized metabolites inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, and two of them, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and mannitol, also suppressed coronaviral replication, implying a protective role of these metabolites in COVID-19-children. Conclusion: The finding of a strong antagonism of deteriorative and protective effects provided new insights on the mechanism and pathogenesis of COVID-19 in children that mostly underwent mild symptoms. The identified metabolites strongly altered in COVID-19-children could serve as potential therapeutic agents of COVID-19.
PXD023447	34336790	Quantification of Intact O-Glycopeptides on Haptoglobin in Sera of Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Liver Cirrhosis. 	Quantification of intact O-glycopeptides on haptoglobin in sera of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis	Haptoglobin, O-glycosylation	Haptoglobin (Hp) is one of the acute-phase response proteins secreted by the liver, and its aberrant N-glycosylation was previously reported in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Limited studies on Hp O-glycosylation have been previously reported. In this study, we aimed to discover and confirm its O-glycosylation in HCC based on lectin binding and mass spectrometry (MS) detection. First, serum Hp was purified from patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and HCC, respectively. Then, five lectins with Gal or GalNAc monosaccharide specificity were chosen to perform lectin blot, and the results showed that Hp in HCC bound to these lectins in a much stronger manner than that in LC. Furthermore, label-free quantification based on MS was performed. A total of 26 intact O-glycopeptides were identified on Hp, and most of them were elevated in HCC as compared to LC. Among them, the intensity of HYEGS (316)TVPEK (H1N1S1) on Hp was the highest in HCC patients. Increased HYEGS (316)TVPEK (H1N1S1) in HCC was quantified and confirmed using the MS method based on (18)O/(16)O C-terminal labeling and multiple reaction monitoring. This study provided a comprehensive understanding of the glycosylation of Hp in liver diseases.
PXD025607	34336820	Comparative Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics Analysis Reveal the Possible Breed Difference in Yorkshire and Duroc Boar Spermatozoa. 	Porcine spermatozoa proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis	breed, phosphoproteomics, sperm motility, spermatozoa	Sperm cells are of unique elongated structure and function, the development of which is tightly regulated by the existing proteins and the posttranslational modifications (PTM) of these proteins. Based on the phylogenetic relationships of various swine breeds, Yorkshire boar is believed to be distinctly different from Duroc boar. The comprehensive differential proteomics and phosphoproteomics profilings were performed on spermatozoa from both Yorkshire and Duroc boars. By both peptide and PTM peptide quantification followed by statistical analyses, 167 differentially expressed proteins were identified from 1,745 proteins, and 283 differentially expressed phosphopeptides corresponding to 102 unique differentially phosphorylated proteins were measured from 1,140 identified phosphopeptides derived from 363 phosphorylated proteins. The representative results were validated by Western blots. Pathway enrichment analyses revealed that majority of differential expression proteins and differential phosphorylation proteins were primarily concerned with spermatogenesis, male gamete generation, sperm motility, energy metabolism, cilium morphogenesis, axonemal dynein complex assembly, sperm-egg recognition, and capacitation. Remarkably, axonemal dynein complex assembly related proteins, such as SMCP, SUN5, ODF1, AKAP3, and AKAP4 that play a key regulatory role in the sperm physiological functions, were significantly higher in Duroc spermatozoa than that of Yorkshire. Furthermore, phosphorylation of sperm-specific proteins, such as CABYR, ROPN1, CALM1, PRKAR2A, and PRKAR1A, participates in regulation of the boar sperm motility mainly through the cAMP/PKA signal pathway in different breeds, demonstrating that protein phosphorylation may be an important mechanism underlying the sperm diversity. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that the 14 overlapped proteins between differential expression proteins and differential phosphorylation proteins potentially played a key role in sperm development and motility of the flagellum, including the proteins ODF1, SMCP, AKAP4, FSIP2, and SUN5. Taken together, these physiologically and functionally differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins (DPPs) may constitute the proteomic backgrounds between the two different boar breeds. The validation will be performed to delineate the roles of these PTM proteins as modulators of Yorkshire and Duroc boar spermatozoa.
PXD022908	34337362	Identification of response signatures for tankyrase inhibitor treatment in tumor cell lines. 	Identification of response signatures for tankyrase inhibitor treatment in tumor cell lines	Cancer, SILAC, Tankyrase	Small-molecule tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 (TNKS1/2) inhibitors are effective antitumor agents in selected tumor cell lines and mouse models. Here, we characterized the response signatures and the in-depth mechanisms for the antiproliferative effect of tankyrase inhibition (TNKSi). The TNKS1/2-specific inhibitor G007-LK was used to screen 537 human tumor cell lines and a panel of particularly TNKSi-sensitive tumor cell lines was identified. Transcriptome, proteome, and bioinformatic analyses revealed the overall TNKSi-induced response signatures in the selected panel. TNKSi-mediated inhibition of wingless-type mammary tumor virus integration site/beta-catenin, yes-associated protein 1 (YAP), and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/AKT signaling was validated and correlated with lost expression of the key oncogene MYC and impaired cell growth. Moreover, we show that TNKSi induces accumulation of TNKS1/2-containing beta-catenin degradasomes functioning as core complexes interacting with YAP and angiomotin proteins during attenuation of YAP signaling. These findings provide a contextual and mechanistic framework for using TNKSi in anticancer treatment that warrants further comprehensive preclinical and clinical evaluations.
PXD026310	34338531	Quantitative Top-Down Proteomics by Isobaric Labeling with Thiol-Directed Tandem Mass Tags. 	Thiol reactive tandem mass tags for quantitative top-down proteomics	GELFrEE, High pH fractionation, Saccharomyces cerevisae, escherichia coli, iodoTMTsixplex, isobaric labeling, quantitative top-down proteomics	While identification-centric (qualitative) top-down proteomics (TDP) has seen rapid progress in the recent past, the quantification of intact proteoforms within complex proteomes is still challenging. The by far mostly applied approach is label-free quantification, which, however, provides limited multiplexing capacity, and its use in combination with multidimensional separation is encountered with a number of problems. Isobaric labeling, which is a standard quantification approach in bottom-up proteomics, circumvents these limitations. Here, we introduce the application of thiol-directed isobaric labeling for quantitative TDP. For this purpose, we analyzed the labeling efficiency and optimized tandem mass spectrometry parameters for optimal backbone fragmentation for identification and reporter ion formation for quantification. Two different separation schemes, gel-eluted liquid fraction entrapment electrophoresis x liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and high/low-pH LC-MS, were employed for the analyses of either Escherichia coli (E. coli) proteomes or combined E. coli/yeast samples (two-proteome interference model) to study potential ratio compression. While the thiol-directed labeling introduces a bias in the quantifiable proteoforms, being restricted to Cys-containing proteoforms, our approach showed excellent accuracy in quantification, which is similar to that achievable in bottom-up proteomics. For example, 876 proteoforms could be quantified with high accuracy in an E. coli lysate. The LC-MS data were deposited to the ProteomeXchange with the dataset identifier PXD026310.
PXD019859	34338635	Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of splicing factor SRSF1 is required for development and cilia function. 	Translational activity of the splicing factor SRSF1 is required for development and cilia function	SR proteins/ SRSF1/ mRNA translation/ alternative splicing/ cilia	Shuttling RNA-binding proteins coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic steps of gene expression. The SR family proteins regulate RNA splicing in the nucleus and a subset of them, including SRSF1, shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm affecting post-splicing processes. However, the physiological significance of this remains unclear. Here, we used genome editing to knock-in a nuclear retention signal (NRS) in Srsf1 to create a mouse model harboring an SRSF1 protein that is retained exclusively in the nucleus. Srsf1(NRS/NRS) mutants displayed small body size, hydrocephalus, and immotile sperm, all traits associated with ciliary defects. We observed reduced translation of a subset of mRNAs and decreased abundance of proteins involved in multiciliogenesis, with disruption of ciliary ultrastructure and motility in cells and tissues derived from this mouse model. These results demonstrate that SRSF1 shuttling is used to reprogram gene expression networks in the context of high cellular demands, as observed here, during motile ciliogenesis.
PXD020453	34339457	Structural insights into Cullin4-RING ubiquitin ligase remodelling by Vpr from simian immunodeficiency viruses. 	Structural insights into Cullin4-RING ubiquitin ligase remodelling by Vpr from simian immunodeficiency viruses	human cullin vpr crosslinking	Viruses have evolved means to manipulate the host's ubiquitin-proteasome system, in order to down-regulate antiviral host factors. The Vpx/Vpr family of lentiviral accessory proteins usurp the substrate receptor DCAF1 of host Cullin4-RING ligases (CRL4), a family of modular ubiquitin ligases involved in DNA replication, DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. CRL4DCAF1 specificity modulation by Vpx and Vpr from certain simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) leads to recruitment, poly-ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the host restriction factor SAMHD1, resulting in enhanced virus replication in differentiated cells. To unravel the mechanism of SIV Vpr-induced SAMHD1 ubiquitylation, we conducted integrative biochemical and structural analyses of the Vpr protein from SIVs infecting Cercopithecus cephus (SIVmus). X-ray crystallography reveals commonalities between SIVmus Vpr and other members of the Vpx/Vpr family with regard to DCAF1 interaction, while cryo-electron microscopy and cross-linking mass spectrometry highlight a divergent molecular mechanism of SAMHD1 recruitment. In addition, these studies demonstrate how SIVmus Vpr exploits the dynamic architecture of the multi-subunit CRL4DCAF1 assembly to optimise SAMHD1 ubiquitylation. Together, the present work provides detailed molecular insight into variability and species-specificity of the evolutionary arms race between host SAMHD1 restriction and lentiviral counteraction through Vpx/Vpr proteins.
PXD011285	34339723	Proteomic identification of the contents of small extracellular vesicles from in vivo Plasmodium yoelii infection. 	P. yoelii exos                .	exosomes, malaria, yoelii	Small extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, are formed by the endocytic pathway and contain genetic and protein material which reflect the contents of their cells of origin. These contents have a role in vesicle-mediated information transfer, as well as physiological and pathological functions. Thus, these vesicles are of great interest as therapeutic targets, or as vehicles for immunomodulatory control. In Plasmodium spp. infections, vesicles derived from the parasite or parasite-infected cells have been shown to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory elements, which have been correlated with manifestations of clinical disease. Herein, we characterised the protein cargo of naturally occurring sEVs in the plasma of P. yoelii-infected mice. After in vivo infections, extracellular vesicles in the size range of exosomes were collected by sequential centrifugation/ultracentrifugation followed by isopycnic gradient separation. Analysis of the vesicles was performed by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, SDS-PAGE and flow cytometry. LC-MS analysis followed by bioinformatics analysis predicted parasite protein cargo associated with exosomes. Within these small extracellular vesicles, we identified proteins of interest as vaccine candidates, uncharacterized proteins which may be targets of T cell immunoreactivity, and proteins involved in metabolic processes, regulation, homeostasis and immunity. Importantly, the small extracellular vesicles studied in our work were obtained from in vivo infection rather than from the supernatant of in vitro cultures. These findings add to the growing interest in parasite small extracellular vesicles, further our understanding of the interactions between host and parasite, and identify novel proteins which may represent potential targets for vaccination against malaria.
PXD021600	34341504	A general approach to explore prokaryotic protein glycosylation reveals the unique surface layer modulation of an anammox bacterium. 	Anammox enrichment culture glycoproteomics	Microbial glycoproteomics, anammox bacteria, mass binning, metaproteomics	The enormous chemical diversity and strain variability of prokaryotic protein glycosylation makes their large-scale exploration exceptionally challenging. Therefore, despite the universal relevance of protein glycosylation across all domains of life, the understanding of their biological significance and the evolutionary forces shaping oligosaccharide structures remains highly limited. Here, we report on a newly established mass binning glycoproteomics approach that establishes the chemical identity of the carbohydrate components and performs untargeted exploration of prokaryotic oligosaccharides from large-scale proteomics data directly. We demonstrate our approach by exploring an enrichment culture of the globally relevant anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacterium Ca. Kuenenia stuttgartiensis. By doing so we resolve a remarkable array of oligosaccharides, which are produced by two seemingly unrelated biosynthetic routes, and which modify the same surface-layer protein simultaneously. More intriguingly, the investigated strain also accomplished modulation of highly specialized sugars, supposedly in response to its energy metabolism-the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium-which depends on the acquisition of substrates of opposite charges. Ultimately, we provide a systematic approach for the compositional exploration of prokaryotic protein glycosylation, and reveal a remarkable example for the evolution of complex oligosaccharides in bacteria.
PXD021309	34341769	CD209L/L-SIGN and CD209/DC-SIGN Act as Receptors for SARS-CoV-2. 	CD209L/L-SIGN N-Glycosylation and N-Glycosylation Site Occupancy	DC-SIGN, Human CD209L, N-Glycosylation	As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, investigating the processes underlying the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and its hosts is of high importance. Here, we report the identification of CD209L/L-SIGN and the related protein CD209/DC-SIGN as receptors capable of mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. Immunofluorescence staining of human tissues revealed prominent expression of CD209L in the lung and kidney epithelia and endothelia. Multiple biochemical assays using a purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) or S1 encompassing both N termal domain and RBD and ectopically expressed CD209L and CD209 revealed that CD209L and CD209 interact with S-RBD. CD209L contains two N-glycosylation sequons, at sites N92 and N361, but we determined that only site N92 is occupied. Removal of the N-glycosylation at this site enhances the binding of S-RBD with CD209L. CD209L also interacts with ACE2, suggesting a role for heterodimerization of CD209L and ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in cell types where both are present. Furthermore, we demonstrate that human endothelial cells are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and interference with CD209L activity by a knockdown strategy or with soluble CD209L inhibits virus entry. Our observations demonstrate that CD209L and CD209 serve as alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2 in disease-relevant cell types, including the vascular system. This property is particularly important in tissues where ACE2 has low expression or is absent and may have implications for antiviral drug development.
PXD024036	34342534	Species-Specific Endotoxin Stimulus Determines Toll-Like Receptor 4- and Caspase 11-Mediated Pathway Activation Characteristics. 	Global immunoproteomic profiling of endotoxin-stimulated macrophages uncovers specifics of TLR4- and Caspase 11- mediated recognition	LC-MS, LFQ, SILAC	The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense against pathogens and its protection against infectious diseases. On the surface of host myeloid cells, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) senses lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major outer membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria. Intracellularly, LPS is recognized by caspase 11 through the noncanonical inflammasome to induce pyroptosis-an inflammatory form of lytic cell death. While TLR4-mediated signaling perturbations result in secretion of cytokines and chemokines that help clear infection and facilitate adaptive immunity, caspase 11-mediated pyroptosis leads to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns and inflammatory mediators. Although the core signaling events and many associated proteins in the TLR4 signaling pathway are known, the complex signaling events and protein networks within the noncanonical inflammasome pathway remain obscure. Moreover, there is mounting evidence for pathogen-specific innate immune tuning. We characterized the major LPS structures from two different pathogens, modeled their binding to the surface receptors, systematically examined macrophage inflammatory responses to these LPS molecules, and surveyed the temporal differences in global protein secretion resulting from TLR4 and caspase 11 activation in macrophages using mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics. This integrated strategy, spanning functional activity assays, top-down structural elucidation of endotoxins, and secretome analysis of stimulated macrophages, allowed us to identify crucial differences in TLR4- and caspase 11-mediated protein secretion in response to two Gram-negative bacterial endotoxins. IMPORTANCE Macrophages and monocytes are innate immune cells playing an important role in orchestrating the initial innate immune response to bacterial infection and the tissue damage. This response is facilitated by specific receptors on the cell surface and intracellularly. One of the bacterial molecules recognized is a Gram-negative bacteria cell wall component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The structure of LPS differs between different species. We have characterized the innate immune responses to the LPS molecules from two bacteria, Escherichia coli and Bordetella pertussis, administered either extracellularly or intracellularly, whose structures we first determined. We observed marked differences in the temporal dynamics and amounts of proteins secreted by the innate immune cells stimulated by any of these molecules and routes. This suggests that there is specificity in the first line of response to different Gram-negative bacteria that can be explored to tailor specific therapeutic interventions.
PXD037843	34342538	Leveraging Immunopeptidomics To Study and Combat Infectious Disease. 	Immunopeptidomics reveals determinants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen presentation on MHC class I (SureQuant data)	antigen presentation, immunopeptidomics, macrophage, mhc, phagocyte, tb, tuberculosis	T cells must recognize pathogen-derived peptides bound to major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) in order to initiate a cell-mediated immune response against an infection, or to support the development of high-affinity antibody responses. Identifying antigens presented on MHCs by infected cells and professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) during infection may therefore provide a route toward developing new vaccines. Peptides bound to MHCs can be identified at whole-proteome scale using mass spectrometry-a technique referred to as "immunopeptidomics." This technique has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying potential vaccine targets in the context of many infectious diseases. In this review, we discuss the contributions immunopeptidomic studies have made to understanding antigen presentation and T cell priming in the context of infection and the potential for immunopeptidomics to inform the development of vaccines to address pressing global health problems in infectious disease.
PXD026557	34343000	Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics Profiling of Drug-Addicted BRAFi-Resistant Melanoma Cells. 	Proteomic and phosphoproteomics profiling depict drug addiction mechanisms in BRAFi-resistant melanoma	BRAF resistant, EMT, ERK1/MAPK3, ERK2/MAPK1, Melanoma, Phosphoproteomics	Acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitors limits the clinical efficacy in melanoma treatment. We and others have recently shown that BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi)-resistant melanoma cells can develop a dependency on the therapeutic drugs to which they have acquired resistance, creating a vulnerability for these cells that can potentially be exploited in cancer treatment. In drug-addicted melanoma cells, it was shown that this induction of cell death was preceded by a specific ERK2-dependent phenotype switch; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely lacking. To increase the molecular understanding of this drug dependency, we applied a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach on BRAFi-resistant BRAF(MUT) 451Lu cells, in which ERK1, ERK2, and JUNB were silenced separately using CRISPR-Cas9. Inactivation of ERK2 and, to a lesser extent, JUNB prevents drug addiction in these melanoma cells, while, conversely, knockout of ERK1 fails to reverse this phenotype, showing a response similar to that of control cells. Our analysis reveals that ERK2 and JUNB share comparable proteome responses dominated by reactivation of cell division. Importantly, we find that EMT activation in drug-addicted melanoma cells upon drug withdrawal is affected by silencing ERK2 but not ERK1. Moreover, transcription factor (regulator) enrichment shows that PIR acts as an effector of ERK2 and phosphoproteome analysis reveals that silencing of ERK2 but not ERK1 leads to amplification of GSK3 kinase activity. Our results depict possible mechanisms of drug addiction in melanoma, which may provide a guide for therapeutic strategies in drug-resistant melanoma.
PXD026955	34343564	Integrated multiomics analysis identifies molecular landscape perturbations during hyperammonemia in skeletal muscle and myotubes. 	Mitochondrial responses during hyperammonemia	Ammonia, Hyperammonemia, PCA, cytotoxic, portacaval anastomosis	Ammonia is a cytotoxic molecule generated during normal cellular functions. Dysregulated ammonia metabolism, which is evident in many chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, initiates a hyperammonemic stress response in tissues including skeletal muscle and in myotubes. Perturbations in levels of specific regulatory molecules have been reported, but the global responses to hyperammonemia are unclear. In this study, we used a multiomics approach to vertically integrate unbiased data generated using an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing, RNA-Seq, and proteomics. We then horizontally integrated these data across different models of hyperammonemia, including myotubes and mouse and human muscle tissues. Changes in chromatin accessibility and/or expression of genes resulted in distinct clusters of temporal molecular changes including transient, persistent, and delayed responses during hyperammonemia in myotubes. Known responses to hyperammonemia, including mitochondrial and oxidative dysfunction, protein homeostasis disruption, and oxidative stress pathway activation, were enriched in our datasets. During hyperammonemia, pathways that impact skeletal muscle structure and function that were consistently enriched were those that contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and senescence. We made several novel observations, including an enrichment in antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 family protein expression, increased calcium flux, and increased protein glycosylation in myotubes and muscle tissue upon hyperammonemia. Critical molecules in these pathways were validated experimentally. Human skeletal muscle from patients with cirrhosis displayed similar responses, establishing translational relevance. These data demonstrate complex molecular interactions during adaptive and maladaptive responses during the cellular stress response to hyperammonemia.
PXD026977	34343566	Epithelial cell transforming factor ECT2 is an important regulator of DNA double-strand break repair and genome stability. 	Identification of ECT2-containing protein complex	ECT2, Epithelial Cell Transforming 2	Proteins containing breast cancer type 1 (BRCA1) C-terminal domains play crucial roles in response to and repair of DNA damage. Epithelial cell transforming factor (epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 [ECT2]) is a member of the BRCA1 C-terminal protein family, but it is not known if ECT2 directly contributes to DNA repair. In this study, we report that ECT2 is recruited to DNA lesions in a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1-dependent manner. Using co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we showed that ECT2 physically associates with KU70-KU80 and BRCA1, proteins involved in nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination, respectively. ECT2 deficiency impairs the recruitment of KU70 and BRCA1 to DNA damage sites, resulting in defective DNA double-strand break repair, an accumulation of damaged DNA, and hypersensitivity of cells to genotoxic insults. Interestingly, we demonstrated that ECT2 promotes DNA repair and genome integrity largely independently of its canonical guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Together, these results suggest that ECT2 is directly involved in DNA double-strand break repair and is an important genome caretaker.
PXD025515	34343709	Comparative proteome profiling in exosomes derived from porcine colostrum versus mature milk reveals distinct functional proteomes. 	TMT-based quantitative proteomics of exosomes from porcine colostrum and milk	TMT labelling, colostrum, exosomes, extracellular vesicles, milk, orcine, pig	Exosomes are membranous vesicles of endocytic origin, recently been considered as major players in cell-cell communication. Milk is highly complex, and diverse biocomponents provide adequate nutrition, transfer immunity, and promote adequate neonate development. Milk exosomes are suggested to have a key role in these processes, yet to be further explored, and the alteration of the exosomes' cargo in different stages of lactation stages is important for understanding the factors relevant in nursing and also for improving milk replacer products both for humans and animals. We isolated exosomes from porcine milk in different lactation stages and analyzed their content using a TMT-based high-resolution quantitative proteomic approach. Exosomes were isolated using ultracentrifugation coupled with size exclusion chromatography to enrich milk-derived exosomes in samples obtained at day 0, 7, and 14 after parturition, and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and Western blotting. Quantitative proteomics analysis revealed different proteome profiles for colostrum exosomes and milk exosomes. The functional analysis highlighted pathways related to the regulation of homeostasis to be upregulated in colostrum exosomes, and pathways such as endothelial cell development and lipid metabolism to be upregulated in mature milk exosomes. This study endorses the importance of exosomes as active biocomponents of milk and provides knowledge for future studies exploring their role in the regulation of immunity and growth of the newborn. SIGNIFICANCE: The identified functional proteome and protein-protein interaction networks identified in our study help to elucidate the role of milk exosomes in different lactation periods. The results generated herein are of relevance for the basic understanding of their impact on the infant's development but also for bringing forward the manufacturing of milk replacers.
PXD025478	34345994	Increased presence of nuclear DNAJA3 and upregulation of cytosolic STAT1 and of nucleic acid sensors trigger innate immunity in the ClpP-null mouse. 	Complexome profiling of brain mitochondrial membranes from Clpp-/- mouse	neurodegeneration, protein complex assembly, quality control	Mitochondrial dysfunction may activate innate immunity, e.g. upon abnormal handling of mitochondrial DNA in TFAM mutants or in altered mitophagy. Recent reports showed that also deletion of mitochondrial matrix peptidase ClpP in mice triggers transcriptional upregulation of inflammatory factors. Here, we studied ClpP-null mouse brain at two ages and mouse embryonal fibroblasts, to identify which signaling pathways are responsible, employing mass spectrometry, subcellular fractionation, immunoblots, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Several mitochondrial unfolded protein response factors showed accumulation and altered migration in blue-native gels, prominently the co-chaperone DNAJA3. Its mitochondrial dysregulation increased also its extra-mitochondrial abundance in the nucleus, a relevant observation given that DNAJA3 modulates innate immunity. Similar observations were made for STAT1, a putative DNAJA3 interactor. Elevated expression was observed not only for the transcription factors Stat1/2, but also for two interferon-stimulated genes (Ifi44, Gbp3). Inflammatory responses were strongest for the RLR pattern recognition receptors (Ddx58, Ifih1, Oasl2, Trim25) and several cytosolic nucleic acid sensors (Ifit1, Ifit3, Oas1b, Ifi204, Mnda). The consistent dysregulation of these factors from an early age might influence also human Perrault syndrome, where ClpP loss-of-function leads to early infertility and deafness, with subsequent widespread neurodegeneration.
PXD026098	34346674	Phosphorylation of a Human Microprotein Promotes Dissociation of Biomolecular Condensates. 	Phosphorylation of the NBDY microprotein promotes dissociation of biomolecular condensates	EGF, NBDY, cell cycle, phosphorylation	Proteogenomic identification of translated small open reading frames in humans has revealed thousands of microproteins, or polypeptides of fewer than 100 amino acids, that were previously invisible to geneticists. Hundreds of microproteins have been shown to be essential for cell growth and proliferation, and many regulate macromolecular complexes. However, the vast majority of microproteins remain functionally uncharacterized, and many lack secondary structure and exhibit limited evolutionary conservation. One such intrinsically disordered microprotein is NBDY, a 68-amino acid component of membraneless organelles known as P-bodies. In this work, we show that NBDY can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, a biophysical process thought to underlie the formation of membraneless organelles, in the presence of RNA in vitro. Phosphorylation of NBDY drives liquid phase remixing in vitro and macroscopic P-body dissociation in cells undergoing growth factor signaling and cell division. These results suggest that NBDY phosphorylation enables regulation of P-body dynamics during cell proliferation and, more broadly, that intrinsically disordered microproteins may contribute to liquid-liquid phase separation and remixing behavior to affect cellular processes.
PXD027721	34347306	Proteome-wide identification of S-sulphenylated cysteines in Brassica napus. 	We applied an iodoacetyl tandem mass tags (iodoTMT)-based proteomic approach to analyze the redox proteome of Brassica napus seedlings under control and salt-stressed conditions. We identified 1,821 sulfenylated sites in 912 proteins from all samples.	Brassica napus, leaf	Deregulation of reduction-oxidation (redox) metabolism under environmental stresses results in enhanced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which ultimately leads to post-translational modifications (PTMs) of responsive proteins. Redox PTMs play an important role in regulation of protein function and cellular signalling. By means of large-scale redox proteomics, we studied reversible cysteine modification during the response to short-term salt stress in Brassica napus (B. napus). We applied an iodoacetyl tandem mass tags (iodoTMT)-based proteomic approach to analyse the redox proteome of B. napus seedlings under control and salt-stressed conditions. We identified 1,821 sulphenylated sites in 912 proteins from all samples. A great number of sulphenylated proteins were predicted to localize to chloroplasts and cytoplasm and GO enrichment analysis of differentially sulphenylated proteins revealed that metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and glycolysis are enriched and enzymes are overrepresented. Redox-sensitive sites in two enzymes were validated in vitro on recombinant proteins and they might affect the enzyme activity. This targeted approach contributes to the identification of the sulphenylated sites and proteins in B. napus subjected to salt stress and our study will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the redox regulation in response to salt stress.
PXD025207	34348129	HDX-MS-optimized approach to characterize nanobodies as tools for biochemical and structural studies of class IB phosphoinositide 3-kinases. 	An HDX-MS optimised approach to characterise nanobodies as tools for biochemical and structural studies	HDX-MS, PI3K, nanobody	There is considerable interest in developing antibodies as modulators of signaling pathways. One of the most important signaling pathways in higher eukaryotes is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which plays fundamental roles in growth, metabolism, and immunity. The class IB PI3K, PI3Kgamma, is a heterodimeric complex composed of a catalytic p110gamma subunit bound to a p101 or p84 regulatory subunit. PI3Kgamma is a critical component in multiple immune signaling processes and is dependent on activation by Ras and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to mediate its cellular roles. Here we describe the rapid and efficient characterization of multiple PI3Kgamma binding single-chain camelid nanobodies using hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) for structural and biochemical studies. We identify nanobodies that stimulated lipid kinase activity, block Ras activation, and specifically inhibited p101-mediated GPCR activation. Overall, our work reveals insight into PI3Kgamma regulation and identifies sites that may be exploited for therapeutic development.
PXD016654	34348140	Ketogenesis impact on liver metabolism revealed by proteomics of lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation. 	Mouse Liver Lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylome	Liver, Lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation	Ketone bodies are bioactive metabolites that function as energy substrates, signaling molecules, and regulators of histone modifications. beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) is utilized in lysine beta-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of histones, and associates with starvation-responsive genes, effectively coupling ketogenic metabolism with gene expression. The emerging diversity of the lysine acylation landscape prompted us to investigate the full proteomic impact of Kbhb. Global protein Kbhb is induced in a tissue-specific manner by a variety of interventions that evoke beta-OHB. Mass spectrometry analysis of the beta-hydroxybutyrylome in mouse liver revealed 891 sites of Kbhb within 267 proteins enriched for fatty acid, amino acid, detoxification, and one-carbon metabolic pathways. Kbhb inhibits S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (AHCY), a rate-limiting enzyme of the methionine cycle, in parallel with altered metabolite levels. Our results illuminate the role of Kbhb in hepatic metabolism under ketogenic conditions and demonstrate a functional consequence of this modification on a central metabolic enzyme.
PXD022717	34348159	SMC complexes are guarded by the SUMO protease Ulp2 against SUMO-chain-mediated turnover. 	SMC Complexes Are Guarded by the SUMO Protease Ulp2 Against SUMO-Chain-Mediated Turnover	Cohesin, Condensin, Pds5, SENP/Ulp proteases, SMC complexes, STUbL-mediated proteasomal degradation, SUMO, SUMO chains, Slx5/8, Smc5/6	Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMCs) complexes, cohesin, condensin, and Smc5/6, are essential for viability and participate in multiple processes, including sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome condensation, and DNA repair. Here we show that SUMO chains target all three SMC complexes and are antagonized by the SUMO protease Ulp2 to prevent their turnover. We uncover that the essential role of the cohesin-associated subunit Pds5 is to counteract SUMO chains jointly with Ulp2. Importantly, fusion of Ulp2 to kleisin Scc1 supports viability of PDS5 null cells and protects cohesin from proteasomal degradation mediated by the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase Slx5/Slx8. The lethality of PDS5-deleted cells can also be bypassed by simultaneous loss of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) unloader, Elg1, and the cohesin releaser, Wpl1, but only when Ulp2 is functional. Condensin and Smc5/6 complex are similarly guarded by Ulp2 against unscheduled SUMO chain assembly, which we propose to time the availability of SMC complexes on chromatin.
PXD016005	34348895	The exon-junction complex helicase eIF4A3 controls cell fate via coordinated regulation of ribosome biogenesis and translational output. 	U2OS LC MSMS upon siRNA-eIF4A3 or 5nM ActD treatment.	U2OS LC MSMS upon siRNA-eIF4A3 or 5nM ActD treatment.	Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-III (eIF4A3), a core helicase component of the exon junction complex, is essential for splicing, mRNA trafficking, and nonsense-mediated decay processes emerging as targets in cancer therapy. Here, we unravel eIF4A3's tumor-promoting function by demonstrating its role in ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) and p53 (de)regulation. Mechanistically, eIF4A3 resides in nucleoli within the small subunit processome and regulates rRNA processing via R-loop clearance. EIF4A3 depletion induces cell cycle arrest through impaired RiBi checkpoint-mediated p53 induction and reprogrammed translation of cell cycle regulators. Multilevel omics analysis following eIF4A3 depletion pinpoints pathways of cell death regulation and translation of alternative mouse double minute homolog 2 (MDM2) transcript isoforms that control p53. EIF4A3 expression and subnuclear localization among clinical cancer specimens correlate with the RiBi status rendering eIF4A3 an exploitable vulnerability in high-RiBi tumors. We propose a concept of eIF4A3's unexpected role in RiBi, with implications for cancer pathogenesis and treatment.
PXD016320	34349113	Puf6 primes 60S pre-ribosome nuclear export at low temperature. 	Yeast proteomic analysis upon temperature shift	DIA, PUF6, S cerevisiae, SWATH	Productive ribosomal RNA (rRNA) compaction during ribosome assembly necessitates establishing correct tertiary contacts between distant secondary structure elements. Here, we quantify the response of the yeast proteome to low temperature (LT), a condition where aberrant mis-paired RNA folding intermediates accumulate. We show that, at LT, yeast cells globally boost production of their ribosome assembly machinery. We find that the LT-induced assembly factor, Puf6, binds to the nascent catalytic RNA-rich subunit interface within the 60S pre-ribosome, at a site that eventually loads the nuclear export apparatus. Ensemble Foerster resonance energy transfer studies show that Puf6 mimics the role of Mg(2+) to usher a unique long-range tertiary contact to compact rRNA. At LT, puf6 mutants accumulate 60S pre-ribosomes in the nucleus, thus unveiling Puf6-mediated rRNA compaction as a critical temperature-regulated rescue mechanism that counters rRNA misfolding to prime export competence.
PXD024312	34349202	A proteomic platform to identify off-target proteins associated with therapeutic modalities that induce protein degradation or gene silencing. 	A Proteomic Platform to Identify Off-Target Proteins Associated with Therapeutic Modalities that Induce Protein Degradation or Gene Silencing	Proteomic platform for off-target screening for PROTAC or RNAi	Novel modalities such as PROTAC and RNAi have the ability to inadvertently alter the abundance of endogenous proteins. Currently available in vitro secondary pharmacology assays, which evaluate off-target binding or activity of small molecules, do not fully assess the off-target effects of PROTAC and are not applicable to RNAi. To address this gap, we developed a proteomics-based platform to comprehensively evaluate the abundance of off-target proteins. First, we selected off-target proteins using genetics and pharmacology evidence. This process yielded 2813 proteins, which we refer to as the "selected off-target proteome" (SOTP). An iterative algorithm was then used to identify four human cell lines out of 932. The 4 cell lines collectively expressed ~ 80% of the SOTP based on transcriptome data. Second, we used mass spectrometry to quantify the intracellular and extracellular proteins from the selected cell lines. Among over 10,000 quantifiable proteins identified, 1828 were part of the predefined SOTP. The SOTP was designed to be easily modified or expanded, owing to the rational selection process developed and the label free LC-MS/MS approach chosen. This versatility inherent to our platform is essential to design fit-for-purpose studies that can address the dynamic questions faced in investigative toxicology.
PXD025192	34350714	Proteomic analysis to identify markers for response to neoadjuvant treatment in esophageal and gastroesophageal cancer. 	Proteomic Analysis to Identify Markers for Response to Neoadjuvant Treatment in Esophageal and Gastroesophageal Cancer	Esophageal Cancer, Marker	BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer represents a global challenge. Despite significant evolution of treatment protocols in the past decade, recurrence rates are still high and survival rates are poor. Current treatment paradigm for localized gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) carcinoma remains to be further elucidated as for the role of neoadjuvant chemoradiation versus perioperative chemotherapy. AIM: To identify biomarkers for response to chemoradiation in esophageal and gastroesophageal cancer, we performed an in-depth proteomic analysis of esophageal and gastroesophageal tumors, to describe differences in pathway activation between patients with favorable and poor prognosis following neoadjuvant chemoradiation. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiation were included in the cohort. The study cohort was dichotomized into two groups of patients, named "favorable prognosis" and "poor prognosis" according to the postoperative disease-free interval. We performed a mass spectrometry analysis of proteins extracted from the malignant regions of surgical specimens and analyzed data from electronic medical records. Clinical data was correlated with differences in protein expression between patient with a favorable and poor prognosis using validated gene expression pathways. RESULTS: The study included 35 patients with adenocarcinoma. All patients in this cohort had esophageal adenocarcinoma. Patients median age was 62 years. Twenty-five (71.3%) patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and 28.7% underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy only. A proteomic analysis of our cohort identified 2885 proteins. Enrichment levels of 98 of these proteins differed significantly between favorable and poor prognosis cohorts in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation (p < .05) but not in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The favorable prognosis patients group analysis exhibited differential enrichment of 87 proteins related to cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation pathways as well as proteins of the RAS oncogene family. CONCLUSION: In this study we identified differential enrichment of pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation and RAS oncogene pathway in esophageal cancer patients with a favorable response to chemoradiation. Following further validation, our findings may portray potential surrogate signature of biomarkers based upon these pathways.
PXD024214	34350936	A general role for TANGO1, encoded by MIA3, in secretory pathway organization and function. 	Mia3 enables efficient secretion by constraining COPII vesicle budding - cell derived matrix	TANGO1 Mia3 extracellular matrix COPII	Complex machinery is required to drive secretory cargo export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is an essential process in eukaryotic cells. In vertebrates, the MIA3 gene encodes two major forms of transport and Golgi organization protein 1 (TANGO1S and TANGO1L), which have previously been implicated in selective trafficking of procollagen. Using genome engineering of human cells, light microscopy, secretion assays, genomics and proteomics, we show that disruption of the longer form, TANGO1L, results in relatively minor defects in secretory pathway organization and function, including having limited impacts on procollagen secretion. In contrast, loss of both long and short forms results in major defects in cell organization and secretion. These include a failure to maintain the localization of ERGIC53 (also known as LMAN1) and SURF4 to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and dramatic changes to the ultrastructure of the ER-Golgi interface. Disruption of TANGO1 causes significant changes in early secretory pathway gene and protein expression, and impairs secretion not only of large proteins, but of all types of secretory cargo, including small soluble proteins. Our data support a general role for MIA3/TANGO1 in maintaining secretory pathway structure and function in vertebrate cells.
PXD026362	34351703	Proteome-Wide Profiling of Readers for DNA Modification. 	Proteome-wide profiling of Readers for DNA modification	DNA modification, epigenetic regulation	DNA modifications, represented by 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), play important roles in epigenetic regulation of biological processes. The specific recognition of DNA modifications by the transcriptional protein machinery is thought to be a potential mechanism for epigenetic-driven gene regulation, and many modified DNA-specific binding proteins have been uncovered. However, the panoramic view of the roles of DNA modification readers at the proteome level remains largely unclear. Here, a recently developed concatenated tandem array of consensus transcription factor (TF) response elements (catTFREs) approach is employed to profile the binding activity of TFs at DNA modifications. Modified DNA-binding activity is quantified for 1039 TFs, representing 70% of the TFs in the human genome. Additionally, the modified DNA-binding activity of 600 TFs is monitored during the mouse brain development from the embryo to the adult stages. Readers of these DNA modifications are predicted, and the hierarchical networks between the transcriptional protein machinery and modified DNA are described. It is further demonstrated that ZNF24 and ZSCAN21 are potential readers of 5fC-modified DNA. This study provides a landscape of TF-DNA modification interactions that can be used to elucidate the epigenetic-related transcriptional regulation mechanisms under physiological conditions.
PXD027378	34354054	Natural variation in a type-A response regulator confers maize chilling tolerance. 	Analysis of phosphorylation sites of ZmRR1 phosphorylated by ZmMAPK8	ZmMAPK8, ZmRR1, phospho-sites	Maize (Zea mays L.) is a cold-sensitive species that often faces chilling stress, which adversely affects growth and reproduction. However, the genetic basis of low-temperature adaptation in maize remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that natural variation in the type-A Response Regulator 1 (ZmRR1) gene leads to differences in chilling tolerance among maize inbred lines. Association analysis reveals that InDel-35 of ZmRR1, encoding a protein harboring a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) phosphorylation residue, is strongly associated with chilling tolerance. ZmMPK8, a negative regulator of chilling tolerance, interacts with and phosphorylates ZmRR1 at Ser15. The deletion of a 45-bp region of ZmRR1 harboring Ser15 inhibits its degradation via the 26 S proteasome pathway by preventing its phosphorylation by ZmMPK8. Transcriptome analysis indicates that ZmRR1 positively regulates the expression of ZmDREB1 and Cellulose synthase (CesA) genes to enhance chilling tolerance. Our findings thus provide a potential genetic resource for improving chilling tolerance in maize.
PXD025397	34354063	Microfluidic device with brain extracellular matrix promotes structural and functional maturation of human brain organoids. 	Combination of a microfluidic device with brain extracellular matrix promotes structural and functional maturation of human brain organoids	brain extracellular matrix, microfluidic device, organoid	Brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells provide a highly valuable in vitro model to recapitulate human brain development and neurological diseases. However, the current systems for brain organoid culture require further improvement for the reliable production of high-quality organoids. Here, we demonstrate two engineering elements to improve human brain organoid culture, (1) a human brain extracellular matrix to provide brain-specific cues and (2) a microfluidic device with periodic flow to improve the survival and reduce the variability of organoids. A three-dimensional culture modified with brain extracellular matrix significantly enhanced neurogenesis in developing brain organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Cortical layer development, volumetric augmentation, and electrophysiological function of human brain organoids were further improved in a reproducible manner by dynamic culture in microfluidic chamber devices. Our engineering concept of reconstituting brain-mimetic microenvironments facilitates the development of a reliable culture platform for brain organoids, enabling effective modeling and drug development for human brain diseases.
PXD022172	34354069	The middle lipin domain adopts a membrane-binding dimeric protein fold. 	Characterization of m-lipin using HDX-MS	HDX-MS, m-lip domain, m-lipin	Phospholipid synthesis and fat storage as triglycerides are regulated by lipin phosphatidic acid phosphatases (PAPs), whose enzymatic PAP function requires association with cellular membranes. Using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find mouse lipin 1 binds membranes through an N-terminal amphipathic helix, the Ig-like domain and HAD phosphatase catalytic core, and a middle lipin (M-Lip) domain that is conserved in mammalian and mammalian-like lipins. Crystal structures of the M-Lip domain reveal a previously unrecognized protein fold that dimerizes. The isolated M-Lip domain binds membranes both in vitro and in cells through conserved basic and hydrophobic residues. Deletion of the M-Lip domain in lipin 1 reduces PAP activity, membrane association, and oligomerization, alters subcellular localization, diminishes acceleration of adipocyte differentiation, but does not affect transcriptional co-activation. This establishes the M-Lip domain as a dimeric protein fold that binds membranes and is critical for full functionality of mammalian lipins.
PXD024899	34354732	Decipering the Molecular Mechanism of ACE2 Regulating A549 Cells. 	Decipering the molecular mechanism of ACE2 regulating A549 cells	A549 cells, ACE2, proteome-level comparison	Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an aminopeptidase that functions as a part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The RAS pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the local blood flow within a tissue. As a consequence, the role of ACE2 in regulating vasculature properties has been widely appreciated. Additionally, ACE2 has also been reported to show anti-tumorigenic activity. However, the mechanistic basis of this function has remained largely unexplored. In the current study, using a lentivirus-based expression system in lung cancer cells (A549), we show that ACE2 overexpression reduces the viability and migratory potential of cancer cells, highlighting the robust anti-tumorigenic effects of ACE2 function. Moreover, a quantitative proteome-level comparison between ACE2 overexpressed (OE) and empty vector-controlled (NC) cells reveals a large number (227) of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that may have contributed to this phenomenon. Functional enrichment of these DEPs has uncovered that most of them perform binding activities and enzymatic reactions associated with metabolic pathways and various post-transcriptional gene expression regulatory mechanisms. Besides, cellular component analysis reveals that the DEPs function across a range of compartments within a cell with a relatively heterogeneous distribution. Our study, therefore, supports the previously established anti-tumorigenic effects of ACE2 overexpression in lung cancer cells. An analysis based on comprehensive, unbiased, and quantitative proteomics, we have provided a rigorous mechanistic explanation for its functions.
PXD026483	34355211	A size-exclusion-based approach for purifying extracellular vesicles from human plasma. 	Purification of human plasma exosomes for proteomics: optimization and application to detect changes in response to exercise	bioinformatics, high intensity exercise, size-exclusion chromatography, ultracentrifugation	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released into blood from multiple organs and carry molecular cargo that facilitates inter-organ communication and an integrated response to physiological and pathological stimuli. Interrogation of the protein cargo of EVs is currently limited by the absence of optimal and reproducible approaches for purifying plasma EVs that are suitable for downstream proteomic analyses. We describe a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)-based method to purify EVs from platelet-poor plasma (PPP) for proteomics profiling via high-resolution mass spectrometry (SEC-MS). The SEC-MS method identifies more proteins with higher precision than several conventional EV isolation approaches. We apply the SEC-MS method to identify the unique proteomic signatures of EVs released from platelets, adipocytes, muscle cells, and hepatocytes, with the goal of identifying tissue-specific EV markers. Furthermore, we apply the SEC-MS approach to evaluate the effects of a single bout of exercise on EV proteomic cargo in human plasma.
PXD026684	34355692	Naa12 compensates for Naa10 in mice in the amino-terminal acetylation pathway. 	mNaa10-KO liver immunoprecipitation	N-terminal acetylation, NAT, NTA, Naa10, Naa12	Amino-terminal acetylation is catalyzed by a set of N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). The NatA complex (including X-linked Naa10 and Naa15) is the major acetyltransferase, with 40-50% of all mammalian proteins being potential substrates. However, the overall role of amino-terminal acetylation on a whole-organism level is poorly understood, particularly in mammals. Male mice lacking Naa10 show no globally apparent in vivo amino-terminal acetylation impairment and do not exhibit complete embryonic lethality. Rather Naa10 nulls display increased neonatal lethality, and the majority of surviving undersized mutants exhibit a combination of hydrocephaly, cardiac defects, homeotic anterior transformation, piebaldism, and urogenital anomalies. Naa12 is a previously unannotated Naa10-like paralog with NAT activity that genetically compensates for Naa10. Mice deficient for Naa12 have no apparent phenotype, whereas mice deficient for Naa10 and Naa12 display embryonic lethality. The discovery of Naa12 adds to the currently known machinery involved in amino-terminal acetylation in mice.
PXD024584	34355890	Pipelines and Systems for Threshold-Avoiding Quantification of LC-MS/MS Data. 	Pipelines and Systems for Threshold Avoiding Quantification of LC-MS/MS data	LC-MS/MS pre-processing, isotope quantification, label-free	The accurate processing of complex liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data from biological samples is a major challenge for metabolomics, proteomics, and related approaches. Here, we present the pipelines and systems for threshold-avoiding quantification (PASTAQ) LC-MS/MS preprocessing toolset, which allows highly accurate quantification of data-dependent acquisition LC-MS/MS datasets. PASTAQ performs compound quantification using single-stage (MS1) data and implements novel algorithms for high-performance and accurate quantification, retention time alignment, feature detection, and linking annotations from multiple identification engines. PASTAQ offers straightforward parameterization and automatic generation of quality control plots for data and preprocessing assessment. This design results in smaller variance when analyzing replicates of proteomes mixed with known ratios and allows the detection of peptides over a larger dynamic concentration range compared to widely used proteomics preprocessing tools. The performance of the pipeline is also demonstrated in a biological human serum dataset for the identification of gender-related proteins.
PXD022968	34356514	Phosphorylation within Intrinsic Disordered Region Discriminates Histone Variant macroH2A1 Splicing Isoforms-macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2. 	A map of post-translational modifications of macroH2A1 splicing variants  and their interactome	DNA repair, histone	Background: Gene expression in eukaryotic cells can be governed by histone variants, which replace replication-coupled histones, conferring unique chromatin properties. MacroH2A1 is a histone H2A variant containing a domain highly similar to H2A and a large non-histone (macro) domain. MacroH2A1, in turn, is present in two alternatively exon-spliced isoforms: macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, which regulate cell plasticity and proliferation in a remarkably distinct manner. The N-terminal and the C-terminal tails of H2A histones stem from the nucleosome core structure and can be target sites for several post-translational modifications (PTMs). MacroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 isoforms differ only in a few amino acids and their ability to bind NAD-derived metabolites, a property allegedly conferring their different functions in vivo. Some of the modifications on the macroH2A1 variant have been identified, such as phosphorylation (T129, S138) and methylation (K18, K123, K239). However, no study to our knowledge has analyzed extensively, and in parallel, the PTM pattern of macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 in the same experimental setting, which could facilitate the understanding of their distinct biological functions in health and disease. Methods: We used a mass spectrometry-based approach to identify the sites for phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation in green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 expressed in human hepatoma cells. The impact of selected PTMs on macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2 structure and function are demonstrated using computational analyses. Results: We identified K7 as a new acetylation site in both macroH2A1 isoforms. Quantitative comparison of histone marks between the two isoforms revealed significant differences in the levels of phosphorylated T129 and S170. Our computational analysis provided evidence that the phosphorylation status in the intrinsically disordered linker region in macroH2A1 isoforms might represent a key regulatory element contributing to their distinct biological responses. Conclusions: Taken together, our results report different PTMs on the two macroH2A1 splicing isoforms as responsible for their distinct features and distribution in the cell.
PXD024176	34356858	Antisense Oligonucleotide-Based Therapeutic against Menin for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Treatment. 	Interactome of menin in triple negative breast cancer cell line	AP-MS, Menin, Triple negative breast cancer, interactome	The tumor suppressor menin has dual functions, acting either as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene/oncoprotein, depending on the oncological context. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by the lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2/HER2) and is often a basal-like breast cancer. TNBC is associated with a dismal prognosis and an insufficient response to chemotherapies. Previously, menin was shown to play a proliferative role in ER-positive breast cancer; however, the functions of menin in TNBC remain unknown. Here, we have demonstrated that menin is expressed in various TNBC subtypes with the strongest expression in the TNBC Hs 578T cells. The depletion of menin by an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibits cell proliferation, enhances apoptosis in Hs 578T cells, highlighting the oncogenic functions of menin in this TNBC model. ASO-based menin silencing also delays the tumor progression of TNBC xenografts. Analysis of the menin interactome suggests that menin could drive TNBC tumorigenesis through the regulation of MLL/KMT2A-driven transcriptional activity, mRNA 3'-end processing and apoptosis. The study provides a rationale behind the use of ASO-based therapy, targeting menin in monotherapy or in combination with chemo or PARP inhibitors for menin-positive TNBC treatments.
PXD027572	34357131	Tissue- and Liquid-Based Biomarkers in Prostate Cancer Precision Medicine. 	A novel approach for the discovery of biomarkers of radiotherapy response in breast cancer	Human breast cancer, Radioresistance, Radiosensitivity biomarkers, Radiotherapy, Secretome	Worldwide, prostate cancer (PC) is the second-most-frequently diagnosed male cancer and the fifth-most-common cause of all cancer-related deaths. Suspicion of PC in a patient is largely based upon clinical signs and the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Although PSA levels have been criticised for a lack of specificity, leading to PC over-diagnosis, it is still the most commonly used biomarker in PC management. Unfortunately, PC is extremely heterogeneous, and it can be difficult to stratify patients whose tumours are unlikely to progress from those that are aggressive and require treatment intensification. Although PC-specific biomarker research has previously focused on disease diagnosis, there is an unmet clinical need for novel prognostic, predictive and treatment response biomarkers that can be used to provide a precision medicine approach to PC management. In particular, the identification of biomarkers at the time of screening/diagnosis that can provide an indication of disease aggressiveness is perhaps the greatest current unmet clinical need in PC management. Largely through advances in genomic and proteomic techniques, exciting pre-clinical and clinical research is continuing to identify potential tissue, blood and urine-based PC-specific biomarkers that may in the future supplement or replace current standard practices. In this review, we describe how PC-specific biomarker research is progressing, including the evolution of PSA-based tests and those novel assays that have gained clinical approval. We also describe alternative diagnostic biomarkers to PSA, in addition to biomarkers that can predict PC aggressiveness and biomarkers that can predict response to certain therapies. We believe that novel biomarker research has the potential to make significant improvements to the clinical management of this disease in the near future.
PXD025877	34357683	HLA class II immunopeptidomics reveals that co-inherited HLA-allotypes within an extended haplotype can improve proteome coverage for immunosurveillance. 	HLA class II ligandome of C1R BLCL cell line	C1R, DP, DQ, HLA-DR, class II, immunopeptidomics	Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules in humans are encoded by three different loci, HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP. These molecules share approximately 70% sequence similarity and all present peptide ligands to circulating T cells. While the peptide repertoires of numerous HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP allotypes have been examined, there have been few reports on the combined repertoire of these co-inherited molecules expressed in a single cell as an extended HLA haplotype. Here we describe the endogenous peptide repertoire of a human B lymphoblastoid cell line (C1R) expressing the class II haplotype HLA-DR12/DQ7/DP4. We have identified 71350 unique naturally processed peptides presented collectively by HLA-DR12, HLA-DQ7, or HLA-DP4. The resulting "haplodome" is complemented by the cellular proteome defined by standard LC-MS/MS approaches. This large dataset has shed light on properties of these class II ligands especially the preference for membrane and extracellular source proteins. Our data also provides insights into the co-evolution of these conserved haplotypes of closely linked and co-inherited HLA molecules; which together increase sequence coverage of cellular proteins for immune surveillance with minimal overlap between each co-inherited HLA-class II allomorph.
PXD026044	34358002	Extracellular Proteome Analysis Shows the Abundance of Histidine Kinase Sensor Protein, DNA Helicase, Putative Lipoprotein Containing Peptidase M75 Domain and Peptidase C39 Domain Protein in Leptospira interrogans Grown in EMJH Medium. 	Proteomic analysis of extracellular proteins of Leptospira interrogans	LS-MS/MS, Leptospira interrogans	Leptospirosis is a re-emerging form of zoonosis that is caused by the spirochete pathogen Leptospira. Extracellular proteins play critical roles in the pathogenicity and survival of this pathogen in the host and environment. Extraction and analysis of extracellular proteins is a difficult task due to the abundance of enrichments like serum and bovine serum albumin in the culture medium, as is distinguishing them from the cellular proteins that may reach the analyte during extraction. In this study, extracellular proteins were separated as secretory proteins from the culture supernatant and surface proteins were separated during the washing of the cell pellet. The proteins identified were sorted based on the proportion of the cellular fractions and the extracellular fractions. The results showed the identification of 56 extracellular proteins, out of which 19 were exclusively extracellular. For those proteins, the difference in quantity with respect to their presence within the cell was found to be up to 1770-fold. Further, bioinformatics analysis elucidated characteristics and functions of the identified proteins. Orthologs of extracellular proteins in various Leptospira species were found to be closely related among different pathogenic forms. In addition to the identification of extracellular proteins, this study put forward a method for the extraction and identification of extracellular proteins.
PXD023717	34359600	Combined Inhibition of AKT and KIT Restores Expression of Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4) in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor. 	Combined Inhibition of AKT and KIT Restores Expression of Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4) in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	AKT, Gastrointestinal stromal tumor, KIT, PDCD4	The majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients develop resistance to the first-line KIT inhibitor, imatinib mesylate (IM), through acquisition of secondary mutations in KIT or bypass signaling pathway activation. In addition to KIT, AKT is a relevant target for inhibition, since the PI3K/AKT pathway is crucial for IM-resistant GIST survival. We evaluated the activity of a novel pan-AKT inhibitor, MK-4440 (formerly ARQ 751), as monotherapy and in combination with IM in GIST cell lines and preclinical models with varying IM sensitivities. Dual inhibition of KIT and AKT demonstrated synergistic effects in IM-sensitive and -resistant GIST cell lines. Proteomic analyses revealed upregulation of the tumor suppressor, PDCD4, in combination treated cells. Enhanced PDCD4 expression correlated to increased cell death. In vivo studies revealed superior efficacy of MK-4440/IM combination in an IM-sensitive preclinical model of GIST compared with either single agent. The combination demonstrated limited efficacy in two IM-resistant models, including a GIST patient-derived xenograft model possessing an exon 9 KIT mutation. These studies provide strong rationale for further use of AKT inhibition in combination with IM in primary GIST; however, alternative agents will need to be tested in combination with AKT inhibition in the resistant setting.
PXD026078	34359663	Targeting Cancer Metabolism Breaks Radioresistance by Impairing the Stress Response. 	Impaired stability of tumor cells after targeting of lactate/pyruvate metabolism investigated by shotgun proteomics	LDHA/B double knockout, heat shock proteins, lactate/pyruvate metabolism, membrane Hsp70 expression, radiosensitivity	The heightened energetic demand increases lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, the corresponding oncometabolite lactate, expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and thereby promotes therapy resistance in many malignant tumor cell types. Therefore, we assessed the coregulation of LDH and the heat shock response with respect to radiation resistance in different tumor cells (B16F10 murine melanoma and LS174T human colorectal adenocarcinoma). The inhibition of LDH activity by oxamate or GNE-140, glucose deprivation and LDHA/B double knockout (LDH(-)(/)(-)) in B16F10 and LS174T cells significantly diminish tumor growth; ROS production and the cytosolic expression of different HSPs, including Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hsp27 concomitant with a reduction of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1)/pHSF1. An altered lipid metabolism mediated by a LDHA/B double knockout results in a decreased presence of the Hsp70-anchoring glycosphingolipid Gb3 on the cell surface of tumor cells, which, in turn, reduces the membrane Hsp70 density and increases the extracellular Hsp70 levels. Vice versa, elevated extracellular lactate/pyruvate concentrations increase the membrane Hsp70 expression in wildtype tumor cells. Functionally, an inhibition of LDH causes a generalized reduction of cytosolic and membrane-bound HSPs in tumor cells and significantly increases the radiosensitivity, which is associated with a G2/M arrest. We demonstrate that targeting of the lactate/pyruvate metabolism breaks the radioresistance by impairing the stress response.
PXD025925	34359700	Comprehensive Library Generation for Identification and Quantification of Endometrial Cancer Protein Biomarkers in Cervico-Vaginal Fluid. 	Comprehensive spectral  library generation for identification and quantification of endometrial cancer protein biomarkers in cervico-vaginal fluid	biomarkers, cervico-vaginal fluid, endemetrial cancer, spectral library	Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological malignancy in high-income countries and its incidence is rising. Early detection, aided by highly sensitive and specific biomarkers, has the potential to improve outcomes as treatment can be provided when it is most likely to effect a cure. Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS), an accurate and reproducible platform for analysing biological samples, offers a technological advance for biomarker discovery due to its reproducibility, sensitivity and potential for data re-interrogation. SWATH-MS requires a spectral library in order to identify and quantify peptides from multiplexed mass spectrometry data. Here we present a bespoke spectral library of 154,206 transitions identifying 19,394 peptides and 2425 proteins in the cervico-vaginal fluid of postmenopausal women with, or at risk of, endometrial cancer. We have combined these data with a library of over 6000 proteins generated based on mass spectrometric analysis of two endometrial cancer cell lines. This unique resource enables the study of protein biomarkers for endometrial cancer detection in cervico-vaginal fluid. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with unique identifier PXD025925.
PXD027404	34359790	Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomic Discovery of Prognostic Biomarkers in Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma. 	Mass spectrometry-based proteomics discovery of prognostic biomarkers in adrenal cortical carcinoma	FFPE, LFQ, adrenal cortical carcinoma, biomarkers	Adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC) is an extremely rare disease with a variable prognosis. Current prognostic markers have limitations in identifying patients with a poor prognosis. Herein, we aimed to investigate the prognostic protein biomarkers of ACC using mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. We performed the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues of 45 adrenal tumors. Then, we selected 117 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among tumors with different stages using the machine learning algorithm. Next, we conducted a survival analysis to assess whether the levels of DEPs were related to survival. Among 117 DEPs, HNRNPA1, C8A, CHMP6, LTBP4, SPR, NCEH1, MRPS23, POLDIP2, and WBSCR16 were significantly correlated with the survival of ACC. In age- and stage-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models, only HNRNPA1, LTBP4, MRPS23, POLDIP2, and WBSCR16 expression remained significant. These five proteins were also validated in TCGA data as the prognostic biomarkers. In this study, we found that HNRNPA1, LTBP4, MRPS23, POLDIP2, and WBSCR16 were protein biomarkers for predicting the prognosis of ACC.
PXD021267	34359847	The Arabidopsis Root Tip (Phospho)Proteomes at Growth-Promoting versus Growth-Repressing Conditions Reveal Novel Root Growth Regulators. 	Auxin-triggered changes in the Arabidopsis root tip (phospho)proteome reveal novel root growth regulators	Auxin, Phosphoproteomoics, Plant	Auxin plays a dual role in growth regulation and, depending on the tissue and concentration of the hormone, it can either promote or inhibit division and expansion processes in plants. Recent studies have revealed that, beyond transcriptional reprogramming, alternative auxin-controlled mechanisms regulate root growth. Here, we explored the impact of different concentrations of the synthetic auxin NAA that establish growth-promoting and -repressing conditions on the root tip proteome and phosphoproteome, generating a unique resource. From the phosphoproteome data, we pinpointed (novel) growth regulators, such as the RALF34-THE1 module. Our results, together with previously published studies, suggest that auxin, H(+)-ATPases, cell wall modifications and cell wall sensing receptor-like kinases are tightly embedded in a pathway regulating cell elongation. Furthermore, our study assigned a novel role to MKK2 as a regulator of primary root growth and a (potential) regulator of auxin biosynthesis and signalling, and suggests the importance of the MKK2 Thr(31) phosphorylation site for growth regulation in the Arabidopsis root tip.
PXD026182	34360601	Muscular and Molecular Pathology Associated with SPATA5 Deficiency in a Child with EHLMRS. 	Muscular and molecular pathology associated with SPATA5-deficiency in a child with EHLMRS	EHLMRS, SPATA5, mitochondrial disorder, muscle proteomics, myopathology	Mutations in the SPATA5 gene are associated with epilepsy, hearing loss and mental retardation syndrome (EHLMRS). While SPATA5 is ubiquitously expressed and is attributed a role within mitochondrial morphogenesis during spermatogenesis, there is only limited knowledge about the associated muscular and molecular pathology. This study reports on a comprehensive workup of muscular pathology, including proteomic profiling and microscopic studies, performed on an 8-year-old girl with typical clinical presentation of EHLMRS, where exome analysis revealed two clinically relevant, compound-heterozygous variants in SPATA5. Proteomic profiling of a quadriceps biopsy showed the dysregulation of 82 proteins, out of which 15 were localized in the mitochondrion, while 19 were associated with diseases presenting with phenotypical overlap to EHLMRS. Histological staining of our patient's muscle biopsy hints towards mitochondrial pathology, while the identification of dysregulated proteins attested to the vulnerability of the cell beyond the mitochondria. Through our study we provide insights into the molecular etiology of EHLMRS and provide further evidence for a muscle pathology associated with SPATA5 deficiency, including a pathological histochemical pattern accompanied by dysregulated protein expression.
PXD025223	34360674	Comparative Proteomic and Metabolomic Analysis of Human Osteoblasts, Differentiated from Dental Pulp Stem Cells, Hinted Crucial Signaling Pathways Promoting Osteogenesis. 	Comparative proteomic and metabolomic analysis of human osteoblasts differentiated from dental pulp stem cells	Homo sapiens, NMR, bone metabolism, label-free quantification, late osteoblast, mineralization phase, osteodifferentiation, signaling pathways	Population aging has been a global trend for the last decades, which increases the pressure to develop new cell-based or drug-based therapies, including those that may cure bone diseases. To understand molecular processes that underlie bone development and turnover, we followed osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) using a specific induction medium. The differentiation process imitating in vivo osteogenesis is triggered by various signaling pathways and is associated with massive proteome and metabolome changes. Proteome was profiled by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography and comprehensively quantified by ion mobility-enhanced mass spectrometry. From 2667 reproducibly quantified and identified proteins, 432 were differentially abundant by strict statistic criteria. Metabolome profiling was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance. From 27 detected metabolites, 8 were differentially accumulated. KEGG and MetaboAnalyst hinted metabolic pathways that may be involved in the osteogenic process. Enrichment analysis of differentially abundant proteins highlighted PPAR, FoxO, JAK-STAT, IL-17 signaling pathways, biosynthesis of thyroid hormones and steroids, mineral absorption, and fatty acid metabolism as processes with prominent impact on osteoinduction. In parallel, metabolomic data showed that aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, as well as specific amino acids, likely promote osteodifferentiation. Targeted immunoassays validated and complemented omic results. Our data underlined the complexity of the osteogenic mechanism. Finally, we proposed promising targets for future validation in patient samples, a step toward the treatment of bone defects.
PXD024953	34360718	A Proteomic Study Suggests Stress Granules as New Potential Actors in Radiation-Induced Bystander Effects. 	Proteomic analysis of exoproteomes of human cells upon bystander effects induced by irradiated chondrosarcoma cells	by-stander effects, cancer, chondrocyte, exoproteome, human cell line, secretome	Besides the direct effects of radiations, indirect effects are observed within the surrounding non-irradiated area; irradiated cells relay stress signals in this close proximity, inducing the so-called radiation-induced bystander effect. These signals received by neighboring unirradiated cells induce specific responses similar with those of direct irradiated cells. To understand the cellular response of bystander cells, we performed a 2D gel-based proteomic study of the chondrocytes receiving the conditioned medium of low-dose irradiated chondrosarcoma cells. The conditioned medium was directly analyzed by mass spectrometry in order to identify candidate bystander factors involved in the signal transmission. The proteomic analysis of the bystander chondrocytes highlighted 20 proteins spots that were significantly modified at low dose, implicating several cellular mechanisms, such as oxidative stress responses, cellular motility, and exosomes pathways. In addition, the secretomic analysis revealed that the abundance of 40 proteins in the conditioned medium of 0.1 Gy irradiated chondrosarcoma cells was significantly modified, as compared with the conditioned medium of non-irradiated cells. A large cluster of proteins involved in stress granules and several proteins involved in the cellular response to DNA damage stimuli were increased in the 0.1 Gy condition. Several of these candidates and cellular mechanisms were confirmed by functional analysis, such as 8-oxodG quantification, western blot, and wound-healing migration tests. Taken together, these results shed new lights on the complexity of the radiation-induced bystander effects and the large variety of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved, including the identification of a new potential actor, namely the stress granules.
PXD017216	34360779	Divalent Metal Transporter 1 Knock-Down Modulates IL-1beta Mediated Pancreatic Beta-Cell Pro-Apoptotic Signaling Pathways through the Autophagic Machinery. 	Protective impact on the apoptotic pathway by suppressing DMT1 during inflammatory stress	ROS, degradation pathway, diabetes, oxidative stress, signaling	Pro-inflammatory cytokines promote cellular iron-import through enhanced divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) expression in pancreatic beta-cells, consequently cell death. Inhibition of beta-cell iron-import by DMT1 silencing protects against apoptosis in animal models of diabetes. However, how alterations of signaling networks contribute to the protective action of DMT1 knock-down is unknown. Here, we performed phosphoproteomics using our sequential enrichment strategy of mRNA, protein, and phosphopeptides, which enabled us to explore the concurrent molecular events in the same set of wildtype and DMT1-silenced beta-cells during IL-1beta exposure. Our findings reveal new phosphosites in the IL-1beta-induced proteins that are clearly reverted by DMT1 silencing towards their steady-state levels. We validated the levels of five novel phosphosites of the potential protective proteins using parallel reaction monitoring. We also confirmed the inactivation of autophagic flux that may be relevant for cell survival induced by DMT1 silencing during IL-1beta exposure. Additionally, the potential protective proteins induced by DMT1 silencing were related to insulin secretion that may lead to improving beta-cell functions upon exposure to IL-1beta. This global profiling has shed light on the signal transduction pathways driving the protection against inflammation-induced cell death in beta-cells after DMT1 silencing.
PXD024269	34361015	DIA-Based Quantitative Proteomics Reveals the Protein Regulatory Networks of Floral Thermogenesis in Nelumbo nucifera. 	DIA-based quantitative proteomics reveals the protein regulatory networks of floral thermogenesis in Nelumbo nucifera	DIA-based quantitative proteomics, Floral thermogenesis, Nelumbo nucifera, Protein-protein interaction network, Time series analysis, WGCNA	The sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) can maintain a stable floral chamber temperature between 30 and 35 degreesC when blooming despite fluctuations in ambient temperatures between about 8 and 45 degreesC, but the regulatory mechanism of floral thermogenesis remains unclear. Here, we obtained comprehensive protein profiles from receptacle tissue at five developmental stages using data-independent acquisition (DIA)-based quantitative proteomics technology to reveal the molecular basis of floral thermogenesis of N. nucifera. A total of 6913 proteins were identified and quantified, of which 3513 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were screened. Among them, 640 highly abundant proteins during the thermogenic stages were mainly involved in carbon metabolism processes such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Citrate synthase was identified as the most connected protein in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Next, the content of alternative oxidase (AOX) and plant uncoupling protein (pUCP) in different tissues indicated that AOX was specifically abundant in the receptacles. Subsequently, a protein module highly related to the thermogenic phenotype was identified by the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). In summary, the regulation mechanism of floral thermogenesis in N. nucifera involves complex regulatory networks, including TCA cycle metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, fatty acid degradation, and ubiquinone synthesis, etc.
PXD022995	34362734	Cellular costs underpin micronutrient limitation in phytoplankton. 	Ross Sea Surface Water Metaproteomics	phytoplankton	Micronutrients control phytoplankton growth in the ocean, influencing carbon export and fisheries. It is currently unclear how micronutrient scarcity affects cellular processes and how interdependence across micronutrients arises. We show that proximate causes of micronutrient growth limitation and interdependence are governed by cumulative cellular costs of acquiring and using micronutrients. Using a mechanistic proteomic allocation model of a polar diatom focused on iron and manganese, we demonstrate how cellular processes fundamentally underpin micronutrient limitation, and how they interact and compensate for each other to shape cellular elemental stoichiometry and resource interdependence. We coupled our model with metaproteomic and environmental data, yielding an approach for estimating biogeochemical metrics, including taxon-specific growth rates. Our results show that cumulative cellular costs govern how environmental conditions modify phytoplankton growth.
PXD023207	34363007	Identification of pimavanserin tartrate as a potent Ca(2+)-calcineurin-NFAT pathway inhibitor for glioblastoma therapy. 	Identification of Pimavanserin tartrate as a Potent Ca2+-Calcineurin-NFAT Pathway Inhibitor for Glioblastoma Therapy	Glioblastoma multiforme,Pimavanserin	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant type of primary brain tumor, and 95% of patients die within 2 years after diagnosis. In this study, aiming to overcome chemoresistance to the first-line drug temozolomide (TMZ), we carried out research to discover a novel alternative drug targeting the oncogenic NFAT signaling pathway for GBM therapy. To accelerate the drug's clinical application, we took advantage of a drug repurposing strategy to identify novel NFAT signaling pathway inhibitors. After screening a set of 93 FDA-approved drugs with simple structures, we identified pimavanserin tartrate (PIM), an effective 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease-associated psychiatric symptoms, as having the most potent inhibitory activity against the NFAT signaling pathway. Further study revealed that PIM suppressed STIM1 puncta formation to inhibit store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and subsequent NFAT activity. In cellula, PIM significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, division, and motility of U87 glioblastoma cells, induced G1/S phase arrest and promoted apoptosis. In vivo, the growth of subcutaneous and orthotopic glioblastoma xenografts was markedly suppressed by PIM. Unbiased omics studies revealed the novel molecular mechanism of PIM's antitumor activity, which included suppression of the ATR/CDK2/E2F axis, MYC, and AuroraA/B signaling. Interestingly, the genes upregulated by PIM were largely associated with cholesterol homeostasis, which may contribute to PIM's side effects and should be given more attention. Our study identified store-operated calcium channels as novel targets of PIM and was the first to systematically highlight the therapeutic potential of pimavanserin tartrate for glioblastoma.
PXD021590	34363355	A CD10-OGP Membrane Peptolytic Signaling Axis in Fibroblasts Regulates Lipid Metabolism of Cancer Stem Cells via SCD1. 	Peptide profiles in interstitial fluid of breast cancer samples with high or low CD10+ CAF infiltration	breast cancer, tumor interstitial fluid	Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) consist of heterogeneous subpopulations that play a critical role in the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment. The extracellular signals of CAFs have been attributed to the extracellular matrix, cytokines, cell surface checkpoints, and exosomes. In the present study, it is demonstrated that the CD10 transmembrane hydrolase expressed on a subset of CAFs supports tumor stemness and induces chemoresistance. Mechanistically, CD10 degenerates an antitumoral peptide termed osteogenic growth peptide (OGP). OGP restrains the expression of rate-limiting desaturase SCD1 and inhibits lipid desaturation, which is required for cancer stem cells (CSCs). Targeting CD10 significantly improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo. Clinically, CD10-OGP signals are associated with the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. The collective data suggest that a nexus between the niche and lipid metabolism in CSCs is a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer.
PXD023412	34363538	Global effects of RAB3GAP1 dysexpression on the proteome of mouse cortical neurons. 	Global effects of RAB3GAP1 dysexpression on the proteome of mouse cortical neurons	PRM, RAB3GAP1, cortical neuron, iTRAQ, quantitative proteomics	Mounting studies have demonstrated that RAB3GAP1 expression is modified in brain diseases with multiple neurobiological functions and processes and acts as a potentially significant target. However, the cellular and molecular events arising from RAB3GAP1 dysexpression are still incompletely understood. In this work, underexpression and overexpression of RAB3GAP1 were first induced into cultured mouse cortical neurons by transfection with lentivirus plasmids. Then we globally explored the effects of RAB3GAP1 dysexpression on the proteome of the neurons through the use of isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics with bioinformatics. A total of 364 proteins in the RAB3GAP1-underexpression group and 314 proteins in the RAB3GAP1-overexpression group were identified to be differentially expressed. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis indicated that the proteome functional expression profiles induced by RAB3GAP1 underexpression and overexpression were different, suggesting the potential differences in biological processes and cellular effects. Subsequent intergroup cross-comparison revealed some candidate target proteins regulated directly by RAB3GAP1. Further parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis illustrated that Sub1, Ssrp1, and Top1 proteins might serve as new potentially important linkers in the RAB3GAP1-mediated autophagy pathway in the cortical neurons. Collectively, the current proteomics data furnished new valuable insights to better understand the regulatory molecular mechanism of neuronal RAB3GAP1.
PXD024183	34367082	Clostridium cellulovorans Proteomic Responses to Butanol Stress. 	Clostridium cellulovorans proteomic responses to butanol stress	ATPase, Hfq, Rex, heat shock proteins, stringent response	Combination of butanol-hyperproducing and hypertolerant phenotypes is essential for developing microbial strains suitable for industrial production of bio-butanol, one of the most promising liquid biofuels. Clostridium cellulovorans is among the microbial strains with the highest potential for direct production of n-butanol from lignocellulosic wastes, a process that would significantly reduce the cost of bio-butanol. However, butanol exhibits higher toxicity compared to ethanol and C. cellulovorans tolerance to this solvent is low. In the present investigation, comparative gel-free proteomics was used to study the response of C. cellulovorans to butanol challenge and understand the tolerance mechanisms activated in this condition. Sequential Window Acquisition of all Theoretical fragment ion spectra Mass Spectrometry (SWATH-MS) analysis allowed identification and quantification of differentially expressed soluble proteins. The study data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD024183. The most important response concerned modulation of protein biosynthesis, folding and degradation. Coherent with previous studies on other bacteria, several heat shock proteins (HSPs), involved in protein quality control, were up-regulated such as the chaperones GroES (Cpn10), Hsp90, and DnaJ. Globally, our data indicate that protein biosynthesis is reduced, likely not to overload HSPs. Several additional metabolic adaptations were triggered by butanol exposure such as the up-regulation of V- and F-type ATPases (involved in ATP synthesis/generation of proton motive force), enzymes involved in amino acid (e.g., arginine, lysine, methionine, and branched chain amino acids) biosynthesis and proteins involved in cell envelope re-arrangement (e.g., the products of Clocel_4136, Clocel_4137, Clocel_4144, Clocel_4162 and Clocel_4352, involved in the biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids) and a redistribution of carbon flux through fermentative pathways (acetate and formate yields were increased and decreased, respectively). Based on these experimental findings, several potential gene targets for metabolic engineering strategies aimed at improving butanol tolerance in C. cellulovorans are suggested. This includes overexpression of HSPs (e.g., GroES, Hsp90, DnaJ, ClpC), RNA chaperone Hfq, V- and F-type ATPases and a number of genes whose function in C. cellulovorans is currently unknown.
PXD027051	34368150	Extracellular Vesicles From the Human Natural Killer Cell Line NK3.3 Have Broad and Potent Anti-Tumor Activity. 	Proteomic analysis of NK3.3-derived extracellular vesicles	NK3.3, NKLAM, RNF19b, exosome, extracellular vesicle, leukemia, natural killer cell, ubiquitin ligase	Natural killer (NK) cells are critical mediators of immune function, responsible for rapid destruction of tumor cells. They kill primarily through the release of granules containing potent cytolytic molecules. NK cells also release these molecules within membrane-bound exosomes and microvesicles - collectively known as extracellular vesicles (EV). Here we report the characterization and anti-tumor function of EVs isolated from NK3.3 cells, a well described clonal normal human NK cell line. We show that NK3.3 EVs contain the cytolytic molecules perforin, granzymes A and B, and granulysin, and an array of common EV proteins. We previously reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase, natural killer lytic-associated molecule (NKLAM), is localized to NK granules and is essential for maximal NK killing; here we show it is present in the membrane of NK3.3 EVs. NK3.3-derived EVs also carry multiple RNA species, including miRNAs associated with anti-tumor activity. We demonstrate that NK3.3 EVs inhibit proliferation and induce caspase-mediated apoptosis and cell death of an array of both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumor cell lines. This effect is tumor cell specific; normal cells are unaffected by EV treatment. By virtue of their derivation from a healthy donor and ability to be expanded to large numbers, NK3.3 EVs have the potential to be an effective, safe, and universal immunotherapeutic agent.
PXD025414	34368825	Extensive heterogeneity of glycopeptides in plasma revealed by deep glycoproteomic analysis using size-exclusion chromatography. 	Extensive heterogeneity of glycopeptides in plasma revealed by deep glycoproteomic analysis	N-glycoproteomics, Plasma glycoproteomics, Size exclusion chromatography	Several plasma glycoproteins are clinically useful as biomarkers in a variety of diseases. Although thousands of proteins are present in plasma, >95% of the plasma proteome by mass is represented by only 22 proteins. This necessitates strategies to deplete the abundant proteins and enrich other subsets of proteins. Although glycoproteins are abundant in plasma, in routine proteomic analyses, glycopeptides are not often investigated. Traditional methods such as lectin-based enrichment of glycopeptides followed by deglycosylation have helped understand the glycoproteome, but they lack any information about the attached glycans. Here, we apply size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) as a simple strategy to enrich intact N-glycopeptides based on their larger size which achieves broad selectivity regardless of the nature of attached glycans. Using this approach, we identified 1317 N-glycopeptides derived from 266 glycosylation sites on 154 plasma glycoproteins. The deep coverage achieved by this approach was evidenced by extensive heterogeneity that was observed. For instance, 20-100 glycopeptides were observed per protein for the 15 most-glycosylated glycoproteins. Notably, we discovered 615 novel glycopeptides of which 39 glycosylation sites (from 38 glycoproteins) were not included in protein databases such as Uniprot and GlyConnectDB. Finally, we also identified 12 novel glycopeptides containing di-sialic acid, which is a rare glycan epitope. Our results demonstrate the utility of SEC for efficient LC-MS/MS-based deep glycoproteomics analysis of human plasma. Overall, the SEC-based method described here is a simple, rapid and high-throughput strategy for characterization of any glycoproteome.
PXD026353	34368969	SCF(Fbxw5) targets kinesin-13 proteins to facilitate ciliogenesis. 	SCFFbxw5 targets kinesin-13 proteins to facilitate ciliogenesis	Cullin-RING ligase / ubiquitin / Fbxw5 / MCAK / cilia	Microtubule depolymerases of the kinesin-13 family play important roles in various cellular processes and are frequently overexpressed in different cancer types. Despite the importance of their correct abundance, remarkably little is known about how their levels are regulated in cells. Using comprehensive screening on protein microarrays, we identified 161 candidate substrates of the multi-subunit ubiquitin E3 ligase SCF(Fbxw5) , including the kinesin-13 member Kif2c/MCAK. In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrate that MCAK and its closely related orthologs Kif2a and Kif2b become efficiently polyubiquitylated by neddylated SCF(Fbxw5) and Cdc34, without requiring preceding modifications. In cells, SCF(Fbxw5)  targets MCAK for proteasomal degradation predominantly during G2 . While this seems largely dispensable for mitotic progression, loss of Fbxw5 leads to increased MCAK levels at basal bodies and impairs ciliogenesis in the following G1 /G0 , which can be rescued by concomitant knockdown of MCAK, Kif2a or Kif2b. We thus propose a novel regulatory event of ciliogenesis that begins already within the G2 phase of the preceding cell cycle.
PXD018823	34370039	A novel cell-cycle-regulated interaction of the Bloom syndrome helicase BLM with Mcm6 controls replication-linked processes. 	BLM complex composition in unperturbed cells	GM00637, Q Exactive Plus	The Bloom syndrome DNA helicase BLM contributes to chromosome stability through its roles in double-strand break repair by homologous recombination and DNA replication fork restart during the replication stress response. Loss of BLM activity leads to Bloom syndrome, which is characterized by extraordinary cancer risk and small stature. Here, we have analyzed the composition of the BLM complex during unperturbed S-phase and identified a direct physical interaction with the Mcm6 subunit of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex. Using distinct binding sites, BLM interacts with the N-terminal domain of Mcm6 in G1 phase and switches to the C-terminal Cdt1-binding domain of Mcm6 in S-phase, with a third site playing a role for Mcm6 binding after DNA damage. Disruption of Mcm6-binding to BLM in S-phase leads to supra-normal DNA replication speed in unperturbed cells, and the helicase activity of BLM is required for this increased replication speed. Upon disruption of BLM/Mcm6 interaction, repair of replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks is delayed and cells become hypersensitive to DNA damage and replication stress. Our findings reveal that BLM not only plays a role in the response to DNA damage and replication stress, but that its physical interaction with Mcm6 is required in unperturbed cells, most notably in S-phase as a negative regulator of replication speed.
PXD025641	34370447	Chemical Modifications Induced by Phthalic Anhydride, a Respiratory Sensitizer, in Reconstructed Human Epidermis: A Combined HRMAS NMR and LC-MS/MS Proteomic Approach. 	Chemical modifications induced by phthalic anhydride, a respiratory sensitizer, in reconstructed human epidermis: A combined HRMAS NMR and LC-MS/MS proteomic approach	HRMAS NMR, human epidermis, phthalic anhydride, respiratory sensitizer	Chemical skin and respiratory allergies are becoming a major health problem. To date our knowledge on the process of protein haptenation is still limited and mainly derived from studies performed in solution using model nucleophiles. In order to better understand chemical interactions between chemical allergens and the skin, we have investigated the reactivity of phthalic anhydride 1 (PA), a chemical respiratory sensitizer, toward reconstructed human epidermis (RHE). This study was performed using a new approach combining HRMAS NMR to investigate the in situ chemical reactivity and LC-MS/MS to identify modified epidermal proteins. In RHE, the reaction of PA appeared to be quite fast and the major product formed was phthalic acid. Two amide type adducts on lysine residues were observed and after 8h of incubation, we also observed the formation of an imide type cyclized adducts with lysine. In parallel, RHE samples topically exposed to phthalic anhydride ((13)C)-1 were analyzed using the shotgun proteomics method. Thus, 948 different proteins were extracted and identified, 135 of which being modified by PA, i.e., 14.2% of the extracted proteome. A total of 211 amino acids were modified by PA and validated by fragmentation spectra. We thus identified 154 modified lysines, 22 modified histidines, 30 modified tyrosines, and 5 modified arginines. The rate of modified residues, as a proportion of the total number of modifiable nucleophilic residues in RHE, was rather low (1%). At the protein level, modified proteins were mainly type I and type II keratins and other proteins which are abundant in the epidermis such as protein S100A, Caspase 14, annexin A2, serpin B3, fatty-acid binding protein 5, histone H2, H3, H4, etc. However, the most modified protein, mainly on histidine residues, was filaggrin, a protein that is of low abundance (0.0266 mol %) and rich in histidine.
PXD017722	34370559	Activation of the Type VI Secretion System in the Squid Symbiont Vibrio fischeri Requires the Transcriptional Regulator TasR and the Structural Proteins TssM and TssA. 	A strain-specific genomic island encodes regulatory proteins to activate type VI secretion system expression in the squid symbiont Vibrio fischeri.	1D-LC-MS/MS, Aliivibrio fischeri, Squid-Vibrio symbiosis, Type VI secretion system, Vibrio fischeri, genomic island, symbiosis	Bacteria have evolved diverse strategies to compete for a niche, including the type VI secretion system (T6SS), a contact-dependent killing mechanism. T6SSs are common in bacterial pathogens, commensals, and beneficial symbionts, where they affect the diversity and spatial structure of host-associated microbial communities. Although T6SS gene clusters are often located on genomic islands (GIs), which may be transferred as a unit, the regulatory strategies that promote gene expression once the T6SS genes are transferred into a new cell are not known. We used the squid symbiont Vibrio fischeri to identify essential regulatory factors that control expression of a strain-specific T6SS encoded on a GI. We found that a transcriptional reporter for this T6SS is active only in strains that contain the T6SS-encoding GI, suggesting the GI encodes at least one essential regulator. A transposon screen identified seven mutants that could not activate the reporter. These mutations mapped exclusively to three genes on the T6SS-containing GI that encode two essential structural proteins (a TssA-like protein and TssM) and a transcriptional regulator (TasR). Using T6SS reporters, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), competition assays, and differential proteomics, we found that all three genes are required for expression of many T6SS components, except for the TssA-like protein and TssM, which are constitutively expressed. Based on these findings, we propose a model whereby T6SS expression requires conserved structural proteins, in addition to the essential regulator TasR, and this ability to self-regulate may be a strategy to activate T6SS expression upon transfer of T6SS-encoding elements into a new bacterial host. IMPORTANCE Interbacterial weapons like the T6SS are often located on mobile genetic elements, and their expression is highly regulated. We found that two conserved structural proteins are required for T6SS expression in Vibrio fischeri. These structural proteins also contain predicted GTPase and GTP binding domains, suggesting their role in promoting T6SS expression may involve sensing the energetic state of the cell. Such a mechanism would provide a direct link between T6SS activation and cellular energy levels, providing a "checkpoint" to ensure the cell has sufficient energy to build such a costly weapon. Because these regulatory factors are encoded within the T6SS gene cluster, they are predicted to move with the genetic element to activate T6SS expression in a new host cell.
PXD022914	34371612	Optimization of Protein Isolation and Label-Free Quantitative Proteomic Analysis in Four Different Tissues of Korean Ginseng. 	Optimization of Protein Isolation and Label-free Quantitative Proteomic Analysis in Four Different Tissues of Korean Ginseng	Cytochromes p450, Ginsenosides, Label-free proteomics, MEP pathway, MVA pathway, Methanol/chloroform, Panax ginseng, TCA/acetone, UDP-glycosyltransferase	Korean ginseng is one of the most valuable medicinal plants worldwide. However, our understanding of ginseng proteomics is largely limited due to difficulties in the extraction and resolution of ginseng proteins because of the presence of natural contaminants such as polysaccharides, phenols, and glycosides. Here, we compared four different protein extraction methods, namely, TCA/acetone, TCA/acetone-MeOH/chloroform, phenol-TCA/acetone, and phenol-MeOH/chloroform methods. The TCA/acetone-MeOH/chloroform method displayed the highest extraction efficiency, and thus it was used for the comparative proteome profiling of leaf, root, shoot, and fruit by a label-free quantitative proteomics approach. This approach led to the identification of 2604 significantly modulated proteins among four tissues. We could pinpoint differential pathways and proteins associated with ginsenoside biosynthesis, including the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs), and oxidoreductases (CYP450s). The current study reports an efficient and reproducible method for the isolation of proteins from a wide range of ginseng tissues and provides a detailed organ-based proteome map and a more comprehensive view of enzymatic alterations in ginsenoside biosynthesis.
PXD026014	34372499	Transcriptome and Proteomic Analysis Reveals Up-Regulation of Innate Immunity-Related Genes Expression in Caprine Herpesvirus 1 Infected Madin Darby Bovine Kidney Cells. 	Transcriptome and Proteomic Analysis Reveals Up-Regulation of Innate Immunity Related Genes Expression in Caprine Herpesvirus 1 Infected Madin Darby Bovine Kidney Cells	Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells	Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) is a member of the alpha subfamily of herpesviruses, which is responsible for genital lesions and latent infections in goat populations worldwide. In this study, for the first time, the transcriptome and proteomics of CpHV-1 infected Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were explored using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS) technology, respectively. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 81 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between infected and mock-infected MDBK cells. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that most of these DEGs were mainly involved in the innate immune response, especially the interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis results indicated that the identified DEGs were significantly mainly enriched for response to virus, defense response to virus, response to biotic stimulus and regulation of innate immune response. Viral carcinogenesis, the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and pathways associated with several viral infections were found to be significantly enriched in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database. Eleven selected DEGs (Mx1, RSAD2, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT5, IFIH1, IFITM3, IRF7, IRF9, OAS1X and OAS1Y) associated with immune responses were selected, and they exhibited a concordant direction both in RNA-Seq and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. Proteomic analysis also showed significant up-regulation of innate immunity-related proteins. GO analysis showed that the differentially expressed proteins were mostly enriched in defense response and response to virus, and the pathways associated with viral infection were enriched under KEGG analysis. Protein-protein interaction network analysis indicated most of the DEGs related to innate immune responses, as DDX58(RIG-I), IFIH1(MDA5), IRF7, Mx1, RSAD2, OAS1 and IFIT1, were located in the core of the network and highly connected with other DGEs. Our findings support the notion that CpHV-1 infection induced the transcription and protein expression alterations of a series of genes related to host innate immune response, which helps to elucidate the resistance of host cells to viral infection and to clarify the pathogenesis of CpHV-1.
PXD026348	34372692	Endophytic Streptomyces hygroscopicus OsiSh-2-Mediated Balancing between Growth and Disease Resistance in Host Rice. 	TMT proteomic analysis the interaction mode of endophytic actinobacteria and host rice in against rice blast disease	Defense priming, Disease resistance, Endophytic actinobacteria, Fitness, Proteomic analysis	Plants fine-tune the growth-defense trade-off to survive when facing pathogens. Meanwhile, plant-associated microbes, such as the endophytes inside plant tissues, can benefit plant growth and stress resilience. However, the mechanisms for the beneficial microbes to increase stress resistance with little yield penalty in host plants remain poorly understood. In the present study, we report that endophytic Streptomyces hygroscopicus OsiSh-2 can form a sophisticated interaction with host rice, maintaining cellular homeostasis under pathogen-infection stress, and optimize plant growth and disease resistance in rice. Four-year field trials consistently showed that OsiSh-2 could boost host resistance to rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae while still maintaining a high yield. The integration of the proteomic, physiological, and transcriptional profiling analysis revealed that OsiSh-2 induced rice defense priming and controlled the expression of energy-consuming defense-related proteins, thus increasing the defense capability with the minimized costs of plant immunity. Meanwhile, OsiSh-2 improved the chloroplast development and optimally maintained the expression of proteins related to plant growth under pathogen stress, thus promoting the crop yield. Our results provided a representative example of an endophyte-mediated modulation of disease resistance and fitness in the host plant. The multilayer effects of OsiSh-2 implicate a promising future of using endophytic actinobacteria for disease control and crop yield promotion. IMPORTANCE Under disease stress, activation of defense response in plants often comes with the cost of a reduction in growth and yield, which is referred as the growth-defense trade-off. The microorganisms which can be recruited by plants to mitigate the growth-defense trade-off are of great value in crop breeding. Here, we reported a rice endophytic actinomycetes Streptomyces hygroscopicus OsiSh-2, which can improve host performances on resistance to rice blast while still sustaining high yield in the 4-year field trials. The proteomic, physiological, and transcriptional profiling data offer insights into the molecular basis underlying the balancing between defense and growth in OsiSh-2-rice symbiont. The findings provide an example for the endophyte-mediated modulation of growth-defense trade-offs in plants and indicated the promising application of endophytic actinobacterial strains in agriculture to breed "microbe-optimized crops."
PXD023487	34373319	Targeted in situ cross-linking mass spectrometry and integrative modeling reveal the architectures of three proteins from SARS-CoV-2. 	Targeted in situ cross-linking for determination of structure and interactions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the cellular context	CLMS, HEK293, Mass-Spectrometry, Nsp1, Nsp2, Nucleocapsid protein, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, XLMS	Atomic structures of several proteins from the coronavirus family are still partial or unavailable. A possible reason for this gap is the instability of these proteins outside of the cellular context, thereby prompting the use of in-cell approaches. In situ cross-linking and mass spectrometry (in situ CLMS) can provide information on the structures of such proteins as they occur in the intact cell. Here, we applied targeted in situ CLMS to structurally probe Nsp1, Nsp2, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and obtained cross-link sets with an average density of one cross-link per 20 residues. We then employed integrative modeling that computationally combined the cross-linking data with domain structures to determine full-length atomic models. For the Nsp2, the cross-links report on a complex topology with long-range interactions. Integrative modeling with structural prediction of individual domains by the AlphaFold2 system allowed us to generate a single consistent all-atom model of the full-length Nsp2. The model reveals three putative metal binding sites and suggests a role for Nsp2 in zinc regulation within the replication-transcription complex. For the N protein, we identified multiple intra- and interdomain cross-links. Our integrative model of the N dimer demonstrates that it can accommodate three single RNA strands simultaneously, both stereochemically and electrostatically. For the Nsp1, cross-links with the 40S ribosome were highly consistent with recent cryogenic electron microscopy structures. These results highlight the importance of cellular context for the structural probing of recalcitrant proteins and demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted in situ CLMS and integrative modeling.
PXD019777	34373457	IceR improves proteome coverage and data completeness in global and single-cell proteomics. 	Evaluating the influence of MS-acquisition parameters on DDA label-free proteomics analyses	DDA, DIA, MS1-based, Quantitative proteomics, label-free, missing values	Label-free proteomics by data-dependent acquisition enables the unbiased quantification of thousands of proteins, however it notoriously suffers from high rates of missing values, thus prohibiting consistent protein quantification across large sample cohorts. To solve this, we here present IceR (Ion current extraction Re-quantification), an efficient and user-friendly quantification workflow that combines high identification rates of data-dependent acquisition with low missing value rates similar to data-independent acquisition. Specifically, IceR uses ion current information for a hybrid peptide identification propagation approach with superior quantification precision, accuracy, reliability and data completeness compared to other quantitative workflows. Applied to plasma and single-cell proteomics data, IceR enhanced the number of reliably quantified proteins, improved discriminability between single-cell populations, and allowed reconstruction of a developmental trajectory. IceR will be useful to improve performance of large scale global as well as low-input proteomics applications, facilitated by its availability as an easy-to-use R-package.
PXD023155	34373700	iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis of the hepatoprotective effect of melatonin on ANIT-induced cholestasis in rats. 	An ITRAQ-Based Quantitative Proteomics Analysis of the Hepatoprotective Effect of Melatonin on ANIT-Induced Cholestasis in Rats.	ANIT, cholestasis, iTRAQ, melatonin	The therapeutic effects of melatonin on cholestatic liver injury have received widespread attention recently. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms of the anti-cholestatic effects of melatonin against alpha-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT)-induced liver injury in rats and to screen for potential biomarkers of cholestasis through isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomics. Rats orally received melatonin (100 mg/kg body weight) or an equivalent volume of 0.25% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt 12 h after intraperitoneal injection of ANIT (75 mg/kg) and were subsequently sacrificed at 36 h after injection. Liver biochemical indices were determined and liver tissue samples were stained using hematoxylin-eosin staining, followed by iTRAQ quantitative proteomics to identify potential underlying therapeutic mechanisms and biomarkers. The results suggested that the expression levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin were reduced in the rats treated with melatonin. Histopathological observation indicated that melatonin was effective in the treatment of ANIT-induced cholestasis. iTRAQ proteomics results suggested that melatonin-mediated reduction in ANIT-induced cholestasis may be associated with enhanced antioxidant function and relieving abnormal fatty acid metabolism. According to pathway enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, the major metabolic pathways for the metabolism of melatonin are fatty acid degradation, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway, fatty acid metabolism, chemical carcinogenesis, carbon metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and retinol metabolism, as well as drug metabolism via cytochrome P450. Malate dehydrogenase 1 and glutathione S-transferase Yb-3 may serve as potential targets in the treatment of ANIT-induced cholestasis with melatonin.
PXD039812	34374752	Distinct Mitochondria-Mediated T-Cell Apoptosis Responses in Children and Adults With Coronavirus Disease 2019. 	Human neutrophil proteomics in the presence of pyroptotic macrophage-derived MVs	neutrophil, pyroptosis	BACKGROUND: Lymphopenia is a key feature for adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although it is rarely observed in children. The underlying mechanism remains unclear. METHODS: Immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analyses were used to compare the apoptotic rate of T cells from COVID-19 adults and children and apoptotic responses of adult and child T cells to COVID-19 pooled plasma. Biological properties of caspases and reactive oxygen species were assessed in T cells treated by COVID-19 pooled plasma. RESULTS: Mitochondria apoptosis of peripheral T cells were identified in COVID-19 adult patient samples but not in the children. Furthermore, increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in COVID-19 plasma induced mitochondria apoptosis and caused deoxyribonucleic acid damage by elevating reactive oxygen species levels of the adult T cells. However, the child T cells showed tolerance to mitochondrial apoptosis due to mitochondria autophagy. Activation of autophagy could decrease apoptotic sensitivity of the adult T cells to plasma from COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was activated in T cells of COVID-19 adult patients specifically, which may shed light on the pathophysiological difference between adults and children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 ).
PXD027234	34375526	Cross-Linking/Mass Spectrometry Combined with Ion Mobility on a timsTOF Pro Instrument for Structural Proteomics. 	Cross-linking/Mass Spectrometry Combined with Ion Mobility on a timsTOF Pro Instrument for Structural Proteomics	Chemical Cross-Linking, Ion Mobility, Protein 3D-Structure, Protein Interaction Networks	The combination of cross-linking/mass spectrometry (XL-MS) and ion mobility is still underexplored for conducting protein conformational and protein-protein interaction studies. We present a method for analyzing cross-linking mixtures on a timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer that allows separating ions based on their gas-phase mobilities. Cross-linking was performed with three urea-based MS-cleavable cross-linkers that deliver distinct fragmentation patterns for cross-linked species upon collisional activation. The discrimination of cross-linked species from non-cross-linked peptides was readily performed based on their collisional cross sections. We demonstrate the general feasibility of our combined XL-MS/ion mobility approach for three protein systems of increasing complexity: (i) bovine serum albumin (BSA), (ii) Escherichia coli ribosome, and (iii) HEK293T cell nuclear lysates. We identified a total of 623 unique cross-linking sites for BSA, 670 for the E. coli ribosome, and 1623 unique cross-links for nuclear lysates, corresponding to 1088 intra- and 535 interprotein interactions and yielding 564 distinct protein-protein interactions. Our results underline the strength of combining XL-MS with ion mobility not only for deriving three-dimensional (3D) structures of single proteins but also for performing system-wide protein interaction studies.
PXD027214	34375584	A composite DNA element that functions as a maintainer required for epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin. 	A Composite DNA Element that Functions as a Maintainer Required for Epigenetic Inheritance of Heterochromatin	H3K9me, Heterochromatin, Maintainer, methylation  pombe	Epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin requires DNA-sequence-independent propagation mechanisms, coupling to RNAi, or input from DNA sequence, but how DNA contributes to inheritance is not understood. Here, we identify a DNA element (termed "maintainer") that is sufficient for epigenetic inheritance of pre-existing histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) and heterochromatin in Schizosaccharomyces pombe but cannot establish de novo gene silencing in wild-type cells. This maintainer is a composite DNA element with binding sites for the Atf1/Pcr1 and Deb1 transcription factors and the origin recognition complex (ORC), located within a 130-bp region, and can be converted to a silencer in cells with lower rates of H3K9me turnover, suggesting that it participates in recruiting the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4/Suv39h. These results suggest that, in the absence of RNAi, histone H3K9me is only heritable when it can collaborate with maintainer-associated DNA-binding proteins that help recruit the enzyme responsible for its epigenetic deposition.
PXD020515	34376225	Ref-1 redox activity alters cancer cell metabolism in pancreatic cancer: exploiting this novel finding as a potential target. 	Proteomic changes following knockdown of DNA repair and redox signaling protein, APE1/Ref-1, under hypoxia conditions	APE1/Ref-1, DNA repair, Pancreatic cancer, hypoxia, transcription factor signaling	BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is a complex disease with a desmoplastic stroma, extreme hypoxia, and inherent resistance to therapy. Understanding the signaling and adaptive response of such an aggressive cancer is key to making advances in therapeutic efficacy. Redox factor-1 (Ref-1), a redox signaling protein, regulates the conversion of several transcription factors (TFs), including HIF-1alpha, STAT3 and NFkappaB from an oxidized to reduced state leading to enhancement of their DNA binding. In our previously published work, knockdown of Ref-1 under normoxia resulted in altered gene expression patterns on pathways including EIF2, protein kinase A, and mTOR. In this study, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and proteomics were used to explore the effects of Ref-1 on metabolic pathways under hypoxia. METHODS: scRNA-seq comparing pancreatic cancer cells expressing less than 20% of the Ref-1 protein was analyzed using left truncated mixture Gaussian model and validated using proteomics and qRT-PCR. The identified Ref-1's role in mitochondrial function was confirmed using mitochondrial function assays, qRT-PCR, western blotting and NADP assay. Further, the effect of Ref-1 redox function inhibition against pancreatic cancer metabolism was assayed using 3D co-culture in vitro and xenograft studies in vivo. RESULTS: Distinct transcriptional variation in central metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, immune response, and genes downstream of a series of signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory factors were identified in Ref-1 knockdown vs Scrambled control from the scRNA-seq data. Mitochondrial DEG subsets downregulated with Ref-1 knockdown were significantly reduced following Ref-1 redox inhibition and more dramatically in combination with Devimistat in vitro. Mitochondrial function assays demonstrated that Ref-1 knockdown and Ref-1 redox signaling inhibition decreased utilization of TCA cycle substrates and slowed the growth of pancreatic cancer co-culture spheroids. In Ref-1 knockdown cells, a higher flux rate of NADP + consuming reactions was observed suggesting the less availability of NADP + and a higher level of oxidative stress in these cells. In vivo xenograft studies demonstrated that tumor reduction was potent with Ref-1 redox inhibitor similar to Devimistat. CONCLUSION: Ref-1 redox signaling inhibition conclusively alters cancer cell metabolism by causing TCA cycle dysfunction while also reducing the pancreatic tumor growth in vitro as well as in vivo.
PXD020629	34376243	Decoding distinctive features of plasma extracellular vesicles in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 	Distinct features of plasma extracellular vesicles in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients	Plasma extracellular vesicles and ALS	BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multifactorial, multisystem motor neuron disease for which currently there is no effective treatment. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers to tackle the disease's complexity and help in early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanostructures released by any cell type into body fluids. Their biophysical and biochemical characteristics vary with the parent cell's physiological and pathological state and make them an attractive source of multidimensional data for patient classification and stratification. METHODS: We analyzed plasma-derived EVs of ALS patients (n = 106) and controls (n = 96), and SOD1(G93A) and TDP-43(Q331K) mouse models of ALS. We purified plasma EVs by nickel-based isolation, characterized their EV size distribution and morphology respectively by nanotracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy, and analyzed EV markers and protein cargos by Western blot and proteomics. We used machine learning techniques to predict diagnosis and prognosis. RESULTS: Our procedure resulted in high-yield isolation of intact and polydisperse plasma EVs, with minimal lipoprotein contamination. EVs in the plasma of ALS patients and the two mouse models of ALS had a distinctive size distribution and lower HSP90 levels compared to the controls. In terms of disease progression, the levels of cyclophilin A with the EV size distribution distinguished fast and slow disease progressors, a possibly new means for patient stratification. Immuno-electron microscopy also suggested that phosphorylated TDP-43 is not an intravesicular cargo of plasma-derived EVs. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis unmasked features in plasma EVs of ALS patients with potential straightforward clinical application. We conceived an innovative mathematical model based on machine learning which, by integrating EV size distribution data with protein cargoes, gave very high prediction rates for disease diagnosis and prognosis.
PXD027493	34376696	NEK1-mediated retromer trafficking promotes blood-brain barrier integrity by regulating glucose metabolism and RIPK1 activation. 	Comparing the plasma membrane proteins of Nek1+/+ and Nek1Kat2J/Kat2J MEFs	Nek1, Plasma membrane proteins, retromer	Loss-of-function mutations in NEK1 gene, which encodes a serine/threonine kinase, are involved in human developmental disorders and ALS. Here we show that NEK1 regulates retromer-mediated endosomal trafficking by phosphorylating VPS26B. NEK1 deficiency disrupts endosomal trafficking of plasma membrane proteins and cerebral proteome homeostasis to promote mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction and aggregation of alpha-synuclein. The metabolic and proteomic defects of NEK1 deficiency disrupts the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB) by promoting lysosomal degradation of A20, a key modulator of RIPK1, thus sensitizing cerebrovascular endothelial cells to RIPK1-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis. Genetic inactivation of RIPK1 or metabolic rescue with ketogenic diet can prevent postnatal lethality and BBB damage in NEK1 deficient mice. Inhibition of RIPK1 reduces neuroinflammation and aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the brains of NEK1 deficient mice. Our study identifies a molecular mechanism by which retromer trafficking and metabolism regulates cerebrovascular integrity, cerebral proteome homeostasis and RIPK1-mediated neuroinflammation.
PXD027901	34378239	Pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial soluble adenylyl cyclase in astrocytes causes activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and induces breakdown of glycogen. 	Pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial soluble adenylyl cyclase in astrocytes causes activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and induces breakdown of glycogen	AMP-activated protein kinase, Mouse Astrocytes, Phosphorylation, adenylyl cyclase, energy metabolism	Mobilization of astrocyte glycogen is key for processes such as synaptic plasticity and memory formation but the link between neuronal activity and glycogen breakdown is not fully known. Activation of cytosolic soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) in astrocytes has been suggested to link neuronal depolarization and glycogen breakdown partly based on experiments employing pharmacological inhibition of sAC. However, several studies have revealed that sAC located within mitochondria is a central regulator of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, pharmacological sAC inhibition is likely to affect both cytosolic and mitochondrial sAC and if bioenergetic readouts are studied, the observed effects are likely to stem from inhibition of mitochondrial rather than cytosolic sAC. Here, we report that a pharmacologically induced inhibition of sAC activity lowers mitochondrial respiration, induces phosphorylation of the metabolic master switch AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and decreases glycogen stores in cultured primary murine astrocytes. From these data and our discussion of the literature, mitochondrial sAC emerges as a key regulator of astrocyte bioenergetics. Lastly, we discuss the challenges of investigating the functional and metabolic roles of cytosolic versus mitochondrial sAC in astrocytes employing the currently available pharmacological tool compounds.
PXD026848	34379420	A Multi-omics Longitudinal Study Reveals Alteration of the Leukocyte Activation Pathway in COVID-19 Patients. 	Validation of proteins showing significant dysregulation from shotgun proteomics experiments in longitudinal plasma samples of COVID-19 patients	COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, longitudinal, mass-spectrometry, metabolomics	Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection may lead to lung injury, multi-organ failure, and eventually death. Cytokine storm due to excess cytokine production has been associated with fatality in severe infections. However, the specific molecular signatures associated with the elevated immune response are yet to be elucidated. We performed a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and metabolomic analysis of COVID-19 plasma samples collected at two time points. Using Orbitrap Fusion LC-MS/MS-based label-free proteomic analysis, we identified around 10 significant proteins, 32 significant peptides, and 5 metabolites that were dysregulated at the severe time points. Few of these proteins identified by quantitative proteomics were validated using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assay. Integrated pathway analysis using distinct proteomic and metabolomic signatures revealed alterations in complement and coagulation cascade, platelet aggregation, myeloid leukocyte activation pathway, and arginine metabolism. Further, we highlight the role of leukocyte activation and arginine metabolism in COVID-19 pathogenesis and targeting these pathways for COVID-19 therapeutics.
PXD024259	34379783	Transcriptional silencing of fetal hemoglobin expression by NonO. 	SOX6 interacting proteins' identification in K562 cells for the regulation of gamma-globin gene expression research	Globin, K562, SOX6, gene expression	Human fetal globin (gamma-globin) genes are developmentally silenced after birth, and reactivation of gamma-globin expression in adulthood ameliorates symptoms of hemoglobin disorders, such as sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta-thalassemia. However, the mechanisms by which gamma-globin expression is precisely regulated are still incompletely understood. Here, we found that NonO (non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein) interacted directly with SOX6, and repressed the expression of gamma-globin gene in human erythroid cells. We showed that NonO bound to the octamer binding motif, ATGCAAAT, of the gamma-globin proximal promoter, resulting in inhibition of gamma-globin transcription. Depletion of NonO resulted in significant activation of gamma-globin expression in K562, HUDEP-2, and primary human erythroid progenitor cells. To confirm the role of NonO in vivo, we further generated a conditional knockout of NonO by using IFN-inducible Mx1-Cre transgenic mice. We found that induced NonO deletion reactivated murine embryonic globin and human gamma-globin gene expression in adult beta-YAC mice, suggesting a conserved role for NonO during mammalian evolution. Thus, our data indicate that NonO acts as a novel transcriptional repressor of gamma-globin gene expression through direct promoter binding, and is essential for gamma-globin gene silencing.
PXD024846	34379872	Hepatitis C virus treatment with direct-acting antivirals induces rapid changes in the hepatic proteome. 	Antiviral HCV Treatment Induces Rapid Proteomic and Phospho-proteomic Changes in Hepatic Interferon and ERK1/2 Signaling Pathways	DAA, HCV, Phosphoproteomics, liver biopsy	Treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus with direct-acting antivirals usually eradicates infection, but liver fibrosis does not resolve concurrently. In patients who develop cirrhosis prior to hepatitis C virus treatment, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma can still occur after viral elimination due to residual fibrosis. We hypothesized the liver proteome would exhibit meaningful changes in inflammatory and fibrinogenic pathways change upon hepatitis C virus eradication, which could impact subsequent fibrosis regression. We analysed the liver proteome and phosphoproteome of paired liver biopsies obtained from 8 hepatitis C virus-infected patients before or immediately after treatment with direct-acting antivirals. Proteins in interferon signalling and antiviral pathways decreased concurrent with hepatitis C virus treatment, consistent with prior transcriptomic analyses. Expression of extracellular matrix proteins associated with liver fibrosis did not change with treatment, but the phosphorylation pattern of proteins present within signalling pathways implicated in hepatic fibrinogenesis, including the ERK1/2 pathway, was altered concurrent with hepatitis C virus treatment. Hepatitis C virus treatment leads to reduced expression of hepatic proteins involved in interferon and antiviral signalling. Additionally, changes in fibrosis signalling pathways are detectable before alteration in extracellular matrix proteins, identifying a putative chronology for the dynamic processes involved in fibrosis reversal.
PXD018040	34380038	Actinin BioID reveals sarcomere crosstalk with oxidative metabolism through interactions with IGF2BP2. 	Identifying dynamic protein and RNA proximity interaction networks of actinin reveals RNA-binding and metabolic regulatory mechanisms	Actinin, cardiomyocytes, quantitative proteomics	Actinins are strain-sensing actin cross-linkers that are ubiquitously expressed and harbor mutations in human diseases. We utilize CRISPR, pluripotent stem cells, and BioID to study actinin interactomes in human cardiomyocytes. We identify 324 actinin proximity partners, including those that are dependent on sarcomere assembly. We confirm 19 known interactors and identify a network of RNA-binding proteins, including those with RNA localization functions. In vivo and biochemical interaction studies support that IGF2BP2 localizes electron transport chain transcripts to actinin neighborhoods through interactions between its K homology (KH) domain and actinin's rod domain. We combine alanine scanning mutagenesis and metabolic assays to disrupt and functionally interrogate actinin-IGF2BP2 interactions, which reveal an essential role in metabolic responses to pathological sarcomere activation using a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy model. This study expands our functional knowledge of actinin, uncovers sarcomere interaction partners, and reveals sarcomere crosstalk with IGF2BP2 for metabolic adaptation relevant to human disease.
PXD025680	34380568	Proteomics informed by transcriptomics for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the sialoproteome of adult Ornithodoros moubata ticks. 	Proteomics informed by transcriptomics for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the sialoproteome of Ornithodoros moubata adult ticks. SWATH Label Free quantitation	DIA, LC MSMS, Label free quantitaion, Ornithodoros moubata proteome, SWATH	BACKGROUND: The argasid tick Ornithodoros moubata is the main vector in mainland Africa of African swine fever virus and the spirochete Borrelia duttoni, which causes human relapsing fever. The elimination of populations of O. moubata would contribute to the prevention and control of these two serious diseases. Anti-tick vaccines are an eco-friendly and sustainable means of eliminating tick populations. Tick saliva forms part of the tick-host interface, and knowledge of its composition is key to the identification and selection of vaccine candidate antigens. The aim of the present work is to increase the body of data on the composition of the saliva proteome of adult O. moubata ticks, particularly of females, since in-depth knowledge of the O. moubata sialome will allow the identification and selection of novel salivary antigens as targets for tick vaccines. METHODS: We analysed samples of female and male saliva using two different mass spectrometry (MS) approaches: data-dependent acquisition liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) and sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra-MS (SWATH-MS). To maximise the number of proteins identified, a proteomics informed by transcriptomics analysis was applied using the O. moubata salivary transcriptomic dataset previously obtained by RNA-Seq. RESULTS: SWATH-MS proved to be superior to LC-MS/MS for the study of female saliva, since it identified 61.2% more proteins than the latter, the reproducibility of results was enhanced with its use, and it provided a quantitative picture of salivary components. In total, we identified 299 non-redundant proteins in the saliva of O. moubata, and quantified the expression of 165 of these in both male and female saliva, among which 13 were significantly overexpressed in females and 40 in males. These results indicate important quantitative differences in the saliva proteome between the sexes. CONCLUSIONS: This work expands our knowledge of the O. moubata sialome, particularly that of females, by increasing the number of identified novel salivary proteins, which have different functions at the tick-host feeding interface. This new knowledge taken together with information on the O. moubata sialotranscriptome will allow a more rational selection of salivary candidates as antigen targets for tick vaccine development.
PXD027131	34380642	Kinobead Profiling Reveals Reprogramming of BCR Signaling in Response to Therapy within Primary CLL Cells. 	Kinome profiling of primary CLL cells	BCR signalling, Kinome	PURPOSE: B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is critical for the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), promoting both malignant cell survival and disease progression. Although vital, understanding of the wider signaling network associated with malignant BCR stimulation is poor. This is relevant with respect to potential changes in response to therapy, particularly involving kinase inhibitors. In the current study, we describe a novel high-resolution approach to investigate BCR signaling in primary CLL cells and track the influence of therapy on signaling response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A kinobead/mass spectrometry-based protocol was used to study BCR signaling in primary CLL cells. Longitudinal analysis of samples donated by clinical trial patients was used to investigate the impact of chemoimmunotherapy and ibrutinib on signaling following surface IgM engagement. Complementary Nanostring and immunoblotting analysis was used to verify our findings. RESULTS: Our protocol isolated a unique, patient-specific signature of over 30 kinases from BCR-stimulated CLL cells. This signature was associated with 13 distinct Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and showed significant change in cells from treatment-naive patients compared with those from patients who had previously undergone therapy. This change was validated by longitudinal analysis of clinical trials samples where BCR-induced kinome responses in CLL cells altered between baseline and disease progression in patients failing chemoimmunotherapy and between baseline and treatment in patients taking ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: These data comprise the first comprehensive proteomic investigation of the BCR signaling response within CLL cells and reveal unique evidence that these cells undergo adaptive reprogramming of this signaling in response to therapy.
PXD025164	34381043	Temporal omics analysis in Syrian hamsters unravel cellular effector responses to moderate COVID-19. 	Temporal omics analysis in Syrian hamsters unravel cellular effector responses to moderate COVID-19	Covid-19, Mesocricetus auratus, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, Sars-Cov-2	In COVID-19, immune responses are key in determining disease severity. However, cellular mechanisms at the onset of inflammatory lung injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly involving endothelial cells, remain ill-defined. Using Syrian hamsters as a model for moderate COVID-19, we conduct a detailed longitudinal analysis of systemic and pulmonary cellular responses, and corroborate it with datasets from COVID-19 patients. Monocyte-derived macrophages in lungs exert the earliest and strongest transcriptional response to infection, including induction of pro-inflammatory genes, while epithelial cells show weak alterations. Without evidence for productive infection, endothelial cells react, depending on cell subtypes, by strong and early expression of anti-viral, pro-inflammatory, and T cell recruiting genes. Recruitment of cytotoxic T cells as well as emergence of IgM antibodies precede viral clearance at day 5 post infection. Investigating SARS-CoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters thus identifies cell type-specific effector functions, providing detailed insights into pathomechanisms of COVID-19 and informing therapeutic strategies.
PXD022335	34381044	Cell-type and subcellular compartment-specific APEX2 proximity labeling reveals activity-dependent nuclear proteome dynamics in the striatum. 	Cell-type and subcellular compartment-specific APEX2 proximity labeling reveals activity-dependent nuclear proteome dynamics in the striatum	APEX2, neurproteomics, proximity labeling, striatum	The vertebrate brain consists of diverse neuronal types, classified by distinct anatomy and function, along with divergent transcriptomes and proteomes. Defining the cell-type specific neuroproteomes is important for understanding the development and functional organization of neural circuits. This task remains challenging in complex tissue, due to suboptimal protein isolation techniques that often result in loss of cell-type specific information and incomplete capture of subcellular compartments. Here, we develop a genetically targeted proximity labeling approach to identify cell-type specific subcellular proteomes in the mouse brain, confirmed by imaging, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry. We virally express subcellular-localized APEX2 to map the proteome of direct and indirect pathway spiny projection neurons in the striatum. The workflow provides sufficient depth to uncover changes in the proteome of striatal neurons following chemogenetic activation of Galphaq-coupled signaling cascades. This method enables flexible, cell-type specific quantitative profiling of subcellular proteome snapshots in the mouse brain.
PXD027039	34381146	Effects of secretome derived from macrophages exposed to calcium oxalate crystals on renal fibroblast activation. 	Effects of secretome derived from macrophages exposed to calcium oxalate crystals on renal fibroblast activation	Calcium oxalate, Kidney stone, Macrophage, Renal fibrosis, Secretome	The association between kidney stone disease and renal fibrosis has been widely explored in recent years but its underlying mechanisms remain far from complete understanding. Using label-free quantitative proteomics (nanoLC-ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap MS/MS), this study identified 23 significantly altered secreted proteins from calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM)-exposed macrophages (COM-MP) compared with control macrophages (Ctrl-MP) secretome. Functional annotation and protein-protein interactions network analysis revealed that these altered secreted proteins were involved mainly in inflammatory response and fibroblast activation. BHK-21 renal fibroblasts treated with COM-MP secretome had more spindle-shaped morphology with greater spindle index. Immunofluorescence study and gelatin zymography revealed increased levels of fibroblast activation markers (alpha-smooth muscle actin and F-actin) and fibrotic factors (fibronectin and matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2) in the COM-MP secretome-treated fibroblasts. Our findings indicate that proteins secreted from macrophages exposed to COM crystals induce renal fibroblast activation and may play important roles in renal fibrogenesis in kidney stone disease.
PXD027071	34381153	Gastrobodies are engineered antibody mimetics resilient to pepsin and hydrochloric acid. 	Gastrobodies are engineered antibody mimetics resilient to pepsin and hydrochloric acid	SBTI, gastrobody, protease	Protein-based targeting reagents, such as antibodies and non-antibody scaffold proteins, are rapidly inactivated in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Hydrochloric acid in gastric juice denatures proteins and activates pepsin, concentrations of which reach 1 mg/mL in the mammalian stomach. Two stable scaffold proteins (nanobody and nanofitin), previously developed to be protease-resistant, were completely digested in less than 10 min at 100-fold lower concentration of pepsin than found in the stomach. Here we present gastrobodies, a protein scaffold derived from Kunitz soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI). SBTI is highly resistant to the challenges of the upper GI tract, including digestive proteases, pH 2 and bile acids. Computational prediction of SBTI's evolvability identified two nearby loops for randomization, to create a potential recognition surface which was experimentally validated by alanine scanning. We established display of SBTI on full-length pIII of M13 phage. Phage selection of gastrobody libraries against the glucosyltransferase domain of Clostridium difficile toxin B (GTD) identified hits with nanomolar affinity and enzyme inhibitory activity. Anti-GTD binders retained high stability to acid, digestive proteases and heat. Gastrobodies show resilience to exceptionally harsh conditions, which should provide a foundation for targeting and modulating function within the GI tract.
PXD022232	34381419	The Inclusion Principles of Human Embryos in the WOW-Based Time-Lapse System: A Retrospective Cohort Study. 	The secretory proteins produced by the embryos with different quality.	Pear, embryo group culture, melatonin, secretome of embryos	A time-lapse system (TLS) with a well-of-the-well (WOW) dish, which allows individual identification and the possibility of autocrine and paracrine signaling between group-cultured embryos, has been widely used in clinic. However, there is a need to re-think the inclusion principles of human embryos in WOW-based TLS, especially for grade IV (G4) embryos, which are considered to potentially have detrimental effects on surrounding embryos. Here, we carried out a single-center, large-cohort, retrospective study, comprising 303 patients undergoing IVF (148 cases) and ICSI (155 cases), with a total of 3282 embryos, to compare embryonic development until the blastocyst stage in the group culture system with or without G4 embryos. Further, LC-MS/MS was used to analyze the G1-G4 embryo secretome to understand the influence of G4 embryos on the group culture microenvironment. We proved that polypronuclear (PPN) embryos positively contribute to the development of the neighboring embryos through secretion of ILIAP, ITI-H4, and keratin. Existence of more than one G4 embryo had a negative effect on the other embryos (p < 0.05). Moreover, G4 embryos were found to secrete KLKB1 and VTDB, which might harm the neighboring embryos. Thus, our study clarified that when embryos are subjected to group culture in WOW-based TLS, the PPN-derived embryos need not be removed, and it is important to ensure that no more than one G4 embryo is present to avoid negative effects on the neighboring embryos.
PXD023033	34381737	Mass Spectrometry Proteotyping-Based Detection and Identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans in Blood. 	Mass Spectrometry Proteotyping-Based Detection and Identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans in Blood	Bloodstream infections, Pathogen Identification, Proteotyping	Bloodstream infections (BSIs), the presence of microorganisms in blood, are potentially serious conditions that can quickly develop into sepsis and life-threatening situations. When assessing proper treatment, rapid diagnosis is the key; besides clinical judgement performed by attending physicians, supporting microbiological tests typically are performed, often requiring microbial isolation and culturing steps, which increases the time required for confirming positive cases of BSI. The additional waiting time forces physicians to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics and empirically based treatments, before determining the precise cause of the disease. Thus, alternative and more rapid cultivation-independent methods are needed to improve clinical diagnostics, supporting prompt and accurate treatment and reducing the development of antibiotic resistance. In this study, a culture-independent workflow for pathogen detection and identification in blood samples was developed, using peptide biomarkers and applying bottom-up proteomics analyses, i.e., so-called "proteotyping". To demonstrate the feasibility of detection of blood infectious pathogens, using proteotyping, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were included in the study, as the most prominent bacterial causes of bacteremia and sepsis, as well as Candida albicans, one of the most prominent causes of fungemia. Model systems including spiked negative blood samples, as well as positive blood cultures, without further culturing steps, were investigated. Furthermore, an experiment designed to determine the incubation time needed for correct identification of the infectious pathogens in blood cultures was performed. The results for the spiked negative blood samples showed that proteotyping was 100- to 1,000-fold more sensitive, in comparison with the MALDI-TOF MS-based approach. Furthermore, in the analyses of ten positive blood cultures each of E. coli and S. aureus, both the MALDI-TOF MS-based and proteotyping approaches were successful in the identification of E. coli, although only proteotyping could identify S. aureus correctly in all samples. Compared with the MALDI-TOF MS-based approaches, shotgun proteotyping demonstrated higher sensitivity and accuracy, and required significantly shorter incubation time before detection and identification of the correct pathogen could be accomplished.
PXD025158	34381774	Mapping Microproteins and ncRNA-Encoded Polypeptides in Different Mouse Tissues. 	Mapping microproteins and ncRNA-encoded polypeptides in different mouse tissues	Small open reading frame, microprotein, ncRNAs, polypeptides, tissue	Small open reading frame encoded peptides (SEPs), also called microproteins, play a vital role in biological processes. Plenty of their open reading frames are located within the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) range. Recent research has demonstrated that ncRNA-encoded polypeptides have essential functions and exist ubiquitously in various tissues. To better understand the role of microproteins, especially ncRNA-encoded proteins, expressed in different tissues, we profiled the proteomic characterization of five mouse tissues by mass spectrometry, including bottom-up, top-down, and de novo sequencing strategies. Bottom-up and top-down with database-dependent searches identified 811 microproteins in the OpenProt database. De novo sequencing identified 290 microproteins, including 12 ncRNA-encoded microproteins that were not found in current databases. In this study, we discovered 1,074 microproteins in total, including 270 ncRNA-encoded microproteins. From the annotation of these microproteins, we found that the brain contains the largest number of neuropeptides, while the spleen contains the most immunoassociated microproteins. This suggests that microproteins in different tissues have tissue-specific functions. These unannotated ncRNA-coded microproteins have predicted domains, such as the macrophage migration inhibitory factor domain and the Prefoldin domain. These results expand the mouse proteome and provide insight into the molecular biology of mouse tissues.
PXD025773	34381778	Emodin Prevented Depression in Chronic Unpredicted Mild Stress-Exposed Rats by Targeting miR-139-5p/5-Lipoxygenase. 	Proteomic response of rat hippocampus under chronic unpredicted mild stress reveals insights into susceptibility and insensitivity to depression	chronic unpredicted mild stress, depression, hippocampus	BACKGROUND: The use of medicinal plant ingredients is one of the goals of developing potential drugs for treating depression. Compelling evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory medicines may block the occurrence of depression. We studied the effect of a natural compound, emodin, on the development of psychosocial stress-induced depression and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) for 7 weeks was performed to replicate psychosocial stress in rats. The sucrose preference test, force swimming test, and open field test were used to evaluate their behaviors. The differentially expressed proteins in the hippocampus were analyzed using proteomics. Nissl staining and Golgi staining were used to detect the loss of neurons and synapses, immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the activation of microglia, and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were also performed. RESULTS: Hippocampal inflammation with up-regulated 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) was observed in the depressed rats after CUMS exposure. The upregulation of 5-LO was caused by decreased miR-139-5p. To observe the effect of emodin, we screened out depression-susceptible (DeS) rats during CUMS and treated them with emodin (80 mg/kg/day). Two weeks later, emodin prevented the depression behaviors in DeS rats along with a series of pathological changes in their hippocampi, such as loss of neurons and spines, microglial activation, increased interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and the activation of 5-LO. Furthermore, we demonstrated that emodin inhibited its excess inflammatory response, possibly by targeting miR-139-5p/5-LO and modulating glycogen synthase kinase 3beta and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. CONCLUSION: These results provide important evidence that emodin may be a candidate agent for the treatment of depression and established a key role of miR-139-5p/5-LO in the inflammation of depression.
PXD024766	34382403	Identification and Quantification of Glutathionylated Cysteines under Ischemic Stress. 	Site-specific Identification and Quantification of Protein Glutathionylation under Ischemic Stress	Cardiomyocytes, Click chemistry, Gutathionylation	Ischemia reperfusion injury contributes to adverse cardiovascular diseases in part by producing a burst of reactive oxygen species that induce oxidations of many muscular proteins. Glutathionylation is one of the major protein cysteine oxidations that often serve as molecular mechanisms behind the pathophysiology associated with ischemic stress. Despite the biological significance of glutathionylation in ischemia reperfusion, identification of specific glutathionylated cysteines under ischemic stress has been limited. In this report, we have analyzed glutathionylation under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or repletion of nutrients after OGD (OGD/R) by using a clickable glutathione approach that specifically detects glutathionylated proteins. Our data find that palmitate availability induces a global level of glutathionylation and decreases cell viability during OGD/R. We have then applied a clickable glutathione-based proteomic quantification strategy, which enabled the identification and quantification of 249 glutathionylated cysteines in response to palmitate during OGD/R in the HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell line. The subsequent bioinformatic analysis found 18 glutathionylated cysteines whose genetic variants are associated with muscular disorders. Overall, our data report glutathionylated cysteines under ischemic stress that may contribute to adverse outcomes or muscular disorders.
PXD022833	34382793	Discovering the N-Terminal Methylome by Repurposing of Proteomic Datasets. 	Discovering the N-terminal Methylome by the Repurposing of Proteomic Datasets	post-translational modification, repurposing, âº-N-terminal methylation	Protein alpha-N-methylation is an underexplored post-translational modification involving the covalent addition of methyl groups to the free alpha-amino group at protein N-termini. To systematically explore the extent of alpha-N-terminal methylation in yeast and humans, we reanalyzed publicly accessible proteomic datasets to identify N-terminal peptides contributing to the alpha-N-terminal methylome. This repurposing approach found evidence of alpha-N-methylation of established and novel protein substrates with canonical N-terminal motifs of established alpha-N-terminal methyltransferases, including human NTMT1/2 and yeast Tae1. NTMT1/2 are implicated in cancer and aging processes but have unclear and context-dependent roles. Moreover, alpha-N-methylation of noncanonical sequences was surprisingly prevalent, suggesting unappreciated and cryptic methylation events. Analysis of the amino acid frequencies of alpha-N-methylated peptides revealed a [S]1-[S/A/Q]2 pattern in yeast and [A/N/G]1-[A/S/V]2-[A/G]3 in humans, which differs from the canonical motif. We delineated the distribution of the two types of prevalent N-terminal modifications, acetylation and methylation, on amino acids at the first position. We tested three potentially methylated proteins and confirmed the alpha-N-terminal methylation of Hsp31 by additional proteomic analysis and immunoblotting. The other two proteins, Vma1 and Ssa3, were found to be predominantly acetylated, indicating that proteomic searching for alpha-N-terminal methylation requires careful consideration of mass spectra. This study demonstrates the feasibility of reprocessing proteomic data for global alpha-N-terminal methylome investigations.
PXD018782	34383057	Multimodal platform for assessing drug distribution and response in clinical trials. 	Phosphoproteomic analysis in Glioblastoma in response to AZD1775	AZD1775, Glioblastoma, Phosphoproteomics	BACKGROUND: Response to targeted therapy varies between patients for largely unknown reasons. Here, we developed and applied an integrative platform using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), phosphoproteomics, and multiplexed tissue imaging for mapping drug distribution, target engagement, and adaptive response to gain insights into heterogeneous response to therapy. METHODS: Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines of glioblastoma were treated with adavosertib, a Wee1 inhibitor, and tissue drug distribution was measured with MALDI-MSI. Phosphoproteomics was measured in the same tumors to identify biomarkers of drug target engagement and cellular adaptive response. Multiplexed tissue imaging was performed on sister sections to evaluate spatial co-localization of drug and cellular response. The integrated platform was then applied on clinical specimens from glioblastoma patients enrolled in the phase 1 clinical trial. RESULTS: PDX tumors exposed to different doses of adavosertib revealed intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity of drug distribution and integration of the heterogeneous drug distribution with phosphoproteomics and multiplexed tissue imaging revealed new markers of molecular response to adavosertib. Analysis of paired clinical specimens from patients enrolled in the phase 1 clinical trial informed the translational potential of the identified biomarkers in studying patient's response to adavosertib. CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal platform identified a signature of drug efficacy and patient-specific adaptive responses applicable to preclinical and clinical drug development. The information generated by the approach may inform mechanisms of success and failure in future early phase clinical trials, providing information for optimizing clinical trial design and guiding future application into clinical practice.
PXD021776	34383630	Cerebrospinal fluid proteomics reveal potential protein targets of JiaWeiSiNiSan in preventing chronic psychological stress damage. 	Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomics of Rats with Depression	cerebrospinal fluid, depression	CONTEXT: Chinese herbal formula JiaWeiSiNiSan (JWSNS) has been widely used to prevent stress-induced neuropsychiatric ailments in clinics and proven to have therapeutic anti-stress effects on rats. However, the mechanism remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: Based on the proteomics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), this study explores the possible mechanism and target proteins of JiaWeiSiNiSan raising stress resilience and preventing stress damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 6-week Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS) model was applied on adult Wistar male rats to observe the effects of JWSNS on improving mental stress resilience. Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomics and bioinformatics analysis were used to screen and analyze differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in CSF. Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) was used to validate target DEPs. RESULTS: Significantly decreased sucrose preference, locomotion activity level and accuracy of T-maze, as well as increased immobility time, were observed in CUMS rats compared to CON rats while JWSNS improved above depression-like behaviours. The quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics analysis showed that JWSNS decreased the expression of Rps4x, HSP90AA1, Rps12, Uba1, Rsp14, Tuba1b in CUMS rats CSF (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.5). Immunofluorescence results showed that the number of BrdU/DCX positive cells (p < 0.01) and the relative number of neurons (p < 0.01) in the hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) of the JSWNS group significantly increased, compared with the CUMS group. CONCLUSIONS: JWSNS could increase mental stress resilience and prevent stress damage by regulating proteins in CSF. This study provides a scientific basis for further study on Chinese formulas preventing mental illness.
PXD023388	34383828	Integration of chronological omics data reveals mitochondrial regulatory mechanisms during the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. 	Chronological mitochondrial proteomics of chemically induced hepatocellular carcinoma in rat	chronological study, hepatocellular carcinoma, mitochondria, omics integration, rat, shotgun proteomics	Mitochondria participate in multiple functions in eukaryotic cells. Although disruption of mitochondrial function has been associated with energetic deregulation in cancer, the chronological changes in mitochondria during cancer development remain unclear. With the aim to assess the role of mitochondria throughout cancer development, we analyzed samples chronologically obtained from induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in rats. In our analyses, we integrated mitochondrial proteomic data, mitochondrial metabolomic data and nuclear genome transcriptomic data. We used pathway over-representation and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to integrate expression profiles of genes, miRNAs, proteins and metabolite levels throughout HCC development. Our results show that mitochondria are dynamic organelles presenting specific modifications in different stages of HCC development. We also found that mitochondrial proteomic profiles from tissues adjacent to nodules or tumor are determined more by the stage of HCC development than by tissue type, and we evaluated two models to predict HCC stage of the samples using proteomic profiles. Finally, we propose an omics integration pipeline to massively identify molecular features that could be further evaluated as key regulators, biomarkers or therapeutic targets. As an example, we show a group of miRNAs and transcription factors as candidates, responsible for mitochondrial metabolic modification in HCC.
PXD024872	34383978	Proteomic analysis of ubiquitination substrates reveals a CTLH E3 ligase complex-dependent regulation of glycolysis. 	Global and diGLY enriched proteomes of RanBPM depleted HeLa cells and RanBPM APMS	CTLH complex, HeLa	Ubiquitination is an essential post-translational modification that regulates protein stability or function. Its substrate specificity is dictated by various E3 ligases. The human C-terminal to LisH (CTLH) complex is a newly discovered multi-subunit really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ligase with only a few known ubiquitination targets. Here, we used mass spectrometry-based proteomic techniques to gain insight into CTLH complex function and ubiquitination substrates in HeLa cells. First, global proteomics determined proteins that were significantly increased, and thus may be substrates targeted for degradation, in cells depleted of CTLH complex member RanBPM. RanBPM-dependent ubiquitination determined using diGLY-enriched proteomics and the endogenous RanBPM interactome further revealed candidate ubiquitination targets. Three glycolysis enzymes alpha-enolase, L-lactate dehydrogenase A chain (LDHA), and pyruvate kinase M1/2 (PKM) had decreased ubiquitin sites in shRanBPM cells and were found associated with RanBPM in the interactome. Reduced polyubiquitination was validated for PKM2 and LDHA in cells depleted of RanBPM and CTLH complex RING domain subunit RMND5A. PKM2 and LDHA protein levels were unchanged, yet their activity was increased in extracts of cells with downregulated RanBPM. Finally, RanBPM deficient cells displayed enhanced glycolysis and deregulated central carbon metabolism. Overall, this study identifies potential CTLH complex ubiquitination substrates and uncovers that the CTLH complex inhibits glycolysis via non-degradative ubiquitination of PKM2 and LDHA.
PXD027351	34384028	Online Nanoflow Two-Dimension Comprehensive Active Modulation Reversed Phase-Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry for Metaproteomics of Environmental and Microbiome Samples. 	Online Nanoflow Two-Dimension Comprehensive Active Modulation Reversed Phase-Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry for Metaproteomics of Environmen-tal and Microbiome Samples	2DLC, LC, LCMS, RPRP, automated, comprehensive active modulation, metaproteomics, ocean	Metaproteomics is a powerful analytical approach that can assess the functional capabilities deployed by microbial communities in both environmental and biomedical microbiome settings. Yet, the mass spectra resulting from these mixed biological communities are challenging to obtain due to the high number of low intensity peak features. The use of multiple dimensions of chromatographic separation prior to mass spectrometry analyses has been applied to proteomics previously but can require increased sampling handling and instrument time. Here, we demonstrate an automated online comprehensive active modulation two-dimensional liquid chromatography method for metaproteome sample analysis. A high pH PLRP-S column was used in the first dimension followed by low pH separation in the second dimension using dual modulating C18 traps and a C18 column. This method increased the number of unique peptides found in ocean metaproteome samples by more than 50% when compared to a one-dimension separation while using the same amount of sample and instrument time.
PXD022044	34385319	Structure of autoinhibited Akt1 reveals mechanism of PIP3-mediated activation. 	Mapping and quantification of phosphorylation sites on protein kinase Akt by LC-MS/MS	Akt1, PIP3, growth factor signaling, lipid second messengers	The protein kinase Akt is one of the primary effectors of growth factor signaling in the cell. Akt responds specifically to the lipid second messengers phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] and phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2] via its PH domain, leading to phosphorylation of its activation loop and the hydrophobic motif of its kinase domain, which are critical for activity. We have now determined the crystal structure of Akt1, revealing an autoinhibitory interface between the PH and kinase domains that is often mutated in cancer and overgrowth disorders. This interface persists even after stoichiometric phosphorylation, thereby restricting maximum Akt activity to PI(3,4,5)P3- or PI(3,4)P2-containing membranes. Our work helps to resolve the roles of lipids and phosphorylation in the activation of Akt and has wide implications for the spatiotemporal control of Akt and potentially lipid-activated kinase signaling in general.
PXD026651	34385580	Expression of a human cDNA in moss results in spliced mRNAs and fragmentary protein isoforms. 	Expression of a human cDNA in moss results in spliced mRNAs and fragmentary protein isoforms	Physcomitrium patens, aberrant mRNA-splicing, blood coagulation factor IX, heterologous expression systems	Production of biopharmaceuticals relies on the expression of mammalian cDNAs in host organisms. Here we show that the expression of a human cDNA in the moss Physcomitrium patens generates the expected full-length and four additional transcripts due to unexpected splicing. This mRNA splicing results in non-functional protein isoforms, cellular misallocation of the proteins and low product yields. We integrated these results together with the results of our analysis of all 32,926 protein-encoding Physcomitrella genes and their 87,533 annotated transcripts in a web application, physCO, for automatized optimization. A thus optimized cDNA results in about twelve times more protein, which correctly localizes to the ER. An analysis of codon preferences of different production hosts suggests that similar effects occur also in non-plant hosts. We anticipate that the use of our methodology will prevent so far undetected mRNA heterosplicing resulting in maximized functional protein amounts for basic biology and biotechnology.
PXD027119	34385591	Prediction and verification of the AD-FTLD common pathomechanism based on dynamic molecular network analysis. 	AD and FTLD model mouse, brain, Phosphoproteome	AD, FTD, FTLD, phosphoproteome	Multiple gene mutations cause familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) while no single gene mutations exists in sporadic FTLD. Various proteins aggregate in variable regions of the brain, leading to multiple pathological and clinical prototypes. The heterogeneity of FTLD could be one of the reasons preventing development of disease-modifying therapy. We newly develop a mathematical method to analyze chronological changes of PPI networks with sequential big data from comprehensive phosphoproteome of four FTLD knock-in (KI) mouse models (PGRN(R504X)-KI, TDP43(N267S)-KI, VCP(T262A)-KI and CHMP2B(Q165X)-KI mice) together with four transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and with APP(KM670/671NL)-KI mice at multiple time points. The new method reveals the common core pathological network across FTLD and AD, which is shared by mouse models and human postmortem brains. Based on the prediction, we performed therapeutic intervention of the FTLD models, and confirmed amelioration of pathologies and symptoms of four FTLD mouse models by interruption of the core molecule HMGB1, verifying the new mathematical method to predict dynamic molecular networks.
PXD023295	34388859	Drosophila yellow-h encodes dopaminechrome tautomerase: A new enzyme in the eumelanin biosynthetic pathway. 	Drosophila yellow-h, dopaminechrome tautomerase	Drosophila, dopamine, dopaminechrome, eumelanin, melanogenesis, tautomerase, yellow-h	Melanin is a widely distributed phenolic pigment that is biosynthesized from tyrosine and its hydroxylated product, dopa, in all animals. However, recent studies reveal a significant deviation from this paradigm, as insects appear to use dopamine rather than dopa as the major precursor of melanin. This observation calls for a reconsideration of the insect melanogenic pathway. While phenoloxidases and laccases can oxidize dopamine for dopaminechrome production, the fate of dopaminechrome remains undetermined. Dopachrome decarboxylase/tautomerase, encoded by yellow-f/f2 of Drosophila melanogaster, can convert dopaminechrome into 5,6-dihydroxyindole, but the same enzyme from other organisms does not act on dopaminechrome, suggesting the existence of a specific dopaminechrome tautomerase (DPT). We now report the identification of this novel enzyme that biosynthesizes 5,6-dihydroxyindole from dopaminechrome in Drosophila. Dopaminechrome tautomerase acted on both dopaminechrome and N-methyl dopaminechrome but not on dopachrome or other aminochromes tested. Our biochemical and molecular studies reveal that this enzyme is encoded by the yellow-h gene, a member of the yellow gene family, and advance our understanding of the physiological functions of this gene family. Identification and characterization of DPT clarifies the precursor for melanin biosynthetic pathways and proves the existence of an independent melanogenic pathway in insects that utilizes dopamine as the primary precursor.
PXD025391	34389466	Characterization of an A3G-VifHIV-1-CRL5-CBFbeta Structure Using a Cross-linking Mass Spectrometry Pipeline for Integrative Modeling of Host-Pathogen Complexes. 	A3G-Vif-CBFB-CRL5 Cross-Linking with DSSO	APOBEC3G, DSSO, HIV Vif, XL-MS, integrative modeling	Structural analysis of host-pathogen protein complexes remains challenging, largely due to their structural heterogeneity. Here, we describe a pipeline for the structural characterization of these complexes using integrative structure modeling based on chemical cross-links and residue-protein contacts inferred from mutagenesis studies. We used this approach on the HIV-1 Vif protein bound to restriction factor APOBEC3G (A3G), the Cullin-5 E3 ring ligase (CRL5), and the cellular transcription factor Core Binding Factor Beta (CBFbeta) to determine the structure of the (A3G-Vif-CRL5-CBFbeta) complex. Using the MS-cleavable DSSO cross-linker to obtain a set of 132 cross-links within this reconstituted complex along with the atomic structures of the subunits and mutagenesis data, we computed an integrative structure model of the heptameric A3G-Vif-CRL5-CBFbeta complex. The structure, which was validated using a series of tests, reveals that A3G is bound to Vif mostly through its N-terminal domain. Moreover, the model ensemble quantifies the dynamic heterogeneity of the A3G C-terminal domain and Cul5 positions. Finally, the model was used to rationalize previous structural, mutagenesis and functional data not used for modeling, including information related to the A3G-bound and unbound structures as well as mapping functional mutations to the A3G-Vif interface. The experimental and computational approach described here is generally applicable to other challenging host-pathogen protein complexes.
PXD024479	34389733	The conformational stability of pro-apoptotic BAX is dictated by discrete residues of the protein core. 	The Conformational Stability of Pro-apoptotic BAX is Dictated by Discrete Residues of the Protein Core	BAX, Bcl-2 protein, HDXMS, apoptosis, hydrogen deuterium exchange	BAX is a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, which regulates the balance between cellular life and death. During homeostasis, BAX predominantly resides in the cytosol as a latent monomer but, in response to stress, transforms into an oligomeric protein that permeabilizes the mitochondria, leading to apoptosis. Because renegade BAX activation poses a grave risk to the cell, the architecture of BAX must ensure monomeric stability yet enable conformational change upon stress signaling. The specific structural features that afford both stability and dynamic flexibility remain ill-defined and represent a critical control point of BAX regulation. We identify a nexus of interactions involving four residues of the BAX core alpha5 helix that are individually essential to maintaining the structure and latency of monomeric BAX and are collectively required for dimeric assembly. The dual yet distinct roles of these residues reveals the intricacy of BAX conformational regulation and opportunities for therapeutic modulation.
PXD023648	34390184	A simple organic solvent precipitation method to improve detection of low molecular weight proteins. 	A sub-optimal protein precipitation method to improve identification of low molecular weight less abundant proteins	breast cacner cell line, low molecular weight protein, protein precipitation, serum, small protein, tumour	Mass spectrometry-based proteomics revolutionized global proteomic profiling. Although high molecular weight abundant proteins are readily sampled in global proteomics studies, less abundant low molecular weight proteins are often underrepresented. This includes biologically important classes of low molecular weight proteins including ligands, growth factors, peptide hormones and cytokines. Although extensive fractionation can facilitate achieving better coverage of proteome, it requires additional infrastructure, mass spectrometry time and labour. There is need for a simple method that can selectively deplete high molecular weight abundant proteins and enrich for low molecular weight less abundant proteins to improve their coverage in proteomics studies. We present a simple organic-solvent based protein precipitation method that selectively depletes high molecular weight proteins and enriches low molecular weight proteins in the soluble fraction. Using this strategy, we demonstrate identification of low molecular weight proteins that are generally underrepresented in proteomics datasets. In addition, we show the utility of this approach in identifying functional cleavage products from precursor proteins and low molecular weight short open reading frame proteins encoded by non-coding regions such as lncRNAs and UTRs. As the method does not require additional infrastructure, it can complement existing proteomics workflows to increase detection and coverage of low molecular weight proteins that are less abundant.
PXD023224	34391444	PI3K-AKT, JAK2-STAT3 pathways and cell-cell contact regulate maspin subcellular localization. 	PI3K-AKT pathway and cell-cell contact regulates maspin nuclear localization	EGFR, Jak-STAT, PI3K-AKT, cell-to-cell contact, maspin	BACKGROUND: Maspin (SERPINB5) is a potential tumor suppressor gene with pleiotropic biological activities, including regulation of cell proliferation, death, adhesion, migration and gene expression. Several studies indicate that nuclear localization is essential for maspin tumor suppression activity. We have previously shown that the EGFR activation leads to maspin nuclear localization in MCF-10A cells. The present study investigated which EGFR downstream signaling molecules are involved in maspin nuclear localization and explored a possible role of cell-cell contact in this process. METHODS: MCF-10A cells were treated with pharmacological inhibitors against EGFR downstream pathways followed by EGF treatment. Maspin subcellular localization was determined by immunofluorescence. Proteomic and interactome analyses were conducted to identify maspin-binding proteins in EGF-treated cells only. To investigate the role of cell-cell contact these cells were either treated with chelating agents or plated on different cell densities. Maspin and E-cadherin subcellular localization was determined by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: We found that PI3K-Akt and JAK2-STAT3, but not MAP kinase pathway, regulate EGF-induced maspin nuclear accumulation in MCF-10A cells. We observed that maspin is predominantly nuclear in sparse cell culture, but it is redistributed to the cytoplasm in confluent cells even in the presence of EGF. Proteomic and interactome results suggest a role of maspin on post-transcriptional and translation regulation, protein folding and cell-cell adhesion. CONCLUSIONS: Maspin nuclear accumulation is determined by an interplay between EGFR (via PI3K-Akt and JAK2-STAT3 pathways) and cell-cell contact. Video Abstract.
PXD022949	34391887	Proteogenomic Analysis Unveils the HLA Class I-Presented Immunopeptidome in Melanoma and EGFR-Mutant Lung Adenocarcinoma. 	Proteogenomic analysis unveils the HLA Class I presented immunopeptidome in melanoma and EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma	HLA immunopeptidome, immunotherapy, lung cancer, melanoma, neoantigen	Immune checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive lymphocyte transfer-based therapies have shown great therapeutic potential in cancers with high tumor mutational burden (TMB), such as melanoma, but not in cancers with low TMB, such as mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung adenocarcinoma. Precision immunotherapy is an unmet need for most cancers, particularly for cancers that respond inadequately to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here, we employed large-scale MS-based proteogenomic profiling to identify potential immunogenic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-presented peptides in melanoma and EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Similar numbers of peptides were identified from both tumor types. Cell line and patient-specific databases (DBs) were constructed using variants identified from whole-exome sequencing. A de novo search algorithm was used to interrogate the HLA class I immunopeptidome MS data. We identified 12 variant peptides and several classes of tumor-associated antigen-derived peptides. We constructed a cancer germ line (CG) antigen DB with 285 antigens. This allowed us to identify 40 class I-presented CG antigen-derived peptides. The class I immunopeptidome comprised more than 1000 post-translationally modified (PTM) peptides representing 58 different PTMs, underscoring the critical role PTMs may play in HLA binding. Finally, leveraging de novo search algorithm and an annotated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) DB, we developed a novel lncRNA-encoded peptide discovery pipeline to identify 44 lncRNA-derived peptides that are presented by class I. We validated tandem MS spectra of select variant, CG antigen, and lncRNA-derived peptides using synthetic peptides and performed HLA class I-binding assays to demonstrate binding to class I proteins. In summary, we provide direct evidence of HLA class I presentation of a large number of variant and tumor-associated peptides in both low and high TMB cancer. These results can potentially be useful for precision immunotherapies, such as vaccine or adoptive cell therapies in melanoma and EGFR-mutant lung cancers.
PXD027165	34391888	Optimized Liquid and Gas Phase Fractionation Increases HLA-Peptidome Coverage for Primary Cell and Tissue Samples. 	Optimized liquid and gas phase fractionations increase HLA-peptidome coverage for primary cell and tissue samples	HLA, targeted MS	MS is the most effective method to directly identify peptides presented on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. However, current standard approaches often use 500 million or more cells as input to achieve high coverage of the immunopeptidome, and therefore, these methods are not compatible with the often limited amounts of tissue available from clinical tumor samples. Here, we evaluated microscaled basic reversed-phase fractionation to separate HLA peptide samples offline followed by ion mobility coupled to LC-MS/MS for analysis. The combination of these two separation methods enabled identification of 20% to 50% more peptides compared with samples analyzed without either prior fractionation or use of ion mobility alone. We demonstrate coverage of HLA immunopeptidomes with up to 8107 distinct peptides starting with as few as 100 million cells. The increased sensitivity obtained using our methods can provide data useful to improve HLA-binding prediction algorithms as well as to enable detection of clinically relevant epitopes such as neoantigens.
PXD025442	34395429	CD30-Positive Extracellular Vesicles Enable the Targeting of CD30-Negative DLBCL Cells by the CD30 Antibody-Drug Conjugate Brentuximab Vedotin. 	Targeting of CD30-negative tumor cells in DLBCL with Brentuximab-vedotin through CD30-positive extracellular vesicles, in vitro	CD30, extracellular vesicles, tumor cells	CD30, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is selectively expressed on a subset of activated lymphocytes and on malignant cells of certain lymphomas, such as classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL), where it activates critical bystander cells in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, it is not surprising that the CD30 antibody-drug conjugate Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) represents a powerful, FDA-approved treatment option for CD30(+) hematological malignancies. However, BV also exerts a strong anti-cancer efficacy in many cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with poor CD30 expression, even when lacking detectable CD30(+) tumor cells. The mechanism remains enigmatic. Because CD30 is released on extracellular vesicles (EVs) from both, malignant and activated lymphocytes, we studied whether EV-associated CD30 might end up in CD30(-) tumor cells to provide binding sites for BV. Notably, CD30(+) EVs bind to various DLBCL cell lines as well as to the FITC-labeled variant of the antibody-drug conjugate BV, thus potentially conferring the BV binding also to CD30(-) cells. Confocal microscopy and imaging cytometry studies revealed that BV binding and uptake depend on CD30(+) EVs. Since BV is only toxic toward CD30(-) DLBCL cells when CD30(+) EVs support its uptake, we conclude that EVs not only communicate within the tumor microenvironment but also influence cancer treatment. Ultimately, the CD30-based BV not only targets CD30(+) tumor cell but also CD30(-) DLBCL cells in the presence of CD30(+) EVs. Our study thus provides a feasible explanation for the clinical impact of BV in CD30(-) DLBCL and warrants confirming studies in animal models.
PXD025957	34400330	Silencing of ceramide synthase 2 in hepatocytes modulates plasma ceramide biomarkers predictive of cardiovascular death. 	Liver proteome upon in vivo N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide silencing of ceramide synthase 2	Liver, ceramide synthase 2, silencing	Emerging clinical data show that three ceramide molecules, Cer d18:1/16:0, Cer d18:1/24:1, and Cer d18:1/24:0, are biomarkers of a fatal outcome in patients with cardiovascular disease. This finding raises basic questions about their metabolic origin, their contribution to disease pathogenesis, and the utility of targeting the underlying enzymatic machinery for treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. Here, we outline the development of a potent N-acetylgalactosamine-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide engineered to silence ceramide synthase 2 specifically in hepatocytes in vivo. We demonstrate that this compound reduces the ceramide synthase 2 mRNA level and that this translates into efficient lowering of protein expression and activity as well as Cer d18:1/24:1 and Cer d18:1/24:0 levels in liver. Intriguingly, we discover that the hepatocyte-specific antisense oligonucleotide also triggers a parallel modulation of blood plasma ceramides, revealing that the biomarkers predictive of cardiovascular death are governed by ceramide biosynthesis in hepatocytes. Our work showcases a generic therapeutic framework for targeting components of the ceramide enzymatic machinery to disentangle their roles in disease causality and to explore their utility for treatment of cardiometabolic disorders.
PXD022944	34400635	Structural basis for ALK2/BMPR2 receptor complex signaling through kinase domain oligomerization. 	Structural basis for ALK2/BMPR2 receptor complex signaling through kinase domain oligomerization	ALK2, BMPR2, HDX-MS	Upon ligand binding, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors form active tetrameric complexes, comprised of two type I and two type II receptors, which then transmit signals to SMAD proteins. The link between receptor tetramerization and the mechanism of kinase activation, however, has not been elucidated. Here, using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, combined with analysis of SMAD signaling, we show that the kinase domain of the type I receptor ALK2 and type II receptor BMPR2 form a heterodimeric complex via their C-terminal lobes. Formation of this dimer is essential for ligand-induced receptor signaling and is targeted by mutations in BMPR2 in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We further show that the type I/type II kinase domain heterodimer serves as the scaffold for assembly of the active tetrameric receptor complexes to enable phosphorylation of the GS domain and activation of SMADs.
PXD021701	34400640	Large-scale and high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics profiling defines molecular subtypes of esophageal cancer for therapeutic targeting. 	Large-scale and high-resolutionmass spectrometry-based proteomics profiling defines molecular subtypes of esophageal cancer for therapeutic targeting	Esophageal cancer,TMT,Proteomics	Esophageal cancer (EC) is a type of aggressive cancer without clinically relevant molecular subtypes, hindering the development of effective strategies for treatment. To define molecular subtypes of EC, we perform mass spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomics profiling of EC tumors and adjacent non-tumor tissues, revealing a catalog of proteins and phosphosites that are dysregulated in ECs. The EC cohort is stratified into two molecular subtypes-S1 and S2-based on proteomic analysis, with the S2 subtype characterized by the upregulation of spliceosomal and ribosomal proteins, and being more aggressive. Moreover, we identify a subtype signature composed of ELOA and SCAF4, and construct a subtype diagnostic and prognostic model. Potential drugs are predicted for treating patients of S2 subtype, and three candidate drugs are validated to inhibit EC. Taken together, our proteomic analysis define molecular subtypes of EC, thus providing a potential therapeutic outlook for improving disease outcomes in patients with EC.
PXD024585	34400895	Alendronate-induced Perturbation of the Bone Proteome and Microenvironmental Pathophysiology. 	Alendronate and Osteonecrosis of the Jaw	Alendronate, Osteonecrosis, RIPK3, WNT/GSK3/B-Catenin	Objectives: Bisphosphonates (BPs) are powerful inhibitors of osteoclastogenesis and are used to prevent osteoporotic bone loss and reduce the risk of osteoporotic fracture in patients suffering from postmenopausal osteoporosis. Patients with breast cancer or gynecological malignancies being treated with BPs or those receiving bone-targeted therapy for metastatic prostate cancer are at increased risk of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). Although BPs markedly ameliorate osteoporosis, their adverse effects largely limit the clinical application of these drugs. This study focused on providing a deeper understanding of one of the most popular BPs, the alendronate (ALN)-induced perturbation of the bone proteome and microenvironmental pathophysiology. Methods: To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying ALN-induced side-effects, an unbiased and global proteomics approach combined with big data bioinformatics was applied. This was followed by biochemical and functional analyses to determine the clinicopathological mechanisms affected by ALN. Results: The findings from this proteomics study suggest that the RIPK3/Wnt/GSK3/beta-catenin signaling pathway is significantly perturbed upon ALN treatment, resulting in abnormal angiogenesis, inflammation, anabolism, remodeling, and mineralization in bone cells in an in vitro cell culture system. Conclusion: Our investigation into potential key signaling mechanisms in response to ALN provides a rational basis for suppressing BP-induced adverse effect and presents various therapeutic strategies.
PXD026837	34403458	De-dimerization of PTB is catalyzed by PDI and is involved in the regulation of p53 translation. 	Identification of PTB Î”NLS-GFP interacting proteins precipitated by magnetic beads against GFP	PTB	Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is an RNA binding protein existing both as dimer and monomer and shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm. However, the regulation of PTB dimerization and the relationship between their functions and subcellular localization are unknown. Here we find that PTB presents as dimer and monomer in nucleus and cytoplasm respectively, and a disulfide bond involving Cysteine 23 is critical for the dimerization of PTB. Additionally, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is identified to be the enzyme that catalyzes the de-dimerization of PTB, which is dependent on the CGHC active site of the a' domain of PDI. Furthermore, upon DNA damage induced by topoisomerase inhibitors, PTB is demonstrated to be de-dimerized with cytoplasmic accumulation. Finally, cytoplasmic PTB is found to associate with the ribosome and enhances the translation of p53. Collectively, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism of PTB dimerization, and shed light on the de-dimerization of PTB functionally linking to cytoplasmic localization and translational regulation.
PXD023032	34404349	Immunopeptidomics toolkit library (IPTK): a python-based modular toolbox for analyzing immunopeptidomics data. 	The immunopeptidome of HLA-DR from PBMC	HLA-DR, HLA-II, Human blood, PBMC, immunopeptidome	BACKGROUND: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins play a fundamental role in the adaptive immune system as they present peptides to T cells. Mass-spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics is a promising and powerful tool for characterizing the immunopeptidomic landscape of HLA proteins, that is the peptides presented on HLA proteins. Despite the growing interest in the technology, and the recent rise of immunopeptidomics-specific identification pipelines, there is still a gap in data-analysis and software tools that are specialized in analyzing and visualizing immunopeptidomics data. RESULTS: We present the IPTK library which is an open-source Python-based library for analyzing, visualizing, comparing, and integrating different omics layers with the identified peptides for an in-depth characterization of the immunopeptidome. Using different datasets, we illustrate the ability of the library to enrich the result of the identified peptidomes. Also, we demonstrate the utility of the library in developing other software and tools by developing an easy-to-use dashboard that can be used for the interactive analysis of the results. CONCLUSION: IPTK provides a modular and extendable framework for analyzing and integrating immunopeptidomes with different omics layers. The library is deployed into PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/IPTKL/ and into Bioconda at https://anaconda.org/bioconda/iptkl , while the source code of the library and the dashboard, along with the online tutorials are available at https://github.com/ikmb/iptoolkit .
PXD017890	34404790	Genome-scale target identification in Escherichia coli for high-titer production of free fatty acids. 	Genome-wide targets identification  for high-titer production of free fatty acids in Escherichia coli	Escherichia coli, free fatty acids, targets identification	To construct a superior microbial cell factory for chemical synthesis, a major challenge is to fully exploit cellular potential by identifying and engineering beneficial gene targets in sophisticated metabolic networks. Here, we take advantage of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and omics analyses to systematically identify beneficial genes that can be engineered to promote free fatty acids (FFAs) production in Escherichia coli. CRISPRi-mediated genetic perturbation enables the identification of 30 beneficial genes from 108 targets related to FFA metabolism. Then, omics analyses of the FFAs-overproducing strains and a control strain enable the identification of another 26 beneficial genes that are seemingly irrelevant to FFA metabolism. Combinatorial perturbation of four beneficial genes involving cellular stress responses results in a recombinant strain ihfA(L-)-aidB(+)-ryfA(M-)-gadA(H-), producing 30.0 g L(-1) FFAs in fed-batch fermentation, the maximum titer in E. coli reported to date. Our findings are of help in rewiring cellular metabolism and interwoven intracellular processes to facilitate high-titer production of biochemicals.
PXD023578	34404802	ELMO1 signaling is a promoter of osteoclast function and bone loss. 	ELMO1 signaling is a promoter of osteoclast function and bone loss	ELMO1, GeLC-MS, Osteoclasts, bone loss	Osteoporosis affects millions worldwide and is often caused by osteoclast induced bone loss. Here, we identify the cytoplasmic protein ELMO1 as an important 'signaling node' in osteoclasts. We note that ELMO1 SNPs associate with bone abnormalities in humans, and that ELMO1 deletion in mice reduces bone loss in four in vivo models: osteoprotegerin deficiency, ovariectomy, and two types of inflammatory arthritis. Our transcriptomic analyses coupled with CRISPR/Cas9 genetic deletion identify Elmo1 associated regulators of osteoclast function, including cathepsin G and myeloperoxidase. Further, we define the 'ELMO1 interactome' in osteoclasts via proteomics and reveal proteins required for bone degradation. ELMO1 also contributes to osteoclast sealing zone on bone-like surfaces and distribution of osteoclast-specific proteases. Finally, a 3D structure-based ELMO1 inhibitory peptide reduces bone resorption in wild type osteoclasts. Collectively, we identify ELMO1 as a signaling hub that regulates osteoclast function and bone loss, with relevance to osteoporosis and arthritis.
PXD025012	34408139	Off-the-shelf proximity biotinylation for interaction proteomics. 	â€˜Off the shelf' proximity biotinylation for interaction proteomics	FLYWCH1, Proximity labelling, interactome, protein A, turboID	Proximity biotinylation workflows typically require CRISPR-based genetic manipulation of target cells. To overcome this bottleneck, we fused the TurboID proximity biotinylation enzyme to Protein A. Upon target cell permeabilization, the ProtA-Turbo enzyme can be targeted to proteins or post-translational modifications of interest using bait-specific antibodies. Addition of biotin then triggers bait-proximal protein biotinylation. Biotinylated proteins can subsequently be enriched from crude lysates and identified by mass spectrometry. We demonstrate this workflow by targeting Emerin, H3K9me3 and BRG1. Amongst the main findings, our experiments reveal that the essential protein FLYWCH1 interacts with a subset of H3K9me3-marked (peri)centromeres in human cells. The ProtA-Turbo enzyme represents an off-the-shelf proximity biotinylation enzyme that facilitates proximity biotinylation experiments in primary cells and can be used to understand how proteins cooperate in vivo and how this contributes to cellular homeostasis and disease.
PXD020887	34408142	Grafting of iPS cell-derived tenocytes promotes motor function recovery after Achilles tendon rupture. 	Grafting induced pluripotent stem cells-derived tenocytes contribute to recovery of motor function after Achilles tendon rupture in rat	Tendon, Tenocyte, iPSC	Tendon self-renewal is a rare occurrence because of the poor vascularization of this tissue; therefore, reconstructive surgery using autologous tendon is often performed in severe injury cases. However, the post-surgery re-injury rate is relatively high, and the collection of autologous tendons leads to muscle weakness, resulting in prolonged rehabilitation. Here, we introduce an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based technology to develop a therapeutic option for tendon injury. First, we derived tenocytes from human iPSCs by recapitulating the normal progression of step-wise narrowing fate decisions in vertebrate embryos. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the developmental trajectory of iPSC-derived tenocytes. We demonstrated that iPSC-tenocyte grafting contributed to motor function recovery after Achilles tendon injury in rats via engraftment and paracrine effects. The biomechanical strength of regenerated tendons was comparable to that of healthy tendons. We suggest that iPSC-tenocytes will provide a therapeutic option for tendon injury.
PXD006671	34409283	PRIMUS: Comprehensive proteomics of mouse intervertebral discs that inform novel biology and relevance to human disease modelling. 	Proteomic landscape of murine intervertebral disc reveals mechanisms involved in homeostasis and disc structure maintenance	Mouse intervertebral disc, annulus fibrosus, homeostasis, nucleus pulposus, structure maintenance	Mice are commonly used to study intervertebral disc (IVD) biology and related diseases such as IVD degeneration. Discs from both the lumbar and tail regions are used. However, little is known about compartmental characteristics in the different regions, nor their relevance to the human setting, where a functional IVD unit depends on a homeostatic proteome. Here, we address these major gaps through comprehensive proteomic profiling and in-depth analyses of 8-week-old healthy murine discs, followed by comparisons with human. Leveraging on a dataset of over 2,700 proteins from 31 proteomic profiles, we identified key molecular and cellular differences between disc compartments and spine levels, but not gender. The nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) compartments differ the most, both in matrisome and cellularity contents. Differences in the matrisome are consistent with the fibrous nature required for tensile strength in the AF and hydration property in the NP. Novel findings for the NP cells included an enrichment in cell junction proteins for cell-cell communication (Cdh2, Dsp and Gja1) and osmoregulation (Slc12a2 and Wnk1). In NP cells, we detected heterogeneity of vacuolar organelles; where about half have potential lysosomal function (Vamp3, Copb2, Lamp1/2, Lamtor1), some contain lipid droplets and others with undefined contents. The AF is enriched in proteins for the oxidative stress responses (Sod3 and Clu). Interestingly, mitochondrial proteins are elevated in the lumbar than tail IVDs that may reflect differences in metabolic requirement. Relative to the human, cellular and structural information are conserved for the AF. Even though the NP is more divergent between mouse and human, there are similarities at the level of cell biology. Further, common cross-species markers were identified for both NP (KRT8/19, CD109) and AF (COL12A1). Overall, mouse is a relevant model to study IVD biology, and an understanding of the limitation will facilitate research planning and data interpretation, maximizing the translation of research findings to human IVDs.
PXD012977	34409731	Proteomic profiling of the oncogenic septin 9 reveals isoform-specific interactions in breast cancer cells. 	Proteomic profiling of the oncogenic septin 9 reveals isoform-specific interactions in breast cancer cells	SEPT9, breast cancer, septin interactome, septins	Septins are a family of multimeric GTP-binding proteins, which are abnormally expressed in cancer. Septin 9 (SEPT9) is an essential and ubiquitously expressed septin with multiple isoforms, which have differential expression patterns and effects in breast cancer cells. It is unknown, however, if SEPT9 isoforms associate with different molecular networks and functions. Here, we performed a proteomic screen in MCF-7 breast cancer cells to identify the interactome of GFP-SEPT9 isoforms 1, 4 and 5, which vary significantly in their N-terminal extensions. While all three isoforms associated with SEPT2 and SEPT7, the truncated SEPT9_i4 and SEPT9_i5 interacted with septins of the SEPT6 group more promiscuously than SEPT9_i1, which bound predominately SEPT8. Spatial mapping and functional clustering of non-septin partners showed isoform-specific differences in interactions with proteins of distinct subcellular organelles (e.g., nuclei, centrosomes, cilia) and functions such as cell signalling and ubiquitination. The interactome of the full length SEPT9_i1 was more enriched in cytoskeletal regulators, while the truncated SEPT9_i4 and SEPT9_i5 exhibited preferential and isoform-specific interactions with nuclear, signalling, and ubiquitinating proteins. These data provide evidence for isoform-specific interactions, which arise from truncations in the N-terminal extensions of SEPT9, and point to novel roles in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.
PXD023551	34411234	Adaptive Mechanisms of Somatostatin-Positive Interneurons after Traumatic Brain Injury through a Switch of alpha Subunits in L-Type Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels. 	LFQ proteomics of mouse GABAergic interneurons during traumatic brain injury	Inhibitory interneurons, L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, Neuroplasticity, Traumatic brain injury	Unilateral traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes cortical dysfunctions spreading to the primarily undamaged hemisphere. This phenomenon, called transhemispheric diaschisis, is mediated by an imbalance of glutamatergic versus GABAergic neurotransmission. This study investigated the role of GABAergic, somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons in the contralateral hemisphere 72 h after unilateral TBI. The brain injury was induced to the primary motor/somatosensory cortex of glutamate decarboxylase 67-green fluorescent protein (GAD67-GFP) knock-in mice at postnatal days 19-21 under anesthesia in vivo. Single GFP+ interneurons of the undamaged, contralateral cortex were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and analyzed by mass spectrometry. TBI caused a switch of 2 alpha subunits of pore-forming L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) in GABAergic interneurons, an increased expression of CaV1.3, and simultaneous ablation of CaV1.2. This switch was associated with 1) increased excitability of single SST interneurons in patch-clamp recordings and (2) a recovery from early network hyperactivity in the contralateral hemisphere in microelectrode array recordings of acute slices. The electrophysiological changes were sensitive to pharmacological blockade of CaV1.3 (isradipine, 100 nM). These data identify a switch of 2 alpha subunits of VGCCs in SST interneurons early after TBI as a mechanism to counterbalance post-traumatic hyperexcitability.
PXD024250	34411425	Proteomic analysis of koala (phascolarctos cinereus) spermatozoa and prostatic bodies. 	Proteomic analysis of koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) spermatozoa and prostatic bodies	Koala, Prostatic bodies, Spermatozoa	The aims of this study were to investigate the proteome of koala spermatozoa and that of the prostatic bodies with which they interact during ejaculation. For this purpose, spermatozoa and prostatic bodies were fractionated from the semen of four male koalas and analysed by HPLC MS/MS. This strategy identified 744 sperm and 1297 prostatic body proteins, which were subsequently attributed to 482 and 776 unique gene products, respectively. Gene ontology curation of the sperm proteome revealed an abundance of proteins mapping to the canonical sirtuin and 14-3-3 signalling pathways. By contrast, protein ubiquitination and unfolded protein response pathways dominated the equivalent analysis of proteins uniquely identified in prostatic bodies. Koala sperm proteins featured an enrichment of those mapping to the functional categories of cellular compromise/inflammatory response, whilst those of the prostatic body revealed an over-representation of molecular chaperone and stress-related proteins. Cross-species comparisons demonstrated that the koala sperm proteome displays greater conservation with that of eutherians (human; 93%) as opposed to reptile (crocodile; 39%) and avian (rooster; 27%) spermatozoa. Together, this work contributes to our overall understanding of the core sperm proteome and has identified biomarkers that may contribute to the exceptional longevity of koala spermatozoa during ex vivo storage.
PXD023617	34412652	A novel NF-kappaB regulator encoded by circPLCE1 inhibits colorectal carcinoma progression by promoting RPS3 ubiquitin-dependent degradation. 	Identification of interacting proteins with circPLCE1-411 in hunan colorectal cancer cell by LC-MS	LC-MS, circPLCE1-411, hunan colorectal cancer cell, interacting proteins	BACKGROUND: Constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling plays a key role in the development and progression of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). However, the underlying mechanisms of excessive activation of NF-kappaB signaling remain largely unknown. METHODS: We used high throughput RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) between normal human intestinal epithelial cell lines and CRC cell lines. The identification of protein encoded by circPLCE1 was performed using LC-MS. The function of novel protein was validated in vitro and in vivo by gain or loss of function assays. Mechanistic results were concluded by immunoprecipitation analyses. RESULTS: A novel protein circPLCE1-411 encoded by circular RNA circPLCE1 was identified as a crucial player in the NF-kappaB activation of CRC. Mechanistically, circPLCE1-411 promoted the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the critical NF-kappaB regulator RPS3 via directly binding the HSP90alpha/RPS3 complex to facilitate the dissociation of RPS3 from the complex, thereby reducing NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in CRC cells. Functionally, circPLCE1 inhibited tumor proliferation and metastasis in CRC cells, as well as patient-derived xenograft and orthotopic xenograft tumor models. Clinically, circPLCE1 was downregulated in CRC tissues and correlated with advanced clinical stages and poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: circPLCE1 presents an epigenetic mechanism which disrupts NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and serves as a novel and promising therapeutic target and prognostic marker.
PXD026636	34413202	Bacterial translation machinery for deliberate mistranslation of the genetic code. 	Translation machinery for deliberate mistranslation of the genetic code in Bacteria	aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, genetic code, mistranslation, tRNA	Inaccurate expression of the genetic code, also known as mistranslation, is an emerging paradigm in microbial studies. Growing evidence suggests that many microbial pathogens can deliberately mistranslate their genetic code to help invade a host or evade host immune responses. However, discovering different capacities for deliberate mistranslation remains a challenge because each group of pathogens typically employs a unique mistranslation mechanism. In this study, we address this problem by studying duplicated genes of aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases. Using bacterial prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) genes as an example, we identify an anomalous ProRS isoform, ProRSx, and a corresponding tRNA, tRNA(ProA), that are predominately found in plant pathogens from Streptomyces species. We then show that tRNA(ProA) has an unusual hybrid structure that allows this tRNA to mistranslate alanine codons as proline. Finally, we provide biochemical, genetic, and mass spectrometric evidence that cells which express ProRSx and tRNA(ProA) can translate GCU alanine codons as both alanine and proline. This dual use of alanine codons creates a hidden proteome diversity due to stochastic Ala-->Pro mutations in protein sequences. Thus, we show that important plant pathogens are equipped with a tool to alter the identity of their sense codons. This finding reveals the initial example of a natural tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair for dedicated mistranslation of sense codons.
PXD021867	34413467	Adaptive optimization of the OXPHOS assembly line partially compensates lrpprc-dependent mitochondrial translation defects in mice. 	Proteomics profiling of Lrpprc knockout mice liver mitochondria following resolution by hybrid CN/BN PAGE	Genetic mitochondrial disease, Lrpprc, liver mitochondria, mitochondri, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial electron transport chain, mitochondrial proteostasis, mitochondrial supercomplexes, mitochondrial translation, mitoribosomes	Mouse models of genetic mitochondrial disorders are generally used to understand specific molecular defects and their biochemical consequences, but rarely to map compensatory changes allowing survival. Here we took advantage of the extraordinary mitochondrial resilience of hepatic Lrpprc knockout mice to explore this question using native proteomics profiling and lipidomics. In these mice, low levels of the mtRNA binding protein LRPPRC induce a global mitochondrial translation defect and a severe reduction (>80%) in the assembly and activity of the electron transport chain (ETC) complex IV (CIV). Yet, animals show no signs of overt liver failure and capacity of the ETC is preserved. Beyond stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, results show that the abundance of mitoribosomes per unit of mitochondria is increased and proteostatic mechanisms are induced in presence of low LRPPRC levels to preserve a balance in the availability of mitochondrial- vs nuclear-encoded ETC subunits. At the level of individual organelles, a stabilization of residual CIV in supercomplexes (SCs) is observed, pointing to a role of these supramolecular arrangements in preserving ETC function. While the SC assembly factor COX7A2L could not contribute to the stabilization of CIV, important changes in membrane glycerophospholipid (GPL), most notably an increase in SC-stabilizing cardiolipins species (CLs), were observed along with an increased abundance of other supramolecular assemblies known to be stabilized by, and/or participate in CL metabolism. Together these data reveal a complex in vivo network of molecular adjustments involved in preserving mitochondrial integrity in energy consuming organs facing OXPHOS defects, which could be therapeutically exploited.
PXD023684	34415762	Allotype-Specific Glycosylation and Cellular Localization of Human Leukocyte Antigen Class I Proteins. 	Allotype-specific glycosylation and cellular localization of HLA class I proteins	HLA, MHC, glycoproteomics	Presentation of antigens by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes at the cell surface is a key process in the immune response. The alpha-chain, containing the peptide-binding groove, is one of the most polymorphic proteins in the proteome. All HLA class I alpha-chains carry a conserved N-glycosylation site, but little is known about its nature and function. Here, we report an in-depth characterization of N-glycosylation features of HLA class I molecules. We observe that different HLA-A alpha-chains carry similar glycosylation, distinctly different from the HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-F alpha-chains. Although HLA-A displays the broadest variety of glycan characteristics, HLA-B alpha-chains carry mostly mature glycans, and HLA-C and HLA-F alpha-chains carry predominantly high-mannose glycans. We expected these glycosylation features to be directly linked to cellular localization of the HLA complexes. Indeed, analyzing HLA class I complexes from crude plasma and inner membrane-enriched fractions confirmed that most HLA-B complexes can be found at the plasma membrane, while most HLA-C and HLA-F molecules reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane, and HLA-A molecules are more equally distributed over these cellular compartments. This allotype-specific cellular distribution of HLA molecules should be taken into account when analyzing peptide antigen presentation by immunopeptidomics.
PXD027068	34416233	Interactome analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans synapses by TurboID-based proximity labeling. 	Interactome analysis of C. elegans synapses by TurboID-based proximity labeling	interactome Caenorhabditis elegans turboID proximity proteomics biotin labeling	Proximity labeling provides a powerful in vivo tool to characterize the proteome of subcellular structures and the interactome of specific proteins. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the most intensely studied organisms in biology, offering many advantages for biochemistry. Using the highly active biotin ligase TurboID, we optimize here a proximity labeling protocol for C. elegans. An advantage of TurboID is that biotin's high affinity for streptavidin means biotin-labeled proteins can be affinity-purified under harsh denaturing conditions. By combining extensive sonication with aggressive denaturation using SDS and urea, we achieved near-complete solubilization of worm proteins. We then used this protocol to characterize the proteomes of the worm gut, muscle, skin, and nervous system. Neurons are among the smallest C. elegans cells. To probe the method's sensitivity, we expressed TurboID exclusively in the two AFD neurons and showed that the protocol could identify known and previously unknown proteins expressed selectively in AFD. The active zones of synapses are composed of a protein matrix that is difficult to solubilize and purify. To test if our protocol could solubilize active zone proteins, we knocked TurboID into the endogenous elks-1 gene, which encodes a presynaptic active zone protein. We identified many known ELKS-1-interacting active zone proteins, as well as previously uncharacterized synaptic proteins. Versatile vectors and the inherent advantages of using C. elegans, including fast growth and the ability to rapidly make and functionally test knock-ins, make proximity labeling a valuable addition to the armory of this model organism.
PXD026683	34416270	Pregnancy is accompanied by larger high density lipoprotein particles and compositionally distinct subspecies. 	Impact of pregnancy on composition of human high density lipoproteins (SEC fractions)	HDL, Plasma, Pregnancy	Pregnancy is accompanied by significant physiological changes, which can impact the health and development of the fetus and mother. Pregnancy-induced changes in plasma lipoproteins are well documented, with modest to no impact observed on the generic measure of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, the impact of pregnancy on the concentration and composition of HDL subspecies has not been examined in depth. In this prospective study, we collected plasma from 24 nonpregnant and 19 pregnant women in their second trimester. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we quantified 11 different lipoprotein subspecies from plasma by size, including three in the HDL class. We observed an increase in the number of larger HDL particles in pregnant women, which were confirmed by tracking phospholipids across lipoproteins using high-resolution gel-filtration chromatography. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we identified 87 lipid-associated proteins across size-speciated fractions. We report drastic shifts in multiple protein clusters across different HDL size fractions in pregnant females compared with nonpregnant controls that have major implications on HDL function. These findings significantly elevate our understanding of how changes in lipoprotein metabolism during pregnancy could impact the health of both the fetus and the mother.
PXD024027	34416696	Inactivation efficacy and mechanism of pulsed corona discharge plasma on virus in water. 	Efficient inactivation of virus in water by damaging viral protein and genome using pulsed corona discharge plasma	Inactivation, pulsed corona discharge plasma, virus	The presence of viruses in water is a major risk for human and animal health due to their high resistance to disinfection. Pulsed corona discharge plasma (PCDP) efficiently inactivates bacteria by causing damage to biological macromolecules, but its effect on waterborne virus has not been reported. This study evaluated the inactivation efficacy of PCDP to viruses using spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) as a model. The results showed that 4-log10 reduction of SVCV infectivity in cells was reached after 120 s treatment, and there was no significant difference in survival of fish infected with SVCV inactivated by PCDP for 240 s or more longer compared to the control fish without virus challenge, thus confirming the feasibility of PCDP to waterborne virus inactivation. Moreover, the high input energy density caused by voltage significantly improved the inactivation efficiency. The further research indicated that reactive species (RS) generated by pulsed corona discharge firstly reacted with phosphoprotein (P) and polymerase complex proteins (L) through penetration into the SVCV virions, and then caused the loss of viral infectivity by damage to genome and other structural proteins. This study has significant implications for waterborne virus removal and development of novel disinfection technologies.
PXD026772	34416854	Investigation of cell wall proteins of C. sinensis leaves by combining cell wall proteomics and N-glycoproteomics. 	Investigation of cell wall proteins of Camellia sinensis leaves by combining cell wall proteomics and N-glycoproteomics	Camellia sinensis, cell wall proteins, leaves	BACKGROUND: C. sinensis is an important economic crop with fluoride over-accumulation in its leaves, which poses a serious threat to human health due to its leaf consumption as tea. Recently, our study has indicated that cell wall proteins (CWPs) probably play a vital role in fluoride accumulation/detoxification in C. sinensis. However, there has been a lack in CWP identification and characterization up to now. This study is aimed to characterize cell wall proteome of C. sinensis leaves and to develop more CWPs related to stress response. A strategy of combined cell wall proteomics and N-glycoproteomics was employed to investigate CWPs. CWPs were extracted by sequential salt buffers, while N-glycoproteins were enriched by hydrophilic interaction chromatography method using C. sinensis leaves as a material. Afterwards all the proteins were subjected to UPLC-MS/MS analysis. RESULTS: A total of 501 CWPs and 195 CWPs were identified respectively by cell wall proteomics and N-glycoproteomics profiling with 118 CWPs in common. Notably, N-glycoproteomics is a feasible method for CWP identification, and it can enhance CWP coverage. Among identified CWPs, proteins acting on cell wall polysaccharides constitute the largest functional class, most of which might be involved in cell wall structure remodeling. The second largest functional class mainly encompass various proteases related to CWP turnover and maturation. Oxidoreductases represent the third largest functional class, most of which (especially Class III peroxidases) participate in defense response. As expected, identified CWPs are mainly related to plant cell wall formation and defense response. CONCLUSION: This was the first large-scale investigation of CWPs in C. sinensis through cell wall proteomics and N-glycoproteomics. Our results not only provide a database for further research on CWPs, but also an insight into cell wall formation and defense response in C. sinensis.
PXD009612	34416891	Sodium valproate increases activity of the sirtuin pathway resulting in beneficial effects for spinocerebellar ataxia-3 in vivo. 	Sodium valproate is protective in a transgenic zebrafish model of Machado Joseph disease	ataxin-3, label-free quantitative proteomics, machado joseph disease, polyQ, zebrafish	Machado-Joseph disease (MJD, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that impairs control and coordination of movement. Here we tested whether treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium valproate (valproate) prevented a movement phenotype that develops in larvae of a transgenic zebrafish model of the disease. We found that treatment with valproate improved the swimming of the MJD zebrafish, affected levels of acetylated histones 3 and 4, but also increased expression of polyglutamine expanded human ataxin-3. Proteomic analysis of protein lysates generated from the treated and untreated MJD zebrafish also predicted that valproate treatment had activated the sirtuin longevity signaling pathway and this was confirmed by findings of increased SIRT1 protein levels and sirtuin activity in valproate treated MJD zebrafish and HEK293 cells expressing ataxin-3 84Q, respectively. Treatment with resveratrol (another compound known to activate the sirtuin pathway), also improved swimming in the MJD zebrafish. Co-treatment with valproate alongside EX527, a SIRT1 activity inhibitor, prevented induction of autophagy by valproate and the beneficial effects of valproate on the movement in the MJD zebrafish, supporting that they were both dependent on sirtuin activity. These findings provide the first evidence of sodium valproate inducing activation of the sirtuin pathway. Further, they indicate that drugs that target the sirtuin pathway, including sodium valproate and resveratrol, warrant further investigation for the treatment of MJD and related neurodegenerative diseases.
PXD022724	34417301	Wnt signaling recruits KIF2A to the spindle to ensure chromosome congression and alignment during mitosis. 	Wnt signaling recruits KIF2A to the spindle to ensure chromosome congression during mitosis	Dishevelled, KIF2A, Kinesin-13, PLK1, Wnt signaling, Wnt/STOP, chromosome congression, mitosis, stem cell	Canonical Wnt signaling plays critical roles in development and tissue renewal by regulating beta-catenin target genes. Recent evidence showed that beta-catenin-independent Wnt signaling is also required for faithful execution of mitosis. However, the targets and specific functions of mitotic Wnt signaling still remain uncharacterized. Using phosphoproteomics, we identified that Wnt signaling regulates the microtubule depolymerase KIF2A during mitosis. We found that Dishevelled recruits KIF2A via its N-terminal and motor domains, which is further promoted upon LRP6 signalosome formation during cell division. We show that Wnt signaling modulates KIF2A interaction with PLK1, which is critical for KIF2A localization at the spindle. Accordingly, inhibition of basal Wnt signaling leads to chromosome misalignment in somatic cells and pluripotent stem cells. We propose that Wnt signaling monitors KIF2A activity at the spindle poles during mitosis to ensure timely chromosome alignment. Our findings highlight a function of Wnt signaling during cell division, which could have important implications for genome maintenance, notably in stem cells.
PXD027150	34417450	Histone H4 lysine 20 mono-methylation directly facilitates chromatin openness and promotes transcription of housekeeping genes. 	MALDI-TOF Profiling of modified histone proteins	MALDI-TOF	Histone lysine methylations have primarily been linked to selective recruitment of reader or effector proteins that subsequently modify chromatin regions and mediate genome functions. Here, we describe a divergent role for histone H4 lysine 20 mono-methylation (H4K20me1) and demonstrate that it directly facilitates chromatin openness and accessibility by disrupting chromatin folding. Thus, accumulation of H4K20me1 demarcates highly accessible chromatin at genes, and this is maintained throughout the cell cycle. In vitro, H4K20me1-containing nucleosomal arrays with nucleosome repeat lengths (NRL) of 187 and 197 are less compact than unmethylated (H4K20me0) or trimethylated (H4K20me3) arrays. Concordantly, and in contrast to trimethylated and unmethylated tails, solid-state NMR data shows that H4K20 mono-methylation changes the H4 conformational state and leads to more dynamic histone H4-tails. Notably, the increased chromatin accessibility mediated by H4K20me1 facilitates gene expression, particularly of housekeeping genes. Altogether, we show how the methylation state of a single histone H4 residue operates as a focal point in chromatin structure control. While H4K20me1 directly promotes chromatin openness at highly transcribed genes, it also serves as a stepping-stone for H4K20me3-dependent chromatin compaction.
PXD025623	34418326	FNDC4 acts as an extracellular factor to promote the invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma partly via the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. 	Huh-7 Over-expression FNDC4 LC-MS	FNDC4, LC-MS, Liver cancer, ProteomeXchange project tag: Human Proteome Project	FNDC4 is highly homologous to the exercise-associated myokine FNDC5/irisin, which is highly expressed and promotes the invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. However, the function of FNDC4 remains unknown. Here, we report that FNDC4, an extracellular factor, plays important roles in the invasion and metastasis of HCC. We found that high FNDC4 expression is associated with poor survival in HCC patients and FNDC4 promotes the migration and invasion of HCC cells. Mechanistically, we found that FNDC4 is related to the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway to a certain extent. Specifically, the extracellular domain of FNDC4 acts as an extracellular factor to promote Akt phosphorylation levels in this pathway. These findings reveal that FNDC4 promotes the invasion and metastasis of HCC partly via the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.
PXD022861	34418567	IMProv: A Resource for Cross-link-Driven Structure Modeling that Accommodates Protein Dynamics. 	IMProv: A Resource for Crosslink-Driven Structure Modeling that Accommodates Protein Dynamics	crosslinking mass spectrometry, integrative modelling, software	Proteomics methodology has expanded to include protein structural analysis, primarily through cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HX-MS). However, while the structural proteomics community has effective tools for primary data analysis, there is a need for structure modeling pipelines that are accessible to the proteomics specialist. Integrative structural biology requires the aggregation of multiple distinct types of data to generate models that satisfy all inputs. Here, we describe IMProv, an app in the Mass Spec Studio that combines XL-MS data with other structural data, such as cryo-EM densities and crystallographic structures, for integrative structure modeling on high-performance computing platforms. The resource provides an easily deployed bundle that includes the open-source Integrative Modeling Platform program (IMP) and its dependencies. IMProv also provides functionality to adjust cross-link distance restraints according to the underlying dynamics of cross-linked sites, as characterized by HX-MS. A dynamics-driven conditioning of restraint values can improve structure modeling precision, as illustrated by an integrative structure of the five-membered Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. IMProv is extensible to additional types of data.
PXD024811	34418970	iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analysis of thoracic aortas from adult rats born to preeclamptic dams. 	iTRAQ-based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Thoracic Aortic from Adult Rats Born to Pre-eclamptic Mothers	Gamete and Embryo-Fetal Origins of Adult Diseases, Offspring, Preeclampsia, Thoracic aortic, iTRAQ	BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension can cause vascular function impairment in offspring. In our previous work, we described the protein expression profiles of umbilical artery tissues from patients with preeclampsia. METHODS: To gain insights into the mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in adult rats born to preeclamptic dams, we analyzed thoracic aorta tissues by using iTRAQ isobaric tags and 2D nano LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: By using the iTRAQ method, we analyzed 1825 proteins, of which 106 showed significantly different expression in the thoracic aortic. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed that the majority of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were associated with cardiovascular function. Further analysis indicated that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which is inhibited by miR-423-5p and activated by TP53, had the strongest effect on cardiovascular function. The expression of G6PD was upregulated in thoracic aorta tissues, as confirmed by Western blotting. The expression of two other vascular function-related proteins, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) and tubulin alpha-4 A (TUBA4A), was upregulated, as demonstrated by mass spectrometry (MS). CONCLUSIONS: Although the results require further functional validation, these data provide novel findings related to vascular function impairment in the adult offspring of preeclamptic mothers.
PXD024168	34420308	Proximity Labeling, Quantitative Proteomics, and Biochemical Studies Revealed the Molecular Mechanism for the Inhibitory Effect of Indisulam on the Proliferation of Gastric Cancer Cells. 	Identification of indisulam-mediated DCAF15 interacting proteins by TurboID and shotgun proteomics	AGS, DCAF15, Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, TurboID	Indisulam exhibits antitumor activity against several cancer cells. Although the DCAF15-indisulam-RBM39 axis has been well documented in the inhibition of cancer cell growth, it is unknown whether RBM39 degradation alone is the mechanism of action of indisulam. Here, we verified the inhibitory effect of indisulam on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells and its dependence on DCAF15. Proximity-dependent biotin labeling with TurboID and quantitative proteomics revealed that indisulam indeed promoted the interaction between DCAF15 and RBM39. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence also revealed that indisulam promoted the ubiquitin-mediated RBM39 degradation and RBM39 colocalized with DCAF15 in the nucleus. DCAF15 knockdown almost completely abolished the indisulam-mediated RBM39 reduction. Further knockdown of RBM39 eliminated the effect of DCAF15 on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells upon indisulam treatment. Immunoblotting of gastric tumor tissues confirmed the downregulation of RBM39 by indisulam. Database analysis unveiled that RBM39 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and its high expression significantly shortened the survival time of gastric cancer patients. Taken together, we demonstrated that indisulam enhanced RBM39 ubiquitination and degradation by promoting its interaction with DCAF15, thus inhibiting the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. This work may provide valuable information for drug discovery through proteolysis targeting chimeras. MS data were deposited in ProteomeXchange (Dataset identifier: PXD024168).
PXD023937	34420933	Proteomic characterization of secretory granules in dopaminergic neurons indicates chromogranin/secretogranin-mediated protein processing impairment in Parkinson's disease. 	Proteomic analysis of secretory granules in dopaminergic neurons of Parkinson`s disease	Parkinson`s disease, secretory granule, vesicle transport	Parkinson's disease (PD) is an aging disorder related to vesicle transport dysfunctions and neurotransmitter secretion. Secretory granules (SGs) are large dense-core vesicles for the biosynthesis of neuropeptides and hormones. At present, the involvement of SGs impairment in PD remains unclear. In the current study, we found that the number of SGs in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and the marker proteins secretogranin III (Scg3) significantly decreased in the substantia nigra and striatum regions of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) exposed mice. Proteomic study of SGs purified from the dopaminergic SH-sy5Y cells under 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) treatments (ProteomeXchange PXD023937) identified 536 significantly differentially expressed proteins. The result indicated that disabled lysosome and peroxisome, lipid and energy metabolism disorders are three characteristic features. Protein-protein interaction analysis of 56 secretory proteins and 140 secreted proteins suggested that the peptide processing mediated by chromogranin/secretogranin in SGs was remarkably compromised, accompanied by decreased candidate proteins and peptides neurosecretory protein (VGF), neuropeptide Y, apolipoprotein E, and an increased level of proenkephalin. The current study provided an extensive proteinogram of SGs in PD. It is helpful to understand the molecular mechanisms in the disease.
PXD020912	34421834	'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' Multimeric LotP Mediates Citrus sinensis Defense Response Activation. 	Citrus sinensis challenged with LotP	Citrus	'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' is known as the most pathogenic organism associated with citrus greening disease. Since its publicized emergence in Florida in 2005, 'Ca. L. asiaticus' remains unculturable. Currently, a limited number of potential disease effectors have been identified through in silico analysis. Therefore, these potential effectors remain poorly characterized and do not fully explain the complexity of symptoms observed in citrus trees infected with 'Ca. L. asiaticus.' LotP has been identified as a potential effector and have been partially characterized. This protein retains structural homology to the substrate binding domain of the Lon protease. LotP interacts with chaperones like GroEL, Hsp40, DnaJ, and ClpX and may exercise its biological role through interactions with different proteins involved in proteostasis networks. Here, we evaluate the interactome of LotP-revealing a new protein-protein interaction target (Lon-serine protease) and its effect on citrus plant tissue integrity. We found that via protein-protein interactions, LotP can enhance Lon protease activity, increasing the degradation rate of its specific targets. Infiltration of purified LotP strained citrus plant tissue causing photoinhibition and chlorosis after several days. Proteomics analysis of LotP tissues recovering after the infiltration revealed a large abundance of plant proteins associated with the stabilization and processing of mRNA transcripts, a subset of important transcription factors; and pathways associated with innate plant defense were highly expressed. Furthermore, interactions and substrate binding module of LotP suggest potential interactions with plant proteins, most likely proteases.
PXD025914	34421945	Study of Terpenoid Synthesis and Prenyltransferase in Roots of Rehmannia glutinosa Based on iTRAQ Quantitative Proteomics. 	Comparative proteomic analysis of root tubers of Rehmannia glutinosa at different growth stages	Rehmannia glutinosa, Root, three different growth stages	Rehmannia glutinosa has important medicinal value; terpenoid is one of the main active components in R. glutinosa. In this study, iTRAQ technique was used to analyze the relative abundance of proteins in roots of R. glutinosa, and 6,752 reliable proteins were quantified. GO enrichment results indicated that most proteins were involved in metabolic process or cellular process, 57.63% proteins had catalytic activity, and 65.80% proteins were enriched in membrane-bounded organelle. In roots of R. glutinosa, there were 38 KEGG enrichments with significance, more DEPs were found in some pathways, especially the proteasome pathway and TCA cycle with 15.0% DEPs between elongation stage and expansion stage of roots. Furthermore, five KEGG pathways of terpenoid synthesis were found. Most prenyltransferases belong to FPP/GGPP synthase family, involved in terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, and all interacted with biotin carboxylase CAC2. Compared with that at the elongation stage, many prenyltransferases exhibited higher expression at the expansion stage or maturation stage of roots. In addition, eight FPP/GGPP synthase encoding genes were cloned from R. glutinosa, namely FPPS, FPPS1, GGPS, GGPS3, GGPS4, GGPS5, GPPS and GPPS2, introns were also found in FPPS, FPPS1, GGPS5 and GGPS2, and FPP/GPP synthases were more conservative in organisms, especially in viridiplantae, in which the co-occurrence of GPPS or GPPS2 was significantly higher in plants. Further analysis found that FPP/GGPP synthases of R. glutinosa were divided into three kinds, GGPS, GPPS and FPPS, and their gene expression was significantly diverse in different varieties, growth periods, or tissues of R. glutinosa. Compared with that of GGPS, the expression of GPPS and FPPS was much higher in R. glutinosa, especially at the expansion stage and maturation stage. Thus, the synthesis of terpenoids in roots of R. glutinosa is intricately regulated and needs to be further studied.
PXD025320	34422946	The Proteome of Equine Oviductal Fluid Varies Before and After Ovulation: A Comparative Study. 	The proteome of equine oviductal fluid varies before and after ovulation: a comparative study	horse, oviductal fluid, ovulation	Equine fertilization cannot be performed in the laboratory as equine spermatozoa do not cross the oocyte's zona pellucida in vitro. Hence, a more profound study of equine oviductal fluid (OF) composition at the pre-ovulatory and post-ovulatory stages could help in understanding what components are required to achieve fertilization in horses. Our work aimed to elucidate the proteomic composition of equine OF at both stages. To do this, OF was obtained postmortem from oviducts of slaughtered mares ipsilateral to a pre-ovulatory follicle (n = 4) or a recent ovulation (n = 4); the samples were kept at -80degreesC until analysis. After protein extraction and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling, the samples were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The analysis of the spectra resulted in the identification of a total of 1,173 proteins present in pre-ovulatory and post-ovulatory samples; among these, 691 were unique for Equus caballus. Proteins from post-ovulatory oviductal fluid were compared with the proteins from pre-ovulatory oviductal fluid and were categorized as upregulated (positive log fold change) or downregulated (negative log fold change). Fifteen proteins were found to be downregulated in the post-ovulatory fluid and 156 were upregulated in the post-ovulatory OF compared to the pre-ovulatory fluid; among the upregulated proteins, 87 were included in the metabolism of proteins pathway. The identified proteins were related to sperm-oviduct interaction, fertilization, and metabolism, among others. Our data reveal consistent differences in the proteome of equine OF prior to and after ovulation, helping to increase our understanding in the factors that promote fertilization and early embryo development in horses.
PXD026095	34423991	The Human and Mouse Islet Peptidome: Effects of Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes, and Assessment of Intraislet Production of Glucagon-like Peptide-1. 	The human and mouse islet peptidome: effects of obesity and type 2 diabetes	glucagon, insulin, islets, peptidomics, type 2 diabetes	To characterize the impact of metabolic disease on the peptidome of human and mouse pancreatic islets, LC-MS was used to analyze extracts of human and mouse islets, purified mouse alpha, beta, and delta cells, supernatants from mouse islet incubations, and plasma from patients with type 2 diabetes. Islets were obtained from healthy and type 2 diabetic human donors, and mice on chow or high fat diet. All major islet hormones were detected in lysed islets as well as numerous peptides from vesicular proteins including granins and processing enzymes. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) was not detectable. High fat diet modestly increased islet content of proinsulin-derived peptides in mice. Human diabetic islets contained increased content of proglucagon-derived peptides at the expense of insulin, but no evident prohormone processing defects. Diabetic plasma, however, contained increased ratios of proinsulin and des-31,32-proinsulin to insulin. Active GLP-1 was detectable in human and mouse islets but 100-1000-fold less abundant than glucagon. LC-MS offers advantages over antibody-based approaches for identifying exact peptide sequences, and revealed a shift toward islet insulin production in high fat fed mice, and toward proglucagon production in type 2 diabetes, with no evidence of systematic defective prohormone processing.
PXD024007	34424674	Enhanced Secretions of Algal Cell-Adhesion Molecules and Metal Ion-Binding Exoproteins Promote Self-Flocculation of Chlorella sp. Cultivated in Municipal Wastewater. 	Mechanism behind microalgal self-flocculation	exoprotein, microalgae	The mechanism of self-flocculation remains unclear, partially impeding its efficiency enhancement and commercial application of microalgae-based municipal wastewater (MW) bioremediation technology. This study revealed the contributions of exoproteins [PN, proteins in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)] to the separation of indigenous microalgae from treated MW. Compared to the low light intensity group, the high light intensity (HL) group produced Chlorella sp. with 4.3-fold higher self-flocculation efficiencies (SE). This was attributed to the enriched biological functions and positional rearrangement of increased PN within 2.9-fold higher EPS. Specifically, a total of 75 PN was over-expressed in the HL group among the 129 PN identified through label-free proteomics. The algal cell-adhesion molecules (Algal-CAMs) and metal-ion-binding PN were demonstrated as two dominant contributors promoting cell adhesion and bridging, through function prediction based on the contained domains. The modeled 3D structure showed that Algal-CAMs presented less hydrophilic alpha-helix abundance and were distributed in the outermost position of the EPS matrix, further facilitating microalgal separation. Moreover, the 10.1% lower hydrophily degree value, negative interfacial free energy (-19.5 mJ/m(2)), and 6.8-fold lower energy barrier between cells also supported the observed higher SE. This finding is expected to further fill the knowledge gap of the role of PN in microalgal self-flocculation and promote the development of biomass recovery from the microalgae-wastewater system.
PXD024229	34424714	Associations between Cellular Energy and Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patient Response to Treatment. 	Associations between cellular energy and pediatric inflammatory bowel disease patient response to treatment	Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Pediatric	Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, are chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, with an unknown etiology, that affect over 6.8 million people worldwide. To characterize disease pathogenesis, proteomic and bioinformatic analyses were performed on colon biopsies collected during diagnostic endoscopy from 119 treatment-naive pediatric patients, including from 78 IBD patients and 41 non-IBD patients who served as controls. Due to the presence of noninflamed and/or inflamed regions in IBD patients, up to two biopsies were obtained from IBD patients as compared to a single noninflamed biopsy from non-IBD pediatric control patients. Additional biopsies were obtained and analyzed from 33 of the IBD patients after IBD-directed therapeutic intervention for comparison of pre- and post-treatment proteomes. SuperSILAC was utilized to perform quantitative analysis of homogenized tissues, which were processed by filter-aided sample preparation. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses revealed proteomic patterns that distinguished inflamed from noninflamed tissues independent of therapy. Gene ontology revealed that proteins downregulated in inflammation are associated with metabolism, whereas upregulated proteins contribute to protein processing. A comparison of pre- and post-treatment proteomes from CD patients identified over 100 proteins that are significantly different between patients who responded and those who did not respond to therapy, including creatine kinase B and basigin.
PXD026906	34424905	Proteomic analysis of serum samples of paracoccidioidomycosis patients with severe pulmonary sequel. 	Proteomic analysis of serum samples of paracoccidioidomycosis patients with severe pulmonary sequel	Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, molecular analysis, pulmonary fibrosis	BACKGROUND: Pulmonary sequelae (PS) in patients with chronic paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) typically include pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. Knowledge of the molecular pathways involved in PS of PCM is required for treatment and biomarker identification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This non-concurrent cohort study included 29 patients with pulmonary PCM that were followed before and after treatment. From this group, 17 patients evolved to mild/ moderate PS and 12 evolved severe PS. Sera from patients were evaluated before treatment and at clinical cure, serological cure, and apparent cure. A nanoACQUITY UPLC-Xevo QT MS system and PLGS software were used to identify serum differentially expressed proteins, data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026906. Serum differentially expressed proteins were then categorized using Cytoscape software and the Reactome pathway database. Seventy-two differentially expressed serum proteins were identified in patients with severe PS compared with patients with mild/moderate PS. Most proteins altered in severe PS were involved in wound healing, inflammatory response, and oxygen transport pathways. Before treatment and at clinical cure, signaling proteins participating in wound healing, complement cascade, cholesterol transport and retinoid metabolism pathways were downregulated in patients with severe PS, whereas signaling proteins in gluconeogenesis and gas exchange pathways were upregulated. At serological cure, the pattern of protein expression reversed. At apparent cure pathways related with tissue repair (fibrosis) became downregulated, and pathway related oxygen transport became upregulated. Additionally, we identified 15 proteins as candidate biomarkers for severe PS. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Development of severe PS is related to increased expression of proteins involved in glycolytic pathway and oxygen exchange), indicative of the greater cellular activity and replication associated with early dysregulation of wound healing and aberrant tissue repair. Our findings provide new targets to study mechanisms of PS in PCM, as well as potential biomarkers.
PXD027031	34425106	A fully reversible 25-hydroxy steroid kinase involved in oxygen-independent cholesterol side-chain oxidation. 	Wild type enrichment of a 25-phospho-steroid kinase involved in anaerobic steroid degradation	Steroid degradation, cholesterol, kinase	The degradation of cholesterol and related steroids by microbes follows fundamentally different strategies in aerobic and anaerobic environments. In anaerobic bacteria, the primary C26 of the isoprenoid side chain is hydroxylated without oxygen via a three-step cascade: (i) water-dependent hydroxylation at the tertiary C25, (ii) ATP-dependent dehydration to form a subterminal alkene, and (iii) water-dependent hydroxylation at the primary C26 to form an allylic alcohol. However, the enzymes involved in the ATP-dependent dehydration have remained unknown. Here, we isolated an ATP-dependent 25-hydroxy-steroid kinase (25-HSK) from the anaerobic bacterium Sterolibacterium denitrificans. This highly active enzyme preferentially phosphorylated the tertiary C25 of steroid alcohols, including metabolites of cholesterol and sitosterol degradation or 25-OH-vitamin D3. Kinetic data were in agreement with a sequential mechanism via a ternary complex. Remarkably, 25-HSK readily catalyzed the formation of gamma-((18)O)2-ATP from ADP and the C25-((18)O)2-phosphoester. The observed full reversibility of 25-HSK with an equilibrium constant below one can be rationalized by an unusual high phosphoryl transfer potential of tertiary steroid C25-phosphoesters, which is =~20 kJ mol(-1) higher than that of standard sugar phosphoesters and even slightly greater than the beta,gamma-phosphoanhydride of ATP. In summary, 25-HSK plays an essential role in anaerobic bacterial degradation of zoo- and phytosterols and shows only little similarity to known phosphotransferases.
PXD023766	34425157	Comparative Proteomics of Rat Olfactory Bulb Reveal Insights into Susceptibility and Resiliency to Chronic-stress-induced Depression or Anxiety. 	Olfactory bulb proteomics of CMS-treated rats	anxiety, chronic mild stress, depression, olfactory bulb	Chronic stress causes the abnormality of olfactory bulb (OB) in both anxiety and depression, however, the unique and common neurobiological underpinnings are still poorly understood. Previously, we built the three groups by chronic mild stress (CMS), depression-susceptible (Dep-Sus): with depression-like behavior, anxiety-susceptible (Anx-Sus): with anxiety-like behavior and insusceptible (Insus): without depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. To continuously explore the protein expression changes in these three groups, comparative quantitative proteomics analysis was conducted on the rat OB as crucial part of the olfactory system. Next, bioinformatics analyses were implemented whereas protein expressions were independently analyzed by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) or Western blot (WB). The OB-proteome analysis identified totally 133 differentially expressed proteins as a CMS response. These deregulated proteins were involved in multiple functions and significant pathways potentially correlated with phenotypes of maladaptive behavior of depression or anxiety as well as adaptive behavior, and hence might act as potential candidate protein targets. The subsequent PRM-based or WB-based analyses showed that changes in Nefl, Mtmr7 and Tk2; Prkaca, Coa3, Cox6c2, Lamc1 and Tubal3; and Pabpn1, Nme3, Sos1 and Lum were uniquely associated with Dep-Sus, Anx-Sus, and Insus groups, respectively. These phenotype-specific deregulated proteins were primarily involved in multiple metabolic and signaling pathways, suggesting that the identical CMS differently impacted the olfactory protein regulation system and biological processes. To sum up, our present data as a useful proteomics underpinning provided the common and distinct molecular insights into the biochemical understanding of OB dysfunction underlying susceptibility and resiliency to chronic-stress-induced anxiety or depression.
PXD020832	34425286	Compound deletion of thrombospondin-1 and -2 results in a skeletal phenotype not predicted by the single gene knockouts. 	Compound Deletion of Thrombospondin-1 and -2 Results in a Skeletal Phenotype not Predicted by the Single Gene Knockouts	Thrombospondins, bone, osteoblasts, osteoclasts	The trimeric thrombospondin homologs, TSP1 and TSP2, are both components of bone tissue and contribute in redundant and distinct ways to skeletal physiology. TSP1-null mice display increased femoral cross-sectional area and thickness due to periosteal expansion, as well as diminished matrix quality and impaired osteoclast function. TSP2-null mice display increased femoral cross-sectional thickness and reduced marrow area due to increased endosteal osteoblast activity, with very little periosteal expansion. Osteoblast lineage cells are reduced in TSP2-null mice, but not in TSP1-null. The functional effects of combined TSP1 and TSP2 deficiency remain to be elucidated. Here, we examined the spectrum of detergent soluble proteins in diaphyseal cortical bone of growing (6-week old) male and female mice deficient in both thrombospondins (double knockout (DKO)). Of 3429 detected proteins, 195 were differentially abundant in both male and female DKO bones. Physiologically relevant annotation terms identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis included "ECM degradation" and "Quantity of Monocytes." Manual inspection revealed that a number of proteins with shared expression among osteoclasts and osteocytes were reduced in DKO bones. To associate changes in protein content with phenotype, we examined 12-week old male and female DKO and WT mice. DKO mice were smaller than WT and in male DKO, femoral cross section area was reduced. Some of the male DKO femora also had a flattened, less circular cross-section. Male DKO bones were less stiff in bending and they displayed reduced ultimate load. Displacements at yield load and at max load were both elevated in male DKO. However, the ratios of post-yield to pre-yield displacements significantly diminished in DKO suggesting proportionally reduced post-yield behavior. Male DKO mice also exhibited reductions in trabecular bone mass, which were surprisingly associated with equivalent osteoblast numbers and accordingly increased osteoblast surface. Marrow-derived colony forming unit-fibroblastic was reduced in male and female DKO mice. Together our data suggest that when both TSP1 and TSP2 are absent, a unique, sex-specific bone phenotype not predicted by the single knockouts, is manifested.
PXD021665	34425919	Importance of extracellular vesicle secretion at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid interface in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. 	Importance of choroid plexus-mediated extracellular vesicle secretion in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease	Alzheimer, AbetaO, CSF, EV, choroid plexus	Increasing evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously reported that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface, formed by the choroid plexus epithelial (CPE) cells, releases an increased amount of EVs into the CSF in response to peripheral inflammation. Here, we studied the importance of CP-mediated EV release in AD pathogenesis. We observed increased EV levels in the CSF of young transgenic APP/PS1 mice which correlated with high amyloid beta (Abeta) CSF levels at this age. The intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of Abeta oligomers (AbetaO) in wild-type mice revealed a significant increase of EVs in the CSF, signifying that the presence of CSF-AbetaO is sufficient to induce increased EV secretion. Using in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo approaches, we identified the CP as a major source of the CSF-EVs. Interestingly, AbetaO-induced, CP-derived EVs induced pro-inflammatory effects in mixed cortical cultures. Proteome analysis of these EVs revealed the presence of several pro-inflammatory proteins, including the complement protein C3. Strikingly, inhibition of EV production using GW4869 resulted in protection against acute AbetaO-induced cognitive decline. Further research into the underlying mechanisms of this EV secretion might open up novel therapeutic strategies to impact the pathogenesis and progression of AD.
PXD026767	34427507	Comparative Molecular and Immunoregulatory Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles from Candida albicans and Candida auris. 	Proteomics analysis of Candida albicans 90028 extracellular vesicles	Candida albicans, extracellular vesicles	Candida auris is a recently described multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungus that is increasingly responsible for health care-associated outbreaks across the world. Bloodstream infections of this fungus cause death in up to 70% of cases. Aggravating this scenario, the disease-promoting mechanisms of C. auris are poorly understood. Fungi release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that carry a broad range of molecules, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, pigments, and RNA, many of which are virulence factors. Here, we carried out a comparative molecular characterization of C. auris and Candida albicans EVs and evaluated their capacity to modulate effector mechanisms of host immune defense. Using proteomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics, we found that C. auris released EVs with payloads that were significantly different from those of EVs released by C. albicans. EVs released by C. auris potentiated the adhesion of this yeast to an epithelial cell monolayer, while EVs from C. albicans had no effect. C. albicans EVs primed macrophages for enhanced intracellular yeast killing, whereas C. auris EVs promoted survival of the fungal cells. Moreover, EVs from both C. auris and C. albicans induced the activation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Together, our findings show distinct profiles and properties of EVs released by C. auris and by C. albicans and highlight the potential contribution of C. auris EVs to the pathogenesis of this emerging pathogen. IMPORTANCE Candida auris is a recently described multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungus that is responsible for outbreaks across the globe, particularly in the context of nosocomial infections. Its virulence factors and pathogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by C. auris are a disease-promoting factor. We describe the production of EVs by C. auris and compare their biological activities against those of the better-characterized EVs from C. albicans. C. auris EVs have immunoregulatory properties, of which some are opposite those of C. albicans EVs. We also explored the cargo and structural components of those vesicles and found that they are remarkably distinct compared to EVs from C. auris's phylogenetic relative Candida albicans.
PXD027494	34427634	Translational regulation in the brain by TDP-43 phase separation. 	Identify the specific binding partners of cytosolic TDP-43 WT and TDP-43Î”CR	TDP-43, cytosolic binding partners, human cells	The in vivo physiological function of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) that governs non-membrane-bound structures remains elusive. Among LLPS-prone proteins, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kD (TDP-43) is under intense investigation because of its close association with neurological disorders. Here, we generated mice expressing endogenous LLPS-deficient murine TDP-43. LLPS-deficient TDP-43 mice demonstrate impaired neuronal function and behavioral abnormalities specifically related to brain function. Brain neurons of these mice, however, did not show TDP-43 proteinopathy or neurodegeneration. Instead, the global rate of protein synthesis was found to be greatly enhanced by TDP-43 LLPS loss. Mechanistically, TDP-43 LLPS ablation increased its association with PABPC4, RPS6, RPL7, and other translational factors. The physical interactions between TDP-43 and translational factors relies on a motif, the deletion of which abolished the impact of LLPS-deficient TDP-43 on translation. Our findings show a specific physiological role for TDP-43 LLPS in the regulation of brain function and uncover an intriguing novel molecular mechanism of translational control by LLPS.
PXD010474	34428048	Proximity-Dependent Biotinylation to Elucidate the Interactome of TNK2 Nonreceptor Tyrosine Kinase. 	Proximity-dependent biotinylation to elucidate the interactome of TNK2 non-receptor tyrosine kinase	BioID, BioSITe, ProteomeXchange project tag: Breast Cancer, TNK2	Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) represent an important class of signaling molecules driving diverse cellular pathways. Aberrant expression and hyperphosphorylation of TNK2, an NRTK, have been implicated in multiple cancers. However, the exact proteins and cellular events that mediate phenotypic changes downstream of TNK2 are unclear. Biological systems that employ proximity-dependent biotinylation methods, such as BioID, are being increasingly used to map protein-protein interactions, as they provide increased sensitivity in discovering interaction partners. In this study, we employed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture and BioID coupled to the biotinylation site identification technology (BioSITe) method that we recently developed to quantitatively explore the interactome of TNK2. By performing a controlled comparative analysis between full-length TNK2 and its truncated counterpart, we were able to not only identify site-level biotinylation of previously well-established TNK2 binders and substrates including NCK1, NCK2, CTTN, and STAT3, but also discover several novel TNK2 interacting partners. We also performed co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analysis to validate the interaction between TNK2 and CLINT1, a novel TNK2 interacting protein. Overall, this work reveals the power of the BioSITe method coupled to BioID and highlights several molecules that warrant further exploration to assess their functional significance in TNK2-mediated signaling.
PXD020178	34428663	Nanomaterials induce different levels of oxidative stress, depending on the used model system: Comparison of in vitro and in vivo effects. 	NanoToxClass: Investigation of dose-dependent nanomaterial effects after short-term inhalation studies (STIS) with rats	NanoToxClass, Nanomaterials, Rat, STIS, TMT	The immense diversity and constant development of nanomaterials (NMs) increase the need for a facilitated risk assessment, which requires knowledge of the modes of action (MoAs) of NMs. This necessitates a comprehensive data basis, which can be obtained using omics. Furthermore, the establishment of suitable in vitro test systems is essential to follow the 3R concept and to cope with the high number of NMs. In the present study, we aimed to compare NM effects in vitro and in vivo using a multi-omics approach. We applied an integrated data analysis strategy based on proteomics and metabolomics to four silica NMs and one titanium dioxide-based NM. For the in vitro investigations, rat alveolar epithelial cells (RLE-6TN) and rat alveolar macrophages (NR8383) were treated with different doses of NMs, and the results were compared with the effects on rat lungs after short-term inhalations and instillations. Since reactive oxygen species (ROS) production has been described as a critical biological effect of NMs, we focused on different levels of oxidative stress. Thus, we found opposite changes in proteins and metabolites related to the production of reduced glutathione in alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, demonstrating that the MoAs of NMs depend on the model system used. Interestingly, in vivo, pathways related to inflammation were more affected than oxidative stress responses. Hence, the assignment of the observed effects to levels of oxidative stress was also different in vitro and in vivo. However, the overall classification of "active" and "passive" NMs was consistent in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that both cell lines tested are suitable for the assessment of NM toxicity. In summary, the results presented here highlight the need to carefully review model systems to decipher the extent to which they can replace in vivo assays.
PXD027485	34429344	Serum proteomics reveals disorder of lipoprotein metabolism in sepsis. 	Serum proteomics data of sepsis	biomarkers, sepsis	Sepsis is defined as an organ dysfunction syndrome and it has high mortality worldwide. This study analysed the proteome of serum from patients with sepsis to characterize the pathological mechanism and pathways involved in sepsis. A total of 59 patients with sepsis were enrolled for quantitative proteomic analysis. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to construct a co-expression network specific to sepsis. Key regulatory modules that were detected were highly correlated with sepsis patients and related to multiple functional groups, including plasma lipoprotein particle remodeling, inflammatory response, and wound healing. Complement activation was significantly associated with sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Triglyceride/cholesterol homeostasis was found to be related to sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. Twelve hub proteins were identified, which might be predictive biomarkers of sepsis. External validation of the hub proteins showed their significantly differential expression in sepsis patients. This study identified that plasma lipoprotein processes played a crucial role in sepsis patients, that complement activation contributed to sepsis-associated encephalopathy, and that triglyceride/cholesterol homeostasis was associated with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.
PXD018304	34429501	Multi-layered proteogenomic analysis unravels cancer metastasis directed by MMP-2 and focal adhesion kinase signaling. 	Multi-layered proteomic analysis for colorectal cancer	MMP-2, SILAC, colorectal cancer, focal adhesion kinase, label-free, plasma, secretome	The role of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in tumor cell migration has been widely studied, however, the characteristics and effects of MMP-2 in clinical sample of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) remain poorly understood. Here, in order to unveil the perturbed proteomic signal during MMP-2 induced cancer progression, we analyzed plasma proteome of CRC patients according to disease progression, HCT116 cancer secretome upon MMP-2 knockdown, and publicly available CRC tissue proteome data. Collectively, the integrative analysis of multi-layered proteomes revealed that a protein cluster containing EMT (Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition)-associated proteins such as CD9-integrin as well as MMP-2. The proteins of the cluster were regulated by MMP-2 perturbation and exhibited significantly increased expressions in tissue and plasma as disease progressed from TNM (Tumor, Node, and Metastasis) stage I to II. Furthermore, we also identified a plausible association between MMP-2 up-regulation and activation of focal adhesion kinase signaling in the proteogenomic analysis of CRC patient tissues. Based on these comparative and integrative analyses, we suggest that the high invasiveness in the metastatic CRC resulted from increased secretion of MMP-2 and CD9-integrin complex mediated by FAK signaling activation.
PXD023001	34429857	Robust sequential biophysical fractionation of blood plasma to study variations in the biomolecular landscape of systemically circulating extracellular vesicles across clinical conditions. 	Assessing the biomolecular landscape and dynamics of systemically circulating lipid-carrying particles	Cancer, Extracellular Vesicles, HIV	Separating extracellular vesicles (EV) from blood plasma is challenging and complicates their biological understanding and biomarker development. In this study, we fractionate blood plasma by combining size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation to study clinical context-dependent and time-dependent variations in the biomolecular landscape of systemically circulating EV. Using pooled blood plasma samples from breast cancer patients, we first demonstrate the technical repeatability of blood plasma fractionation. Using serial blood plasma samples from HIV and ovarian cancer patients (n = 10) we next show that EV carry a clinical context-dependent and/or time-dependent protein and small RNA composition, including miRNA and tRNA. In addition, differential analysis of blood plasma fractions provides a catalogue of putative proteins not associated with systemically circulating EV. In conclusion, the implementation of blood plasma fractionation allows to advance the biological understanding and biomarker development of systemically circulating EV.
PXD027400	34431785	HBO1-MLL interaction promotes AF4/ENL/P-TEFb-mediated leukemogenesis. 	Proteome analysis of affinity-purified protein co-precipitates	HB1119, HEK293T, affinity-purified materials	Leukemic oncoproteins cause uncontrolled self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors by aberrant gene activation, eventually causing leukemia. However, the molecular mechanism underlying aberrant gene activation remains elusive. Here, we showed that leukemic MLL fusion proteins associate with the HBO1 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex through their trithorax homology domain 2 (THD2) in various human cell lines. MLL proteins associated with the HBO1 complex through multiple contacts mediated mainly by the ING4/5 and PHF16 subunits in a chromatin-bound context where histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation marks were present. Of the many MLL fusions, MLL-ELL particularly depended on the THD2-mediated association with the HBO1 complex for leukemic transformation. The C-terminal portion of ELL provided a binding platform for multiple factors including AF4, EAF1, and p53. MLL-ELL activated gene expression in murine hematopoietic progenitors by loading an AF4/ENL/P-TEFb (AEP) complex onto the target promoters wherein the HBO1 complex promoted the association with AEP complex over EAF1 and p53. Moreover, the NUP98-HBO1 fusion protein exerted its oncogenic properties via interaction with MLL but not its intrinsic HAT activity. Thus, the interaction between the HBO1 complex and MLL is an important nexus in leukemic transformation, which may serve as a therapeutic target for drug development.
PXD016599	34432360	CLN6 deficiency causes selective changes in the lysosomal protein composition. 	CLN6 deficiency causes selective changes in the lysosomal protein composition	Cln6, lysosome, nclf	Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) collectively account for the highest prevalence of inherited neurodegenerative diseases in childhood. This disease group is classified by the deposition of similar autofluorescence storage material in lysosomes that is accompanied by seizures, blindness and premature mortality in later disease stages. Defects in several genes affecting various proteins lead to NCL, one of them being CLN6, a transmembrane protein resident in the endoplasmic reticulum. Dysfunctionality of CLN6 causes variant late infantile NCL (vLINCL). The function of CLN6 and how its deficiency affects lysosomal integrity remains unknown. In this work, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of isolated lysosomal fractions from liver tissue of nclf mice, a natural mouse model displaying a similar disease course than its human counterpart. We could identify a drastic reduction in the protein amounts of selected lysosomal proteins, amongst them several members of the NCL protein family. Most of these proteins were N-glycosylated, soluble hydrolases and their reduction in protein levels was verified by western blotting and enzymatic assays. Hereby we could directly link Cln6 dysfunction to changes in the lysosomal compartment and to other NCL forms.
PXD007769	34432535	How to Achieve Therapeutic Response in Erlotinib-Resistant Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma? New Insights from Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture-Based Quantitative Tyrosine Phosphoproteomics. 	SILAC-based quantitative tyrosine phosphoproteomic profiling identifies alternative therapeutic targets to erlotinib in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, head and neck cancer, quantitative proteomics, signaling pathways	Resistance to cancer chemotherapy is a major global health burden. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a proven therapeutic target for multiple cancers of epithelial origin. Despite its overexpression in >90% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib have shown a modest response in clinical trials. Cellular heterogeneity is thought to play an important role in HNSCC therapeutic resistance. Genomic alterations alone cannot explain all resistance mechanisms at play in a heterogeneous system. It is thus important to understand the biochemical mechanisms associated with drug resistance to determine potential strategies to achieve clinical response. We investigated tyrosine kinase signaling networks in erlotinib-resistant cells using quantitative tyrosine phosphoproteomics approach. We observed altered phosphorylation of proteins involved in cell adhesion and motility in erlotinib-resistant cells. Bioinformatics analysis revealed enrichment of pathways related to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, and endothelial migration. Of importance, enrichment of the focal adhesion kinase (PTK2) signaling pathway downstream of EGFR was also observed in erlotinib-resistant cells. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first report of tyrosine phosphoproteome profiling in erlotinib-resistant HNSCC, with an eye to inform new ways to achieve clinical response. Our findings suggest that common signaling networks are at play in driving resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in HNSCC and other cancers. Most notably, our data suggest that the PTK2 pathway genes may potentially play a significant role in determining clinical response to erlotinib in HNSCC tumors.
PXD027108	34433037	Crosstalk between Drp1 phosphorylation sites during mitochondrial remodeling and their impact on metabolic adaptation. 	Crosstalk between Drp1 phosphorylations during mitochondrial remodelling and their impact on metabolic adaptation - Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry-based proteomic data	Drp1, PRM, Phosphorylation	Mitochondria constantly undergo fusion and fission events, referred as mitochondrial dynamics, which determine mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics. Cultured cell studies demonstrate that mitochondrial dynamics are acutely regulated by phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission orchestrator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) at S579 or S600. However, the physiological impact and crosstalk of these phosphorylation sites is poorly understood. Here, we describe the functional interrelation between S579 and S600 phosphorylation sites in vivo and their role on mitochondrial remodeling. Mice carrying a homozygous Drp1 S600A knockin (Drp1 KI) mutation display larger mitochondria and enhanced lipid oxidation and respiratory capacities, granting improved glucose tolerance and thermogenic response upon high-fat feeding. Housing mice at thermoneutrality blunts these differences, suggesting a role for the brown adipose tissue in the protection of Drp1 KI mice against metabolic damage. Overall, we demonstrate crosstalk between Drp1 phosphorylation sites and provide evidence that their modulation could be used in the treatment and prevention of metabolic diseases.
PXD025973	34433056	Skin exposure to UVB light induces a skin-brain-gonad axis and sexual behavior. 	Skin Exposure to UVB Light induces a Skin-Brain-Gonad Axis and Sexual Behavior	Sexual Behavior, UVB Light	Ultraviolet (UV) light affects endocrinological and behavioral aspects of sexuality via an unknown mechanism. Here we discover that ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure enhances the levels of sex-steroid hormones and sexual behavior, which are mediated by the skin. In female mice, UVB exposure increases hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis hormone levels, resulting in larger ovaries; extends estrus days; and increases anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) expression. UVB exposure also enhances the sexual responsiveness and attractiveness of females and male-female interactions. Conditional knockout of p53 specifically in skin keratinocytes abolishes the effects of UVB. Thus, UVB triggers a skin-brain-gonadal axis through skin p53 activation. In humans, solar exposure enhances romantic passion in both genders and aggressiveness in men, as seen in analysis of individual questionaries, and positively correlates with testosterone level. Our findings suggest opportunities for treatment of sex-steroid-related dysfunctions.
PXD024533	34433589	CD8(+) T-cell Immune Surveillance against a Tumor Antigen Encoded by the Oncogenic Long Noncoding RNA PVT1. 	HLA class I ligandome of colon cancer tissues for lncRNA antigen identification	HLA ligandome analysis, proteogenomics	CD8(+) T cells recognize peptides displayed by HLA class I molecules on cell surfaces, monitoring pathologic conditions such as cancer. Advances in proteogenomic analysis of HLA ligandomes have demonstrated that cells present a subset of cryptic peptides derived from noncoding regions of the genome; however, the roles of cryptic HLA ligands in tumor immunity remain unknown. In the current study, we comprehensively and quantitatively investigated the HLA class I ligandome of a set of human colorectal cancer and matched normal tissues, showing that cryptic translation products accounted for approximately 5% of the HLA class I ligandome. We also found that a peptide encoded by the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) PVT1 was predominantly enriched in multiple colorectal cancer tissues. The PVT1 gene is located downstream of the MYC gene in the genome and is aberrantly overexpressed across a variety of cancers, reflecting its oncogenic property. The PVT1 peptide was recognized by patient CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting the presence of patient immune surveillance. Our findings show that peptides can be translated from lncRNAs and presented by HLA class I and that cancer patient T cells are capable of sensing aberrations in noncoding regions of the genome.
PXD011938	34433641	Lithium preserves peritoneal membrane integrity by suppressing mesothelial cell alphaB-crystallin. 	2D gel-based proteomics of primary human peritoneal mesothelial cells derived from omentum	2D-DIGE, MALDI, Peritoneal Dialysis	Life-saving renal replacement therapy by peritoneal dialysis (PD) is limited in use and duration by progressive impairment of peritoneal membrane integrity and homeostasis. Preservation of peritoneal membrane integrity during chronic PD remains an urgent but long unmet medical need. PD therapy failure results from peritoneal fibrosis and angiogenesis caused by hypertonic PD fluid (PDF)-induced mesothelial cytotoxicity. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved are incompletely understood, limiting identification of therapeutic targets. We report that addition of lithium chloride (LiCl) to PDF is a translatable intervention to counteract PDF-induced mesothelial cell death, peritoneal membrane fibrosis, and angiogenesis. LiCl improved mesothelial cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of icodextrin-based PDF-induced mesothelial cell injury identified alphaB-crystallin as the mesothelial cell protein most consistently counter-regulated by LiCl. In vitro and in vivo overexpression of alphaB-crystallin triggered a fibrotic phenotype and PDF-like up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD31-positive cells, and TGF-beta-independent activation of TGF-beta-regulated targets. In contrast, alphaB-crystallin knockdown decreased VEGF expression and early mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. LiCl reduced VEGF release and counteracted fibrosis- and angiogenesis-associated processes. alphaB-crystallin in patient-derived mesothelial cells was specifically up-regulated in response to PDF and increased in peritoneal mesothelial cells from biopsies from pediatric patients undergoing PD, correlating with markers of angiogenesis and fibrosis. LiCl-supplemented PDF promoted morphological preservation of mesothelial cells and the submesothelial zone in a mouse model of chronic PD. Thus, repurposing LiCl as a cytoprotective PDF additive may offer a translatable therapeutic strategy to combat peritoneal membrane deterioration during PD therapy.
PXD026081	34433667	An in vitro vesicle formation assay reveals cargo clients and factors that mediate vesicular trafficking. 	Protein profiling of transport vesicles produced under different conditions	Arf, cargo adaptors, cargo proteins, coat proteins, vesicles	The fidelity of protein transport in the secretory pathway relies on the accurate sorting of proteins to their correct destinations. To deepen our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms, it is important to develop a robust approach to systematically reveal cargo proteins that depend on specific sorting machinery to be enriched into transport vesicles. Here, we used an in vitro assay that reconstitutes packaging of human cargo proteins into vesicles to quantify cargo capture. Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) analyses of the isolated vesicles revealed cytosolic proteins that are associated with vesicle membranes in a GTP-dependent manner. We found that two of them, FAM84B (also known as LRAT domain containing 2 or LRATD2) and PRRC1, contain proline-rich domains and regulate anterograde trafficking. Further analyses revealed that PRRC1 is recruited to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites, interacts with the inner COPII coat, and its absence increases membrane association of COPII. In addition, we uncovered cargo proteins that depend on GTP hydrolysis to be captured into vesicles. Comparing control cells with cells depleted of the cargo receptors, SURF4 or ERGIC53, we revealed specific clients of each of these two export adaptors. Our results indicate that the vesicle formation assay in combination with quantitative MS analysis is a robust and powerful tool to uncover novel factors that mediate vesicular trafficking and to uncover cargo clients of specific cellular factors.
PXD017458	34433823	Proteomic profiling dataset of chemical perturbations in multiple biological backgrounds. 	Phospho-proteomic Profiling Dataset of Chemical Perturbations in Multiple Biological Backgrounds	Data-Independent Acquisition, phospho-signaling, phosphoproteomics	While gene expression profiling has traditionally been the method of choice for large-scale perturbational profiling studies, proteomics has emerged as an effective tool in this context for directly monitoring cellular responses to perturbations. We previously reported a pilot library containing 3400 profiles of multiple perturbations across diverse cellular backgrounds in the reduced-representation phosphoproteome (P100) and chromatin space (Global Chromatin Profiling, GCP). Here, we expand our original dataset to include profiles from a new set of cardiotoxic compounds and from astrocytes, an additional neural cell model, totaling 5300 proteomic signatures. We describe filtering criteria and quality control metrics used to assess and validate the technical quality and reproducibility of our data. To demonstrate the power of the library, we present two case studies where data is queried using the concept of "connectivity" to obtain biological insight. All data presented in this study have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with identifiers PXD017458 (P100) and PXD017459 (GCP) and can be queried at https://clue.io/proteomics .
PXD019140	34434797	Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based proteomics of Escherichia coli single colony. 	Comparison between the proteome of Escherichia coli single colony and during liquid culture	Ecoli, Single-colony, bacterial proteome, protein extraction	The Escherichia coli proteome is the most extensively characterized and studied of all prokaryotic proteomes. Despite this, large scale bacterial proteomics experiments performed on E. coli cells grown in liquid cultures have failed to identify key virulence factors thought to be important determinants in establishing bacterial infections. It seems likely that many important determinants associated with virulence and host cell adhesion are exclusively expressed during growth in biofilms, which can be crudely mimicked on solid media. This method describes a simple workflow to characterize the unique proteome signature of individual, isolated single colonies, using E. coli K12 strain grown on solid media as a model system. The workflow thus provides a means to explore the proteomes of minimally passaged clinical isolates of bacteria grown on primary culture plates and to identify both unique and differentially expressed proteins contained therein. Value of the method: - Simple mass spectrometry-based proteomics workflow to characterise the proteome of single colony forming units - Enables exploration of the proteomes of minimally passaged clinical isolates from primary culture plates - Identification of virulence factors expressed in true or mimicked biofilms that may be missed in liquid cultures Method name: E. coli single colony proteome analysis.
PXD023719	34436504	PRM-MS Quantitative Analysis of Isomeric N-Glycopeptides Derived from Human Serum Haptoglobin of Patients with Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma. 	PRM-MS quantitative analysis of isomeric N-glycopeptides derived from human serum haptoglobin of patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Cancer (B/D-HPP), Cirrhosis, Glycoproteomics (B/D-HPP), Haptoglobin, Hepatocellular car, Human Proteome Project, N-Glycopeptides, PRM, ProteomeXchange project tag: Liver (B/D-HPP)	Currently, surveillance strategies have inadequate performance for cirrhosis and early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The glycosylation of serum haptoglobin has shown to have significant differences between cirrhosis and HCC, thus can be used for diagnosis. We performed a comprehensive liquid chromatography-parallel reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (LC-PRM-MS) approach, where a targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) strategy was coupled to a powerful LC system, to study the site-specific isomerism of haptoglobin (Hp) extracted from cirrhosis and HCC patients. We found that our strategy was able to identify a large number of isomeric N-glycopeptides, mainly located in the Hp glycosylation site Asn207. Four N-glycopeptides were found to have significant changes in abundance between cirrhosis and HCC samples (p < 0.05). Strategic combinations of the significant N-glycopeptides, either with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or themselves, better estimate the areas under the curve (AUC) of their respective receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with respect to AFP. The combination of AFP with the isomeric sialylated fucosylated N-glycopeptides Asn207 + 5-6-1-2 and Asn207 + 5-6-1-3, resulted with an AUC value of 0.98, while the AUC value for AFP alone was 0.85. When comparing cirrhosis vs. early HCC, the isomeric N-glycopeptide Asn207 + 5-6-0-1 better estimated AUC with respect to AFP (AUCAFP = 0.81, and AUCAsn207 + 5-6-0-1 = 0.88, respectively).
PXD023443	34436580	Complexome profiling on the Chlamydomonas lpa2 mutant reveals insights into PSII biogenesis and new PSII associated proteins. 	Complexome profiling on the lpa2 mutant	Chlamydomonas Complexomics lpa2	While the composition and function of the major thylakoid membrane complexes are well understood, comparatively little is known about their biogenesis. The goal of this work was to shed more light on the role of auxiliary factors in the biogenesis of photosystem II (PSII). Here we have identified the homolog of LOW PSII ACCUMULATION 2 (LPA2) in Chlamydomonas. A Chlamydomonas reinhardtii lpa2 mutant grew slower in low light, was hypersensitive to high light, and exhibited aberrant structures in thylakoid membrane stacks. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) was reduced by 38%. Synthesis and stability of newly made PSII core subunits D1, D2, CP43, and CP47 were not impaired. However, complexome profiling revealed that in the mutant CP43 was reduced to ~23% and D1, D2, and CP47 to ~30% of wild type levels. Levels of PSI and the cytochrome b6f complex were unchanged, while levels of the ATP synthase were increased by ~29%. PSII supercomplexes, dimers, and monomers were reduced to ~7%, ~26%, and ~60% of wild type levels, while RC47 was increased ~6-fold and LHCII by ~27%. We propose that LPA2 catalyses a step during PSII assembly without which PSII monomers and further assemblies become unstable and prone to degradation. The LHCI antenna was more disconnected from PSI in the lpa2 mutant, presumably as an adaptive response to reduce excitation of PSI. From the co-migration profiles of 1734 membrane-associated proteins, we identified three novel putative PSII associated proteins with potential roles in regulating PSII complex dynamics, assembly, and chlorophyll breakdown.
PXD026818	34436902	Automated Spatially Targeted Optical Microproteomics Investigates Inflammatory Lesions In Situ. 	CD68+ region of rat scar tissue by AutoSTOMP	autoSTOMP, macrophage, rat cardiac scar	Tissue microenvironment properties like blood flow, extracellular matrix, or proximity to immune-infiltrate are important regulators of cell biology. However, methods to study regional protein expression in the native tissue environment are limited. To address this need, we developed a novel approach to visualize, purify, and measure proteins in situ using automated spatially targeted optical microproteomics (AutoSTOMP). Here, we report custom codes to specify regions of heterogeneity in a tissue section and UV-biotinylate proteins within those regions. We have developed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS-compatible biochemistry to purify those proteins and label-free quantification methodology to determine protein enrichment in target cell types or structures relative to nontarget regions in the same sample. These tools were applied to (a) identify inflammatory proteins expressed by CD68(+) macrophages in rat cardiac infarcts and (b) characterize inflammatory proteins enriched in IgG4(+) lesions in human esophageal tissues. These data indicate that AutoSTOMP is a flexible approach to determine regional protein expression in situ on a range of primary tissues and clinical biopsies where current tools and sample availability are limited.
PXD025462	34437303	The autoimmune signature of hyperinflammatory multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. 	Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) serum proteomics	Covid-19, DIA, LC-MS, MIS-C, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, Serum	Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) manifests as a severe and uncontrolled inflammatory response with multiorgan involvement, occurring weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we utilized proteomics, RNA sequencing, autoantibody arrays, and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire analysis to characterize MIS-C immunopathogenesis and identify factors contributing to severe manifestations and intensive care unit admission. Inflammation markers, humoral immune responses, neutrophil activation, and complement and coagulation pathways were highly enriched in MIS-C patient serum, with a more hyperinflammatory profile in severe than in mild MIS-C cases. We identified a strong autoimmune signature in MIS-C, with autoantibodies targeted to both ubiquitously expressed and tissue-specific antigens, suggesting autoantigen release and excessive antigenic drive may result from systemic tissue damage. We further identified a cluster of patients with enhanced neutrophil responses as well as high anti-Spike IgG and autoantibody titers. BCR sequencing of these patients identified a strong imprint of antigenic drive with substantial BCR sequence connectivity and usage of autoimmunity-associated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) genes. This cluster was linked to a TRBV11-2 expanded T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, consistent with previous studies indicating a superantigen-driven pathogenic process. Overall, we identify a combination of pathogenic pathways that culminate in MIS-C and may inform treatment.
PXD026416	34437385	Snake Venom Proteomics, Immunoreactivity and Toxicity Neutralization Studies for the Asiatic Mountain Pit Vipers, Ovophis convictus, Ovophis tonkinensis, and Hime Habu, Ovophis okinavensis. 	Proteome data of snake venoms_file 9	LCMS/MS, Snake venom, Venom proteome	Snakebite envenomation is a serious neglected tropical disease, and its management is often complicated by the diversity of snake venoms. In Asia, pit vipers of the Ovophis species complex are medically important venomous snakes whose venom properties have not been investigated in depth. This study characterized the venom proteomes of Ovophis convictus (West Malaysia), Ovophis tonkinensis (northern Vietnam, southern China), and Ovophis okinavensis (Okinawa, Japan) by applying liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, which detected a high abundance of snake venom serine proteases (SVSP, constituting 40-60% of total venom proteins), followed by phospholipases A2, snake venom metalloproteinases of mainly P-III class, L-amino acid oxidases, and toxins from other protein families which were less abundant. The venoms exhibited different procoagulant activities in human plasma, with potency decreasing from O. tonkinensis > O. okinavensis > O. convictus. The procoagulant nature of venom confirms that consumptive coagulopathy underlies the pathophysiology of Ovophis pit viper envenomation. The hetero-specific antivenoms Gloydius brevicaudus monovalent antivenom (GbMAV) and Trimeresurus albolabris monovalent antivenom (TaMAV) were immunoreactive toward the venoms, and cross-neutralized their procoagulant activities, albeit at variably limited efficacy. In the absence of species-specific antivenom, these hetero-specific antivenoms may be useful in treating coagulotoxic envenomation caused by the different snakes in their respective regions.
PXD027185	34437454	Metaproteomics Reveals Alteration of the Gut Microbiome in Weaned Piglets Due to the Ingestion of the Mycotoxins Deoxynivalenol and Zearalenone. 	Pig metaproteome and mycotoxins	microbiome, mycotoxins, pig	The ingestion of mycotoxins can cause adverse health effects and represents a severe health risk to humans and livestock. Even though several acute and chronic effects have been described, the effect on the gut metaproteome is scarcely known. For that reason, we used metaproteomics to evaluate the effect of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) on the gut microbiome of 15 weaned piglets. Animals were fed for 28 days with feed contaminated with different concentrations of DON (DONlow: 870 mug DON/kg feed, DONhigh: 2493 mug DON/kg feed) or ZEN (ZENlow: 679 mug ZEN/kg feed, ZENhigh: 1623 mug ZEN/kg feed). Animals in the control group received uncontaminated feed. The gut metaproteome composition in the high toxin groups shifted compared to the control and low mycotoxin groups, and it was also more similar among high toxin groups. These changes were accompanied by the increase in peptides belonging to Actinobacteria and a decrease in peptides belonging to Firmicutes. Additionally, DONhigh and ZENhigh increased the abundance of proteins associated with the ribosomes and pentose-phosphate pathways, while decreasing glycolysis and other carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Moreover, DONhigh and ZENhigh increased the abundance of the antioxidant enzyme thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxin. In summary, the ingestion of DON and ZEN altered the abundance of different proteins associated with microbial metabolism, genetic processing, and oxidative stress response, triggering a disruption in the gut microbiome structure.
PXD024444	34438494	Multiomics assessment in Enchytraeus crypticus exposed to Ag nanomaterials (Ag NM300K) and ions (AgNO3) - Metabolomics, proteomics (& transcriptomics). 	Multiomics assessment in  Enchytraeus crypticus  exposed to Ag (nano)materials (Ag NM300K and AgNO 3 )	Ag, E. crypticus, ecotoxicology, nanomaterial	Silver nanomaterials (AgNMs) are broadly used and among the most studied nanomaterials. The underlying molecular mechanisms (e.g. protein and metabolite response) that precede phenotypical effects have been assessed to a much lesser extent. In this paper, we assess differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and metabolites (DEMs) by high-throughput (HTP) techniques (HPLC-MS/MS with tandem mass tags, reversed-phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) with mass spectrometric detection). In a time series (0, 7, 14 days), the standard soil model Enchytraeus crypticus was exposed to AgNM300K and AgNO3 at the reproduction EC20 and EC50. The impact on proteins/metabolites was clearly larger after 14 days. NM300K caused more upregulated DEPs/DEMs, more so at the EC20, whereas AgNO3 caused a dose response increase of DEPs/DEMs. Similar pathways were activated, although often via opposite regulation (up vs down) of DEPs, hence, dissimilar mechanisms underlie the apical observed impact. Affected pathways included e.g. energy and lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. Uniquely affected by AgNO3 was catalase, malate dehydrogenase and ATP-citrate synthase, and heat shock proteins (HSP70) and ferritin were affected by AgNM300K. The gene expression-based data in Adverse Outcome Pathway was confirmed and additional key events added, e.g. regulation of catalase and heat shock proteins were confirmed to be included. Finally, we observed (as we have seen before) that lower concentration of the NM caused higher biological impact. Data was deposited to ProteomeXchange, identifier PXD024444.
PXD025920	34438637	Hepatic Proteomic Analysis Reveals That Enhanced Carboxylic Acid Metabolism and Oxidoreduction Promote Muscle and Fat Deposition in Muscovy Duck. 	Proteomic Analysis Muscle and Fat Deposition in Muscovy duck	2DE, LC/MSMS, Muscovy duck, liver	Liver is responsible for 90% of lipid synthesis in poultry; thus, it plays an important role in the growth of Muscovy ducks, which have a high fat deposition ability in a time-dependent manner. Therefore, male Muscovy ducks at 14, 28, 42, and 56 days were selected for body weight (BW), carcass weight (CW), subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT), abdominal fat weight (AFW), intramuscular fat content (IMF), and breast muscle fiber (BMF) diameter and density determination. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) combining liquid chromatography linked to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze proteomic changes in liver at each stage. The BW, CW, AFW, SFT, and BMF diameter and density were significantly increased, while IMF content was significantly decreased at 28 to 42 days of age (p < 0.05). There were 57 differentially abundant protein (DEP) spots representing 40 proteins identified among the ages, in which 17, 41 and 4 spots were differentially abundant at 14 vs. 28, 28 vs. 42, and 42 vs. 56, respectively. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis found that DEPs were mostly enriched in the oxidation-reduction process, carboxylic acid metabolism, etc. Protein-protein interaction showed that catalase (CAT), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), and protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI) were the key proteins responsible for the growth of Muscovy duck. In conclusion, 28 to 42 days of age is the crucial period for Muscovy ducks, and the ability of metabolism and antioxidants were significantly enhanced in liver.
PXD022131	34439123	Network-Based Integration of Multi-Omics Data Identifies the Determinants of miR-491-5p Effects. 	Network-based integration of multi-omics data identifies the determinants of miR-491-5p effects	Multi-omics, Network, Ovarian Cancer, miRNA	The identification of miRNAs' targets and associated regulatory networks might allow the definition of new strategies using drugs whose association mimics a given miRNA's effects. Based on this assumption we devised a multi-omics approach to precisely characterize miRNAs' effects. We combined miR-491-5p target affinity purification, RNA microarray, and mass spectrometry to perform an integrated analysis in ovarian cancer cell lines. We thus constructed an interaction network that highlighted highly connected hubs being either direct or indirect targets of miR-491-5p effects: the already known EGFR and BCL2L1 but also EP300, CTNNB1 and several small-GTPases. By using different combinations of specific inhibitors of these hubs, we could greatly enhance their respective cytotoxicity and mimic the miR-491-5p-induced phenotype. Our methodology thus constitutes an interesting strategy to comprehensively study the effects of a given miRNA. Moreover, we identified targets for which pharmacological inhibitors are already available for a clinical use or in clinical trials. This study might thus enable innovative therapeutic options for ovarian cancer, which remains the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies in developed countries.
PXD026447	34439305	PD-L1 Overexpression, SWI/SNF Complex Deregulation, and Profound Transcriptomic Changes Characterize Cancer-Dependent Exhaustion of Persistently Activated CD4(+) T Cells. 	PD-L1 overexpression, SWI/SNF complex Deregulation and Profound Transcriptomic Changes Characterize Cancer-Dependent Exhaustion of Persistently Activated CD4+ T Cells	CD4+ effector T cells, PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L1/PD-1 axis, SWI/SNF complex, T cell exhaustion	Growing tumors avoid recognition and destruction by the immune system. During continuous stimulation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by tumors, TILs become functionally exhausted; thus, they become unable to kill tumor cells and to produce certain cytokines and lose their ability to proliferate. This collectively results in the immune escape of cancer cells. Here, we show that breast cancer cells expressing PD-L1 can accelerate exhaustion of persistently activated human effector CD4(+) T cells, manifesting in high PD-1 and PD-L1 expression level son T cell surfaces, decreased glucose metabolism genes, strong downregulation of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunits, and p21 cell cycle inhibitor upregulation. This results in inhibition of T cell proliferation and reduction of T cell numbers. The RNAseq analysis on exhausted CD4(+) T cells indicated strong overexpression of IDO1 and genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Some interleukins were also detected in media from CD4(+) T cells co-cultured with cancer cells. The PD-L1 overexpression was also observed in CD4(+) T cells after co-cultivation with other cell lines overexpressing PD-L1, which suggested the existence of a general mechanism of CD4(+) T cell exhaustion induced by cancer cells. The ChIP analysis on the PD-L1 promoter region indicated that the BRM recruitment in control CD4(+) T cells was replaced by BRG1 and EZH2 in CD4(+) T cells strongly exhausted by cancer cells. These findings suggest that epi-drugs such as EZH2 inhibitors may be used as immunomodulators in cancer treatment.
PXD024434	34439311	The Fatty Acid and Protein Profiles of Circulating CD81-Positive Small Extracellular Vesicles Are Associated with Disease Stage in Melanoma Patients. 	Proteomic signature of plasma-derived exosomes in different stages of melanoma patients.	exosomes, melanoma	The early detection of cutaneous melanoma, a potentially lethal cancer with rising incidence, is fundamental to increasing survival and therapeutic adjustment. In stages II-IV especially, additional indications for adjuvant therapy purposes after resection and for treatment of metastatic patients are urgently needed. We investigated whether the fatty acid (FA) and protein compositions of small extracellular vesicles (sEV) derived from the plasma of stage 0-I, II and III-IV melanoma patients (n = 38) could reflect disease stage. The subpopulation of sEV expressing CD81 EV marker (CD81sEV) was captured by an ad hoc immune affinity technique from plasma depleted of large EV. Biological macromolecules were investigated by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry in CD81sEV. A higher content of FA was detectable in patients with respect to healthy donors (HD). Moreover, a higher C18:0/C18:1 ratio, as a marker of cell membrane fluidity, distinguished early (stage 0-I) from late (III-IV) stages' CD81sEV. Proteomics detected increases in CD14, PON1, PON3 and APOA5 exclusively in stage II CD81sEV, and RAP1B was decreased in stage III-IV CD81sEV, in comparison to HD. Our results suggest that stage dependent alterations in CD81sEV' FA and protein composition may occur early after disease onset, strengthening the potential of circulating sEV as a source of discriminatory information for early diagnosis, prediction of metastatic behavior and following up of melanoma patients.
PXD022794	34439883	Isotopically Dimethyl Labeling-Based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Phosphoproteomes of Soybean Cultivars. 	Dimethyl labeling-based quantitative PTM proteomic analysis of drought-regulated phosphoproteomes in soybean drought-tolerant cultivar	Glycine max, Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, dimethyl labelling, overly post-translationally modified protein (OPP), phosphoproteomics, quantitative PTM proteomics, soybean drought-tolerant cultivar	Isotopically dimethyl labeling was applied in a quantitative post-translational modification (PTM) proteomic study of phosphoproteomic changes in the drought responses of two contrasting soybean cultivars. A total of 9457 phosphopeptides were identified subsequently, corresponding to 4571 phosphoprotein groups and 3889 leading phosphoproteins, which contained nine kinase families consisting of 279 kinases. These phosphoproteins contained a total of 8087 phosphosites, 6106 of which were newly identified and constituted 54% of the current soybean phosphosite repository. These phosphosites were converted into the highly conserved kinase docking sites by bioinformatics analysis, which predicted six kinase families that matched with those newly found nine kinase families. The overly post-translationally modified proteins (OPP) occupies 2.1% of these leading phosphoproteins. Most of these OPPs are photoreceptors, mRNA-, histone-, and phospholipid-binding proteins, as well as protein kinase/phosphatases. The subgroup population distribution of phosphoproteins over the number of phosphosites of phosphoproteins follows the exponential decay law, Y = 4.13e(-0.098X) - 0.04. Out of 218 significantly regulated unique phosphopeptide groups, 188 phosphoproteins were regulated by the drought-tolerant cultivar under the water loss condition. These significantly regulated phosphoproteins (SRP) are mainly enriched in the biological functions of water transport and deprivation, methionine metabolic processes, photosynthesis/light reaction, and response to cadmium ion, osmotic stress, and ABA response. Seventeen and 15 SRPs are protein kinases/phosphatases and transcription factors, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis again revealed that three members of the calcium dependent protein kinase family (CAMK family), GmSRK2I, GmCIPK25, and GmAKINbeta1 kinases, constitute a phosphor-relay-mediated signal transduction network, regulating ion channel activities and many nuclear events in this drought-tolerant cultivar, which presumably contributes to the development of the soybean drought tolerance under water deprivation process.
PXD022354	34439896	Epithelial Cell Line Derived from Endometriotic Lesion Mimics Macrophage Nervous Mechanism of Pain Generation on Proteome and Metabolome Levels. 	Epithelial cell line derived from endometriotic lesions mimics macrophage nervous mechanism of pain generation on proteome and metabolome levels	Endometriosis, inflammation, metabolomics, multi-omics	Endometriosis is a benign disease affecting one in ten women of reproductive age worldwide. Although the pain level is not correlated to the extent of the disease, it is still one of the cardinal symptoms strongly affecting the patients' quality of life. Yet, a molecular mechanism of this pathology, including the formation of pain, remains to be defined. Recent studies have indicated a close interaction between newly generated nerve cells and macrophages, leading to neurogenic inflammation in the pelvic area. In this context, the responsiveness of an endometriotic cell culture model was characterized upon inflammatory stimulation by employing a multi-omics approach, including proteomics, metabolomics and eicosanoid analysis. Differential proteomic profiling of the 12-Z endometriotic cell line treated with TNFalpha and IL1beta unexpectedly showed that the inflammatory stimulation was able to induce a protein signature associated with neuroangiogenesis, specifically including neuropilins (NRP1/2). Untargeted metabolomic profiling in the same setup further revealed that the endometriotic cells were capable of the autonomous production of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), 7,8-dihydroneopterin, normetanephrine and epinephrine. These metabolites are related to the development of neuropathic pain and the former three were found up-regulated upon inflammatory stimulation. Additionally, 12-Z cells were found to secrete the mono-oxygenated oxylipin 16-HETE, a known inhibitor of neutrophil aggregation and adhesion. Thus, inflammatory stimulation of endometriotic 12-Z cells led to specific protein and metabolite expression changes suggesting a direct involvement of these epithelial-like cells in endometriosis pain development.
PXD026726	34440794	Proteomic-Based Analysis of Hypoxia- and Physioxia-Responsive Proteins and Pathways in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. 	Proteomic-based analysis of hypoxia and physioxia responsive proteins and pathways in DLBCLProteomic-based analysis of hypoxia and physioxia responsive proteins and pathways in DLBCL	B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, cell stress, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), hypoxia, label-free quantitative proteomics, physioxia, protein-protein interaction network (PPIN)	Hypoxia is a common feature in most tumors, including hematological malignancies. There is a lack of studies on hypoxia- and physioxia-induced global proteome changes in lymphoma. Here, we sought to explore how the proteome of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) changes when cells are exposed to acute hypoxic stress (1% of O2) and physioxia (5% of O2) for a long-time. A total of 8239 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS, of which 718, 513, and 486 had significant changes, in abundance, in the Ri-1, U2904, and U2932 cell lines, respectively. We observed that changes in B-NHL proteome profiles induced by hypoxia and physioxia were quantitatively similar in each cell line; however, differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were specific to a certain cell line. A significant downregulation of several ribosome proteins indicated a translational inhibition of new ribosome protein synthesis in hypoxia, what was confirmed in a pathway enrichment analysis. In addition, downregulated proteins highlighted the altered cell cycle, metabolism, and interferon signaling. As expected, the enrichment of upregulated proteins revealed terms related to metabolism, HIF1 signaling, and response to oxidative stress. In accordance to our results, physioxia induced weaker changes in the protein abundance when compared to those induced by hypoxia. Our data provide new evidence for understanding mechanisms by which DLBCL cells respond to a variable oxygen level. Furthermore, this study reveals multiple hypoxia-responsive proteins showing an altered abundance in hypoxic and physioxic DLBCL. It remains to be investigated whether changes in the proteomes of DLBCL under normoxia and physioxia have functional consequences on lymphoma development and progression.
PXD027765	34443691	Donkey Milk Fermentation by Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and Lactobacillus rhamnosus Affects the Antiviral and Antibacterial Milk Properties. 	Donkey milk fermentation by Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and Lactobacillus rhamnosus affects the antiviral and antibacterial milk properties	Lactobacillus rhamnosus 17D10, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 40FEL3, bioactive peptides, donkey milk	BACKGROUND: Milk is considered an important source of bioactive peptides, which can be produced by endogenous or starter bacteria, such as lactic acid bacteria, that are considered effective and safe producers of food-grade bioactive peptides. Among the various types of milk, donkey milk has been gaining more and more attention for its nutraceutical properties. METHODS: Lactobacillus rhamnosus 17D10 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 40FEL3 were selected for their ability to produce peptides from donkey milk. The endogenous peptides and those obtained after bacterial fermentation were assayed for their antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral activities. The peptide mixtures were characterized by means of LC-MS/MS and then analyzed in silico using the Milk Bioactive Peptide DataBase. RESULTS: The peptides produced by the two selected bacteria enhanced the antioxidant activity and reduced E. coli growth. Only the peptides produced by L. rhamnosus 17D10 were able to reduce S. aureus growth. All the peptide mixtures were able to inhibit the replication of HSV-1 by more than 50%. Seventeen peptides were found to have 60% sequence similarity with already known bioactive peptides. CONCLUSIONS: A lactic acid bacterium fermentation process is able to enhance the value of donkey milk through bioactivities that are important for human health.

Hepatic proteomic analysis of selenoprotein T knockout mice by TMT: Implications for the role of selenoprotein T in glucose and lipid metabolism	Glucose and lipid metabolism, Knockout, Selenoprotein T, TMT	Selenoprotein T (SELENOT, SelT), a thioredoxin-like enzyme, exerts an essential oxidoreductase activity in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, its precise function remains unknown. To gain more understanding of SELENOT function, a conventional global Selenot knockout (KO) mouse model was constructed for the first time using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. Deletion of SELENOT caused male sterility, reduced size/body weight, lower fed and/or fasting blood glucose levels and lower fasting serum insulin levels, and improved blood lipid profile. Tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics analysis was conducted to explore the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the liver of male mice, revealing 60 up-regulated and 94 down-regulated DEPs in KO mice. The proteomic results were validated by western blot of three selected DEPs. The elevated expression of Glycogen [starch] synthase, liver (Gys2) is consistent with the hypoglycemic phenotype in KO mice. Furthermore, the bioinformatics analysis showed that Selenot-KO-induced DEPs were mainly related to lipid metabolism, cancer, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades, and protein digestion and absorption. Overall, these findings provide a holistic perspective into SELENOT function and novel insights into the role of SELENOT in glucose and lipid metabolism, and thus, enhance our understanding of SELENOT function.
PXD027496	34445236	Global Lysine Acetylome Analysis of LPS-Stimulated HepG2 Cells Identified Hyperacetylation of PKM2 as a Metabolic Regulator in Sepsis. 	Global Lysine Acetylome Analysis of LPS-Stimulated HepG2 Cells Identifies Hyperacetylation of PKM2 as a Metabolic Reg-ulator in Sepsis	Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), SIRT, hyperacetylation, lysine acetylation, pyruvate kinase M2, sepsis-induced liver dysfunction	Sepsis-induced liver dysfunction (SILD) is a common event and is strongly associated with mortality. Establishing a causative link between protein post-translational modification and diseases is challenging. We studied the relationship among lysine acetylation (Kac), sirtuin (SIRTs), and the factors involved in SILD, which was induced in LPS-stimulated HepG2 cells. Protein hyperacetylation was observed according to SIRTs reduction after LPS treatment for 24 h. We identified 1449 Kac sites based on comparative acetylome analysis and quantified 1086 Kac sites on 410 proteins for acetylation. Interestingly, the upregulated Kac proteins are enriched in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) category. Among the proteins in the glycolysis pathway, hyperacetylation, a key regulator of lactate level in sepsis, was observed at three pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) sites. Hyperacetylation of PKM2 induced an increase in its activity, consequently increasing the lactate concentration. In conclusion, this study is the first to conduct global profiling of Kac, suggesting that the Kac mechanism of PKM2 in glycolysis is associated with sepsis. Moreover, it helps to further understand the systematic information regarding hyperacetylation during the sepsis process.
PXD027050	34445411	Inhibition of BET Proteins during Adolescence Affects Prefrontal Cortical Development: Relevance to Schizophrenia. 	Inhibition of BET proteins during adolescence affects prefrontal cortex development: relevance to schizophrenia	BET proteins, MALDI-TOF/TOF, prefrontal cortex, schizophrenia, shotgun	BACKGROUND: The present study investigated the role of proteins from the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family in schizophrenia-like abnormalities in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia induced by prenatal methylazoxymethanol (MAM) administration (MAM-E17). METHODS: An inhibitor of BET proteins, JQ1, was administered during adolescence on postnatal days (P) 23-P29, and behavioural responses (sensorimotor gating, recognition memory) and prefrontal cortical (mPFC) function (long-term potentiation (LTP), molecular and proteomic analyses) studies were performed in adult males and females. RESULTS: Deficits in sensorimotor gating and recognition memory were observed only in MAM-treated males. However, adolescent JQ1 treatment affected animals of both sexes in the control but not MAM-treated groups and reduced behavioural responses in both sexes. An electrophysiological study showed LTP impairments only in male MAM-treated animals, and JQ1 did not affect LTP in the mPFC. In contrast, MAM did not affect activity-dependent gene expression, but JQ1 altered gene expression in both sexes. A proteomic study revealed alterations in MAM-treated groups mainly in males, while JQ1 affected both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: MAM-induced schizophrenia-like abnormalities were observed only in males, while adolescent JQ1 treatment affected memory recognition and altered the molecular and proteomic landscape in the mPFC of both sexes. Thus, transient adolescent inhibition of the BET family might prompt permanent alterations in the mPFC.

Proteomics of Mouse Heart Ventricles Reveals Mitochondria and Metabolism as Major Targets of a Post-Infarction  Short-Acting GLP1Ra-Therapy Proteomics of Mouse Heart Ventricles Reveals Mitochondria and Metabolism as Major Targets of a Post-Infarction  Sho	DMB, cellular respiration, early cardiac remodeling, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, metabolism, mitochondrion	Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death worldwide, making it crucial to search for new therapies to mitigate major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) after a cardiac ischemic episode. Drugs in the class of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1Ra) have demonstrated benefits for heart function and reduced the incidence of MACE in patients with diabetes. Previously, we demonstrated that a short-acting GLP1Ra known as DMB (2-quinoxalinamine, 6,7-dichloro-N-[1,1-dimethylethyl]-3-[methylsulfonyl]-,6,7-dichloro-2-methylsulfonyl-3-N-tert-butylaminoquinoxaline or compound 2, Sigma) also mitigates adverse postinfarction left ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in lean mice through activation of parkin-mediated mitophagy following infarction. Here, we combined proteomics with in silico analysis to characterize the range of effects of DMB in vivo throughout the course of early postinfarction remodeling. We demonstrate that the mitochondrion is a key target of DMB and mitochondrial respiration, oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic processes such as glycolysis and fatty acid beta-oxidation are the main biological processes being regulated by this compound in the heart. Moreover, the overexpression of proteins with hub properties identified by protein-protein interaction networks, such as Atp2a2, may also be important to the mechanism of action of DMB. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027867.
PXD027204	34445714	The Arabidopsis HY2 Gene Acts as a Positive Regulator of NaCl Signaling during Seed Germination. 	Arabidopsis hy2 mutant LC-MS/MS	NaCl  seed germination	Phytochromobilin (PPhiB) participates in the regulation of plant growth and development as an important synthetase of photoreceptor phytochromes (phy). In addition, Arabidopsis long hypocotyl 2 (HY2) appropriately works as a key PPhiB synthetase. However, whether HY2 takes part in the plant stress response signal network remains unknown. Here, we described the function of HY2 in NaCl signaling. The hy2 mutant was NaCl-insensitive, whereas HY2-overexpressing lines showed NaCl-hypersensitive phenotypes during seed germination. The exogenous NaCl induced the transcription and the protein level of HY2, which positively mediated the expression of downstream stress-related genes of RD29A, RD29B, and DREB2A. Further quantitative proteomics showed the patterns of 7391 proteins under salt stress. HY2 was then found to specifically mediate 215 differentially regulated proteins (DRPs), which, according to GO enrichment analysis, were mainly involved in ion homeostasis, flavonoid biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, hormone response (SA, JA, ABA, ethylene), the reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic pathway, photosynthesis, and detoxification pathways to respond to salt stress. More importantly, ANNAT1-ANNAT2-ANNAT3-ANNAT4 and GSTU19-GSTF10-RPL5A-RPL5B-AT2G32060, two protein interaction networks specifically regulated by HY2, jointly participated in the salt stress response. These results direct the pathway of HY2 participating in salt stress, and provide new insights for the plant to resist salt stress.
PXD028122	34445801	TRIM25 and DEAD-Box RNA Helicase DDX3X Cooperate to Regulate RIG-I-Mediated Antiviral Immunity. 	Ubiquitination of DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3X by TRIM25	DDX3X, TRIM25, Ubiquitin	The cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) initiate interferon (IFN) production and antiviral gene expression in response to RNA virus infection. Consequently, RLR signalling is tightly regulated by both host and viral factors. Tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates multiple substrates within the RLR signalling cascade, playing both ubiquitination-dependent and -independent roles in RIG-I-mediated IFN induction. However, additional regulatory roles are emerging. Here, we show a novel interaction between TRIM25 and another protein in the RLR pathway that is essential for type I IFN induction, DEAD-box helicase 3X (DDX3X). In vitro assays and knockdown studies reveal that TRIM25 ubiquitinates DDX3X at lysine 55 (K55) and that TRIM25 and DDX3X cooperatively enhance IFNB1 induction following RIG-I activation, but the latter is independent of TRIM25's catalytic activity. Furthermore, we found that the influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) disrupts the TRIM25:DDX3X interaction, abrogating both TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of DDX3X and cooperative activation of the IFNB1 promoter. Thus, our results reveal a new interplay between two RLR-host proteins that cooperatively enhance IFN-beta production. We also uncover a new and further mechanism by which influenza A virus NS1 suppresses host antiviral defence.
PXD009383	34446021	DDX56 modulates post-transcriptional Wnt signaling through miRNAs and is associated with early recurrence in squamous cell lung carcinoma. 	Human,squamous cell lung cancer,LC-MS/MS	squamous cell lung cancer	BACKGROUND: Early recurrence is a major obstacle to prolonged postoperative survival in squamous cell lung carcinoma (SqCLC). The molecular mechanisms underlying early SqCLC recurrence remain unclear, and effective prognostic biomarkers for predicting early recurrence are needed. METHODS: We analyzed primary tumor samples of 20 SqCLC patients using quantitative proteomics to identify differentially-expressed proteins in patients who experienced early versus late disease recurrence. The expression and prognostic significance of DDX56 was evaluated using a SqCLC tumor tissue microarray and further verified using different online databases. We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to obtain detailed molecular insight into the functional role of DDX56 in SqCLC. RESULTS: We found that DDX56 exhibited increased expression in tumors of patients who experienced early versus late disease recurrence. Increased DDX56 expression in SqCLC tumors was subsequently confirmed as an independent prognostic factor of poor recurrence-free survival in independent SqCLC cohorts. Functionally, DDX56 promotes SqCLC cell growth and migration in vitro, and xenograft tumor progression in vivo. Mechanistically, DDX56 post-transcriptionally promotes expression of multiple Wnt signaling pathway-related genes, including CTNNB1, WNT2B, and represses a subset of miRNAs, including miR-378a-3p, a known suppressor of Wnt signaling. Detailed analysis revealed that DDX56 facilitated degradation of primary miR-378a, leading to down-regulation of mature miR-378a-3p and thus derepression of the target gene WNT2B. CONCLUSION: We identified DDX56 as a novel independent prognostic biomarker that exerts its oncogenic effects through miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of Wnt signaling genes to promote early SqCLC recurrence. DDX56 may assist in identifying SqCLC patients at increased risk of early recurrence and who could benefit from Wnt signaling-targeted therapies.
PXD023063	34446097	Accessory enzymes of hypercellulolytic Penicillium funiculosum facilitate complete saccharification of sugarcane bagasse. 	Comparative proteomic analysis of secretomes from engineered Penicillium funiculosum modulated with sugarcane bagasse	Biomass saccharification, CAZymes, Engineered PfMig188, Sugarcane bagasse, quantitative mass spectrometry	BACKGROUND: Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) is an abundant feedstock for second-generation bioethanol production. This complex biomass requires an array of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), mostly from filamentous fungi, for its deconstruction to monomeric sugars for the production of value-added fuels and chemicals. In this study, we evaluated the repertoire of proteins in the secretome of a catabolite repressor-deficient strain of Penicillium funiculosum, PfMig1(88), in response to SCB induction and examined their role in the saccharification of SCB. RESULTS: A systematic approach was developed for the cultivation of the fungus with the aim of producing and understanding arrays of enzymes tailored for saccharification of SCB. To achieve this, the fungus was grown in media supplemented with different concentrations of pretreated SCB (0-45 g/L). The profile of secreted proteins was characterized by enzyme activity assays and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 280 proteins were identified in the secretome of PfMig1(88), 46% of them being clearly identified as CAZymes. Modulation of the cultivation media with SCB up to 15 g/L led to sequential enhancement in the secretion of hemicellulases and cell wall-modifying enzymes, including endo-beta-1,3(4)-glucanase (GH16), endo-alpha-1,3-glucanase (GH71), xylanase (GH30), beta-xylosidase (GH5), beta-1,3-galactosidase (GH43) and cutinase (CE5). There was ~ 122% and 60% increases in beta-xylosidase and cutinase activities, respectively. There was also a 36% increase in activities towards mixed-linked glucans. Induction of these enzymes in the secretome improved the saccharification performance to 98% (~ 20% increase over control), suggesting their synergy with core cellulases in accessing the recalcitrant region of SCB. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide an insight into the enzyme system of PfMig1(88) for degradation of complex biomass such as SCB and highlight the importance of adding SCB to the culture medium to optimize the secretion of enzymes specific for the saccharification of sugarcane bagasse.
PXD026556	34446700	OCT4 cooperates with distinct ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers in naive and primed pluripotent states in human. 	OCT4 IP-MS in Naive and Primed Human ESCs	ESC, OCT4	Understanding the molecular underpinnings of pluripotency is a prerequisite for optimal maintenance and application of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). While the protein-protein interactions of core pluripotency factors have been identified in mouse ESCs, their interactome in human ESCs (hESCs) has not to date been explored. Here we mapped the OCT4 interactomes in naive and primed hESCs, revealing extensive connections to mammalian ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes. In naive hESCs, OCT4 is associated with both BRG1 and BRM, the two paralog ATPases of the BAF complex. Genome-wide location analyses and genetic studies reveal that these two enzymes cooperate in a functionally redundant manner in the transcriptional regulation of blastocyst-specific genes. In contrast, in primed hESCs, OCT4 cooperates with BRG1 and SOX2 to promote chromatin accessibility at ectodermal genes. This work reveals how a common transcription factor utilizes differential BAF complexes to control distinct transcriptional programs in naive and primed hESCs.
PXD040709	34446716	PTENalpha functions as an immune suppressor and promotes immune resistance in PTEN-mutant cancer. 	Identification of PTENalpha associated proteins under stress condictions in B16 cells by mass spectrometry	H2O2, PTENalpha, protein-protein interaction	PTEN is frequently mutated in human cancers and PTEN mutants promote tumor progression and metastasis. PTEN mutations have been implicated in immune regulation, however, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Here, we report that PTENalpha, the isoform of PTEN, remains active in cancer bearing stop-gained PTEN mutations. Through counteraction of CD8(+) T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, PTENalpha leads to T cell dysfunction and accelerates immune-resistant cancer progression. Clinical analysis further uncovers that PTENalpha-active mutations suppress host immune responses and result in poor prognosis in cancer as relative to PTENalpha-inactive mutations. Furthermore, germline deletion of Ptenalpha in mice increases cell susceptibility to immune attack through augmenting stress granule formation and limiting synthesis of peroxidases, leading to massive oxidative cell death and severe inflammatory damage. We propose that PTENalpha protects tumor from T cell killing and thus PTENalpha is a potential target in antitumor immunotherapy.
PXD013138	34446760	Effect of pH on the denitrification proteome of the soil bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222. 	Effect of pH on the proteome of Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222 under denitrifying conditions	Paracoccus denitrificans, denitrification, pH	Denitrification is a respiratory process by which nitrate is reduced to dinitrogen. Incomplete denitrification results in the emission of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide and this is potentiated in acidic soils, which display reduced denitrification rates and high N2O/N2 ratios compared to alkaline soils. In this work, impact of pH on the proteome of the soil denitrifying bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans PD1222 was analysed with nitrate as sole energy and nitrogen source under anaerobic conditions at pH ranging from 6.5 to 7.5. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that the highest difference in protein representation was observed when the proteome at pH 6.5 was compared to the reference proteome at pH 7.2. However, this difference in the extracellular pH was not enough to produce modification of intracellular pH, which was maintained at 6.5 +/- 0.1. The biosynthetic pathways of several cofactors relevant for denitrification and nitrogen assimilation like cobalamin, riboflavin, molybdopterin and nicotinamide were negatively affected at pH 6.5. In addition, peptide representation of reductases involved in nitrate assimilation and denitrification were reduced at pH 6.5. Data highlight the strong negative impact of pH on NosZ synthesis and intracellular copper content, thus impairing active NosZ assembly and, in turn, leading to elevated nitrous oxide emissions.
PXD014968	34447357	Label-Free Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of the Global Response to Indole-3-Acetic Acid in Newly Isolated Pseudomonas sp. Strain LY1. 	Indole-3-acetic acid degradation in a novel strain Pseudomonas composti LY1	Pseudomonas composti LY1, indole-3-acetic acid, microbial degradation	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), known as a common plant hormone, is one of the most distributed indole derivatives in the environment, but the degradation mechanism and cellular response network to IAA degradation are still not very clear. The objective of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of IAA degradation at the protein level by a newly isolated strain Pseudomonas sp. LY1. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of strain LY1 cultivated with IAA or citrate/NH4Cl was applied. A total of 2,604 proteins were identified, and 227 proteins have differential abundances in the presence of IAA, including 97 highly abundant proteins and 130 less abundant proteins. Based on the proteomic analysis an IAA degrading (iad) gene cluster in strain LY1 containing IAA transformation genes (organized as iadHABICDEFG), genes of the beta-ketoadipate pathway for catechol and protocatechuate degradation (catBCA and pcaABCDEF) were identified. The iadA, iadB, and iadE-disrupted mutants lost the ability to grow on IAA, which confirmed the role of the iad cluster in IAA degradation. Degradation intermediates were analyzed by HPLC, LC-MS, and GC-MS analysis. Proteomic analysis and identified products suggested that multiple degradation pathways existed in strain LY1. IAA was initially transformed to dioxindole-3-acetic acid, which was further transformed to isatin. Isatin was then transformed to isatinic acid or catechol. An in-depth data analysis suggested oxidative stress in strain LY1 during IAA degradation, and the abundance of a series of proteins was upregulated to respond to the stress, including reaction oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, protein repair, fatty acid synthesis, RNA protection, signal transduction, chemotaxis, and several membrane transporters. The findings firstly explained the adaptation mechanism of bacteria to IAA degradation.
PXD026501	34447787	Urinary Proteomics Identifying Novel Biomarkers for the Diagnosis and Phenotyping of Carotid Artery Stenosis. 	Urinary proteomics identifying novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and phenotyping of carotid artery stenosis	Biomarkers, Carotid artery stenosis, Stroke, Urine	Background: Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is caused by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques inside the arterial wall and accounts for 20-30% of all strokes. The development of an early, noninvasive diagnostic method and the identification of high-risk patients for ischemic stroke is essential to the management of CAS in clinical practice. Methods: We used the data-independent acquisition (DIA) technique to conduct a urinary proteomic study in patients with CAS and healthy controls. We identified the potential diagnosis and risk stratification biomarkers of CAS. And Ingenuity pathway analysis was used for functional annotation of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic values of DEPs. Results: A total of 194 DEPs were identified between CAS patients and healthy controls by DIA quantification. The bioinformatics analysis showed that these DEPs were correlated with the pathogenesis of CAS. We further identified 32 DEPs in symptomatic CAS compared to asymptomatic CAS, and biological function analysis revealed that these proteins are mainly related to immune/inflammatory pathways. Finally, a biomarker panel of six proteins (ACP2, PLD3, HLA-C, GGH, CALML3, and IL2RB) exhibited potential diagnostic value in CAS and good discriminative power for differentiating symptomatic and asymptomatic CAS with high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Our study identified novel potential urinary biomarkers for noninvasive early screening and risk stratification of CAS.
PXD027127	34448265	Proteomic analysis of machine perfusion solution from brain dead donor kidneys reveals that elevated complement, cytoskeleton and lipid metabolism proteins are associated with 1-year outcome. 	PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS OF MACHINE PERFUSION SOLUTION FROM BRAIN DEAD DONOR KIDNEYS REVEALS THAT COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH 1-YEAR OUTCOME	PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS OF MACHINE PERFUSION SOLUTION FROM BRAIN DEAD DONOR KIDNEYS REVEALS THAT COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH 1-YEAR OUTCOME	Assessment of donor kidney quality is based on clinical scores or requires biopsies for histological assessment. Noninvasive strategies to identify and predict graft outcome at an early stage are, therefore, needed. We evaluated the perfusate of donation after brain death (DBD) kidneys during nonoxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP). In particular, we compared perfusate protein profiles of good outcome (GO) and suboptimal outcome (SO) 1-year post-transplantation. Samples taken 15 min after the start HMP (T1) and before the termination of HMP (T2) were analysed using quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Hierarchical clustering of the 100 most abundant proteins showed discrimination between grafts with a GO and SO at T1. Elevated levels of proteins involved in classical complement cascades at both T1 and T2 and a reduced abundance of lipid metabolism at T1 and of cytoskeletal proteins at T2 in GO versus SO was observed. ATP-citrate synthase and fatty acid-binding protein 5 (T1) and immunoglobulin heavy variable 2-26 and desmoplakin (T2) showed 91% and 86% predictive values, respectively, for transplant outcome. Taken together, DBD kidney HMP perfusate profiles can distinguish between outcome 1-year post-transplantation. Furthermore, it provides insights into mechanisms that could play a role in post-transplant outcomes.
PXD025706	34450330	Effect of resveratrol on the biofilm formation and physiological properties of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli. 	Effect of resveratrol on avian pathogenic Escherichia coli	Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli, Biofilm, Lab-free analysis, Resveratrol	Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) is widely distributed, causing great economic losses to the poultry industry. The formation of APEC biofilms causes chronic, persistent, and repeated infections in the clinic, making treatment difficult. Resveratrol is a natural product, which has good health benefits including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and cardiovascular activities. Resveratrol shows efficient inhibition of bacterial biofilm formation. However, a comprehensive understanding of the proteomic properties of APEC treated resveratrol is still lacking. In this study, APEC cells treated by resveratrol were investigated using a label-free differential proteomic method. Several proteins, including those related to a two-component system and chemotaxis, were found to be implicated in APEC biofilm formation. In addition, the physiological properties were significantly changed in terms of purine, pyruvate, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism in APEC. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD025706. We speculated that pyruvate dehydrogenase might be a potential target to inhibit Escherichia coli biofilm formation. Overall, our results indicated that resveratrol inhibits APEC biofilm formation by regulating the levels of proteins in two-component systems, especially chemotaxis proteins. The results showed that resveratrol had a potential application in inhibiting the biofilm formation of APEC. SIGNIFICANCE: This study elucidated the mechanism of resveratrol inhibiting biofilm formation of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) based on a label-free differential proteomics. It was indicated that resveratrol inhibits APEC biofilm formation by regulating the levels of proteins in two component systems, especially chemotaxis proteins. Meanwhile, we speculated that pyruvate dehydrogenase might be a potential target to inhibit Escherichia coli biofilm formation. It shows that resveratrol has a potential application prospect in inhibiting the biofilm formation of APEC.
PXD025209	34452907	Structure of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) p110gamma-p101 complex reveals molecular mechanism of GPCR activation. 	Structure of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p110ï§-p101 complex reveals molecular mechanism of GPCR activation	GPCR, HDX, PIK3g, cryo-EM	The class IB phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), PI3Kgamma, is a master regulator of immune cell function and a promising drug target for both cancer and inflammatory diseases. Critical to PI3Kgamma function is the association of the p110gamma catalytic subunit to either a p101 or p84 regulatory subunit, which mediates activation by G protein-coupled receptors. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a heterodimeric PI3Kgamma complex, p110gamma-p101. This structure reveals a unique assembly of catalytic and regulatory subunits that is distinct from other class I PI3K complexes. p101 mediates activation through its Gbetagamma-binding domain, recruiting the heterodimer to the membrane and allowing for engagement of a secondary Gbetagamma-binding site in p110gamma. Mutations at the p110gamma-p101 and p110gamma-adaptor binding domain interfaces enhanced Gbetagamma activation. A nanobody that specifically binds to the p101-Gbetagamma interface blocks activation, providing a novel tool to study and target p110gamma-p101-specific signaling events in vivo.
PXD024955	34453079	Identification of potential autoantigens in anti-CCP-positive and anti-CCP-negative rheumatoid arthritis using citrulline-specific protein arrays. 	Data in support of Identification of potential autoantigens in anti-CCP-positive and anti-CCP-negative rheumatoid arthritis	autoantibodies, autoimmune, citrullination, rheumatoid arthritis	The presence or absence of autoantibodies against citrullinated proteins (ACPAs) distinguishes two main groups of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with different etiologies, prognoses, disease severities, and, presumably, disease pathogenesis. The heterogeneous responses of RA patients to various biologics, even among ACPA-positive patients, emphasize the need for further stratification of the patients. We used high-density protein array technology for fingerprinting of ACPA reactivity. Identification of the proteome recognized by ACPAs may be a step to stratify RA patients according to immune reactivity. Pooled plasma samples from 10 anti-CCP-negative and 15 anti-CCP-positive RA patients were assessed for ACPA content using a modified protein microarray containing 1631 different natively folded proteins citrullinated in situ by protein arginine deiminases (PADs) 2 and PAD4. IgG antibodies from anti-CCP-positive RA plasma showed high-intensity binding to 87 proteins citrullinated by PAD2 and 99 proteins citrullinated by PAD4 without binding significantly to the corresponding native proteins. Curiously, the binding of IgG antibodies in anti-CCP-negative plasma was also enhanced by PAD2- and PAD4-mediated citrullination of 29 and 26 proteins, respectively. For only four proteins, significantly more ACPA binding occurred after citrullination with PAD2 compared to citrullination with PAD4, while the opposite was true for one protein. We demonstrate that PAD2 and PAD4 are equally efficient in generating citrullinated autoantigens recognized by ACPAs. Patterns of proteins recognized by ACPAs may serve as a future diagnostic tool for further subtyping of RA patients.
PXD025505	34453168	Functional meta-omics provide critical insights into long- and short-read assemblies. 	Synergistic effect of short- and long-read sequencing on functional meta-omics	functional omics, gdb_metap, long-reads, metaproteomics	Real-world evaluations of metagenomic reconstructions are challenged by distinguishing reconstruction artifacts from genes and proteins present in situ. Here, we evaluate short-read-only, long-read-only and hybrid assembly approaches on four different metagenomic samples of varying complexity. We demonstrate how different assembly approaches affect gene and protein inference, which is particularly relevant for downstream functional analyses. For a human gut microbiome sample, we use complementary metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic data to assess the metagenomic data-based protein predictions. Our findings pave the way for critical assessments of metagenomic reconstructions. We propose a reference-independent solution, which exploits the synergistic effects of multi-omic data integration for the in situ study of microbiomes using long-read sequencing data.
PXD025982	34453389	RapiGest precipitation depends on peptide concentration. 	RapiGest Precipitation Depends on Peptide Concentration	LC-MS, RapiGest, detergent, in-solution digestion, precipitation	The mass spectrometry-compatible surfactant RapiGest promotes the enzymatic digestion of proteins by facilitating their unfolding while retaining enzymatic activity. RapiGest consists of a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail, which can be separated by acid hydrolysis. This allows for removal of RapiGest prior to mass spectrometric analysis via precipitation and solid phase extraction. During in-solution digestion experiments with RapiGest, we noticed a high variability in the formation of precipitates after acid hydrolysis, implying that RapiGest precipitation is sample-dependent. We show that RapiGest hydrolyses efficiently under acidic conditions and that differences in precipitation are solely due to protein/peptide concentration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RapiGest precipitation can be triggered by the addition of intact proteins, providing a strategy for its efficient removal from highly diluted samples. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025982.
PXD025518	34453585	Meta-proteomic analysis of the Shandrin mammoth by EVA technology and high-resolution mass spectrometry: what is its gut microbiota telling us? 	Proteomic Analysis of the Shandrin Mammoth by EVA Technology and High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry:  What is its Gut Telling Us?	Paleoproteomic, deamidation, high-resolution mass spectrometry, mammoth, non-invasive technique	During the last decade, paleoproteomics allowed us to open a direct window into the biological past, improving our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of extant and extinct species, past human diseases, and reconstruction of the human diet. In particular, meta-proteomic studies, mainly carried out on ancient human dental calculus, provided insights into past oral microbial communities and ancient diets. On the contrary, very few investigations regard the analysis of ancient gut microbiota, which may enable a greater understanding of how microorganisms and their hosts have co-evolved and spread under the influence of changing diet practices and habitat. In this respect, this paper reports the results of the first-ever meta-proteomic analysis carried out on a gut tissue sample some 40,000 years old. Proteins were extracted by applying EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) films to the surface of the gut sample of a woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenus), discovered in 1972 close to the Shandrin River (Yakutia, Russia), and then investigated via a shotgun MS-based approach. Proteomic and peptidomic analysis allowed in-depth exploration of its meta-proteome composition. The results were validated through the level of deamidation and other diagenetic chemical modifications of the sample peptides, which were used to discriminate the "original" endogenous peptides from contaminant ones. Overall, the results of the meta-proteomic analysis here reported agreeing with the previous paleobotanical studies and with the reconstructed habitat of the Shandrin mammoth and provided insight into its diet. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier < PXD025518 > .
PXD016844	34454597	The parasite Schistocephalus solidus secretes proteins with putative host manipulation functions. 	Proteomic analysis of the secretome of Schistocephalus solidus LC-MS/MS	LCMSMS, Schistocephalus solidus, secretome, worm	BACKGROUND: Manipulative parasites are thought to liberate molecules in their external environment, acting as manipulation factors with biological functions implicated in their host's physiological and behavioural alterations. These manipulation factors are part of a complex mixture called the secretome. While the secretomes of various parasites have been described, there is very little data for a putative manipulative parasite. It is necessary to study the molecular interaction between a manipulative parasite and its host to better understand how such alterations evolve. METHODS: Here, we used proteomics to characterize the secretome of a model cestode with a complex life cycle based on trophic transmission. We studied Schistocephalus solidus during the life stage in which behavioural changes take place in its obligatory intermediate fish host, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We produced a novel genome sequence and assembly of S. solidus to improve protein coding gene prediction and annotation for this parasite. We then described the whole worm's proteome and its secretome during fish host infection using LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: A total of 2290 proteins were detected in the proteome of S. solidus, and 30 additional proteins were detected specifically in the secretome. We found that the secretome contains proteases, proteins with neural and immune functions, as well as proteins involved in cell communication. We detected receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatases, which were reported in other parasitic systems to be manipulation factors. We also detected 12 S. solidus-specific proteins in the secretome that may play important roles in host-parasite interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that S. solidus liberates molecules with putative host manipulation functions in the host and that many of them are species-specific.
PXD024919	34455931	Identification of Allobaculum mucolyticum as a novel human intestinal mucin degrader. 	Allobaculum mucolyticum is a novel mucin degrader	Allobaculum mucolyticum, IBD, secretome	The human gut microbiota plays a central role in intestinal health and disease. Yet, many of its bacterial constituents are functionally still largely unexplored. A crucial prerequisite for bacterial survival and proliferation is the creation and/or exploitation of an own niche. For many bacterial species that are linked to human disease, the inner mucus layer was found to be an important niche. Allobaculum mucolyticum is a newly identified, IBD-associated species that is thought be closely associated with the host epithelium. To explore how this bacterium is able to effectively colonize this niche, we screened its genome for factors that may contribute to mucosal colonization. Up to 60 genes encoding putative Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZymes) were identified in the genome of A. mucolyticum. Mass spectrometry revealed 49 CAZymes of which 26 were significantly enriched in its secretome. Functional assays demonstrated the presence of CAZyme activity in A. mucolyticum conditioned medium, degradation of human mucin O-glycans, and utilization of liberated non-terminal monosaccharides for bacterial growth. The results support a model in which sialidases and fucosidases remove terminal O-glycan sugars enabling subsequent degradation and utilization of carbohydrates for A. mucolyticum growth. A. mucolyticum CAZyme secretion may thus facilitate bacterial colonization and degradation of the mucus layer and may pose an interesting target for future therapeutic intervention.
PXD019930	34458755	Glycosylated cyclophellitol-derived activity-based probes and inhibitors for cellulases. 	Glycosylated cyclophellitol-derived activity-based probes and inhibitors for cellulases	ABPP, activity-based probe, cellulases, cyclophellitol	Cellulases and related beta-1,4-glucanases are essential components of lignocellulose-degrading enzyme mixtures. The detection of beta-1,4-glucanase activity typically relies on monitoring the breakdown of purified lignocellulose-derived substrates or synthetic chromogenic substrates, limiting the activities which can be detected and complicating the tracing of activity back to specific components within complex enzyme mixtures. As a tool for the rapid detection and identification of beta-1,4-glucanases, a series of glycosylated cyclophellitol inhibitors mimicking beta-1,4-glucan oligosaccharides have been synthesised. These compounds are highly efficient inhibitors of HiCel7B, a well-known GH7 endo-beta-1,4-glucanase. An elaborated activity-based probe facilitated the direct detection and identification of beta-1,4-glucanases within a complex fungal secretome without any detectable cross-reactivity with beta-d-glucosidases. These probes and inhibitors add valuable new capacity to the growing toolbox of cyclophellitol-derived probes for the activity-based profiling of biomass-degrading enzymes.
PXD025622	34460038	Deep Succinylproteomics of Brain Tissues from Intracerebral Hemorrhage with Inhibition of Toll-Like Receptor 4 Signaling. 	Deep Succinylproteomics of Brain Tissues of Intracerebral Hemorrhage with inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling	Intracerebral hemorrhage, Toll-like receptor 4, brain injury, succinylation	It is unclear how Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling affects protein succinylation in the brain after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Here, we constructed a mouse ICH model to investigate the changes in ICH-associated brain protein succinylation, following a treatment with a TLR4 antagonist, TAK242, using a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based, quantitative succinyllysine proteomics approach. We characterized the prevalence of approximately 6700 succinylation events and quantified approximately 3500 sites, highlighting 139 succinyllysine site changes in 40 pathways. Further analysis showed that TAK242 treatment induced an increase of 29 succinyllysine sites on 28 succinylated proteins and a reduction of 24 succinyllysine sites on 23 succinylated proteins in the ICH brains. TAK242 treatment induced both protein hypersuccinylations and hyposuccinylations, which were mainly located in the mitochondria and cytoplasm. GO analysis showed that TAK242 treatment-induced changes in the ICH-associated succinylated proteins were mostly located in synapses, membranes and vesicles, and enriched in many cellular functions/compartments, such as metabolism, synapse, and myelin. KEGG analysis showed that TAK242-induced hyposuccinylation was mainly linked to fatty acid metabolism, including elongation and degradation. Moreover, a combined analysis of the succinylproteomic data with previously published transcriptome data revealed that most of the differentially succinylated proteins induced by TAK242 treatment were mainly distributed throughout neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, and the mRNAs of seven and three succinylated proteins were highly expressed in neurons and astrocytes, respectively. In conclusion, we revealed that several TLR4 signaling pathways affect the succinylation processes and pathways in mouse ICH brains, providing new insights on the ICH pathophysiological processes. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025622.
PXD023816	34460149	The fungivorous amoeba Protostelium aurantium targets redox homeostasis and cell wall integrity during intracellular killing of Candida parapsilosis. 	The fungivorous phagocyte Protostelium aurantium targets redox homeostasis and cell wall integrity during intracellular killing of Candida parapsilosis	Candida parapsilosis, Protostelium, amoeba, predation, redox homeostasis	Predatory interactions among microbes are major evolutionary driving forces for biodiversity. The fungivorous amoeba Protostelium aurantium has a wide fungal food spectrum including foremost pathogenic members of the genus Candida. Here we show that upon phagocytic ingestion by the amoeba, Candida parapsilosis is confronted with an oxidative burst and undergoes lysis within minutes of processing in acidified phagolysosomes. On the fungal side, a functional genomic approach identified copper and redox homeostasis as primary targets of amoeba predation, with the highly expressed copper exporter gene CRP1 and the peroxiredoxin gene PRX1 contributing to survival when encountered with P. aurantium. The fungicidal activity was largely retained in intracellular vesicles of the amoebae. Following their isolation, the content of these vesicles induced immediate killing and lysis of C. parapsilosis in vitro. Proteomic analysis identified 56 vesicular proteins from P. aurantium. Although completely unknown proteins were dominant, many of them could be categorised as hydrolytic enzymes targeting the fungal cell wall, indicating that fungal cell wall structures are under selection pressure by predatory phagocytes in natural environments. TAKE AWAY: The amoeba Protostelium aurantium feeds on fungi, such as Candida parapsilosis. Ingested yeast cells are exposed to reactive oxygen species. A copper exporter and a peroxiredoxin contribute to fungal defence. Yeast cells undergo intracellular lysis. Lysis occurs via a cocktail of hydrolytic enzymes from intracellular vesicles.
PXD021662	34461091	Aim32 is a dual-localized 2Fe-2S mitochondrial protein that functions in redox quality control. 	AIM32 is a dual-localized 2Fe-2S mitochondrial protein that functions in redox quality control	Aim32, Oxa1, TIM22, TIM23, mitochondrion is complex. mass spectrometry	Yeast is a facultative anaerobe and uses diverse electron acceptors to maintain redox-regulated import of cysteine-rich precursors via the mitochondrial intermembrane space assembly (MIA) pathway. With the growing diversity of substrates utilizing the MIA pathway, understanding the capacity of the intermembrane space (IMS) to handle different types of stress is crucial. We used MS to identify additional proteins that interacted with the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 of the MIA pathway. Altered inheritance of mitochondria 32 (Aim32), a thioredoxin-like [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin protein, was identified as an Erv1-binding protein. Detailed localization studies showed that Aim32 resided in both the mitochondrial matrix and IMS. Aim32 interacted with additional proteins including redox protein Osm1 and protein import components Tim17, Tim23, and Tim22. Deletion of Aim32 or mutation of conserved cysteine residues that coordinate the Fe-S center in Aim32 resulted in an increased accumulation of proteins with aberrant disulfide linkages. In addition, the steady-state level of assembled TIM22, TIM23, and Oxa1 protein import complexes was decreased. Aim32 also bound to several mitochondrial proteins under nonreducing conditions, suggesting a function in maintaining the redox status of proteins by potentially targeting cysteine residues that may be sensitive to oxidation. Finally, Aim32 was essential for growth in conditions of stress such as elevated temperature and hydroxyurea, and under anaerobic conditions. These studies suggest that the Fe-S protein Aim32 has a potential role in general redox homeostasis in the matrix and IMS. Thus, Aim32 may be poised as a sensor or regulator in quality control for a broad range of mitochondrial proteins.
PXD025155	34461092	Marine bacterial exopolysaccharide EPS11 inhibits migration and invasion of liver cancer cells by directly targeting collagen I. 	Marine bacterial polysaccharide EPS11 inhibits metastasis and invasion of liver cancer cells by directly targeting type I collagen	collagen, liver cancer, polysaccharide	Many natural polysaccharides have significant anticancer activity with low toxicity, but the complex chemical structures make in-depth studies of the involved mechanisms extremely difficult. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the marine bacterial exopolysaccharide (exopolysaccharide 11 [EPS11]) on liver cancer metastasis to explore the underlying target protein and molecular mechanism. We found that EPS11 significantly suppressed cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in liver cancer cells. Proteomic analysis showed that EPS11 induced downregulation of proteins related to the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction signaling pathway. In addition, the direct pharmacological target of EPS11 was identified as collagen I using cellular thermal shift assays. Surface plasmon resonance and pull-down assays further confirmed the specific binding of EPS11 to collagen I. Moreover, EPS11 was shown to inhibit tumor metastasis by directly modulating collagen I activity via the beta1-integrin-mediated signaling pathway. Collectively, our study demonstrated for the first time that collagen I could be a direct pharmacological target of polysaccharide drugs. Moreover, directly targeting collagen I may be a promising strategy for finding novel carbohydrate-based drugs.
PXD026941	34461102	Proteomic analysis demonstrates the role of the quality control protease LONP1 in mitochondrial protein aggregation. 	Proteomic analysis of the role of the quality control protease LONP1 in mitochondrial protein aggregation	Genetic alteration via Crispr/CAS, Heat stress, LONP1 ATP-dependent protease, Protein aggregation, Protein degradation, mitochondria	The mitochondrial matrix protease LONP1 is an essential part of the organellar protein quality control system. LONP1 has been shown to be involved in respiration control and apoptosis. Furthermore, a reduction in LONP1 level correlates with aging. Up to now, the effects of a LONP1 defect were mostly studied by utilizing transient, siRNA-mediated knockdown approaches. We generated a new cellular model system for studying the impact of LONP1 on mitochondrial protein homeostasis by a CRISPR/Cas-mediated genetic knockdown (gKD). These cells showed a stable reduction of LONP1 along with a mild phenotype characterized by absent morphological differences and only small negative effects on mitochondrial functions under normal culture conditions. To assess the consequences of a permanent LONP1 depletion on the mitochondrial proteome, we analyzed the alterations of protein levels by quantitative mass spectrometry, demonstrating small adaptive changes, in particular with respect to mitochondrial protein biogenesis. In an additional proteomic analysis, we determined the temperature-dependent aggregation behavior of mitochondrial proteins and its dependence on a reduction of LONP1 activity, demonstrating the important role of the protease for mitochondrial protein homeostasis in mammalian cells. We identified a significant number of mitochondrial proteins that are affected by a reduced LONP1 activity especially with respect to their stress-induced solubility. Taken together, our results suggest a very good applicability of the LONP1 gKD cell line as a model system for human aging processes.
PXD021147	34462518	The human type 2 diabetes-specific visceral adipose tissue proteome and transcriptome in obesity. 	The human diabetes-specific visceral adipose tissue proteome: insights into mechanisms of adipose tissue dysfunction in metabolic disease	adipose tissue, diabetes, mitochondria, obesity, visceral	Dysfunctional visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes (DM) but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our objective in this discovery analysis was to identify genes and proteins regulated by DM to elucidate aberrant cellular metabolic and signaling mediators. We performed label-free proteomics and RNA-sequencing analysis of VAT from female bariatric surgery subjects with DM and without DM (NDM). We quantified 1965 protein groups, 23 proteins, and 372 genes that were differently abundant in DM vs. NDM VAT. Proteins downregulated in DM were related to fatty acid synthesis and mitochondrial function (fatty acid synthase, FASN; dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, mitochondrial, E3 component, DLD; succinate dehydrogenase-alpha, SDHA) while proteins upregulated in DM were associated with innate immunity and transcriptional regulation (vitronectin, VTN; endothelial protein C receptor, EPCR; signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B, STAT5B). Transcriptome indicated defects in innate inflammation, lipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix (ECM) function, and components of complement classical and alternative cascades. The VAT proteome and transcriptome shared 13 biological processes impacted by DM, related to complement activation, cell proliferation and migration, ECM organization, lipid metabolism, and gluconeogenesis. Our data revealed a marked effect of DM in downregulating FASN. We also demonstrate enrichment of complement factor B (CFB), coagulation factor XIII A chain (F13A1), thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), and integrins at mRNA and protein levels, albeit with lower q-values and lack of Western blot or PCR confirmation. Our findings suggest putative mechanisms of VAT dysfunction in DM.
PXD026907	34462546	Comparative analysis of therapeutic effects between medium cut-off and high flux dialyzers using metabolomics and proteomics: exploratory, prospective study in hemodialysis. 	Comparative analysis of therapeutic effects between medium cut-off and high flux dialyzers using metabolomics and proteomics	Homodialysis, Plasma, SWATH-MS	In this single-center prospective study of 20 patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD), we compared the therapeutic effects of medium cut-off (MCO) and high flux (HF) dialyzers using metabolomics and proteomics. A consecutive dialyzer membrane was used for 15-week study periods: 1st HF dialyzer, MCO dialyzer, 2nd HF dialyzer, for 5 weeks respectively. (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance was used to identify the metabolites and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was used to identify proteins. To compare the effects of the HF and MCO dialyzers, orthogonal projection to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed. OPLS-DA showed that metabolite characteristics could be significantly classified by 1st HF and MCO dialyzers. The Pre-HD metabolites with variable importance in projection scores >= 1.0 in both 1st HF versus MCO and MCO versus 2nd HF were succinate, glutamate, and histidine. The pre-HD levels of succinate and histidine were significantly lower, while those of glutamate were significantly higher in MCO period than in the HF period. OPLS-DA of the proteome also substantially separated 1st HF and MCO periods. Plasma pre-HD levels of fibronectin 1 were significantly higher, and those of complement component 4B and retinol-binding protein 4 were significantly lower in MCO than in the 1st HF period. Interestingly, as per Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, an increase in epithelial cell proliferation and a decrease in endothelial cell apoptosis occurred during the MCO period. Overall, our results suggest that the use of MCO dialyzers results in characteristic metabolomics and proteomics profiles during HD compared with HF dialyzers, which might be related to oxidative stress, insulin resistance, complement-coagulation axis, inflammation, and nutrition.
PXD026329	34465866	YBX1 mediates translation of oncogenic transcripts to control cell competition in AML. 	YBX1 mediates translation of oncogenic transcripts to control cell competition in AML	AML, Oncogene, Translation, YBX1	Persistence of malignant clones is a major determinant of adverse outcome in patients with hematologic malignancies. Despite the fact that the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) achieve complete remission after chemotherapy, a large proportion of them relapse as a result of residual malignant cells. These persistent clones have a competitive advantage and can re-establish disease. Therefore, targeting strategies that specifically diminish cell competition of malignant cells while leaving normal cells unaffected are clearly warranted. Recently, our group identified YBX1 as a mediator of disease persistence in JAK2-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms. The role of YBX1 in AML, however, remained so far elusive. Here, inactivation of YBX1 confirms its role as an essential driver of leukemia development and maintenance. We identify its ability to amplify the translation of oncogenic transcripts, including MYC, by recruitment to polysomal chains. Genetic inactivation of YBX1 disrupts this regulatory circuit and displaces oncogenic drivers from polysomes, with subsequent depletion of protein levels. As a consequence, leukemia cells show reduced proliferation and are out-competed in vitro and in vivo, while normal cells remain largely unaffected. Collectively, these data establish YBX1 as a specific dependency and therapeutic target in AML that is essential for oncogenic protein expression.
PXD027117	34465899	Artificial sweeteners stimulate horizontal transfer of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes through natural transformation. 	Proteomic analysis of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 under exposure to artificial sweeteners	artificial sweeteners, competence, transformation	Antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a global threat to human health. Natural transformation is an important pathway for horizontal gene transfer, which facilitates the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacteria. Although it is suspected that artificial sweeteners could exert antimicrobial effects, little is known whether artificial sweeteners would also affect horizontal transfer of ARGs via transformation. Here we demonstrate that four commonly used artificial sweeteners (saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and acesulfame potassium) promote transfer of ARGs via natural transformation in Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1, a model organism for studying competence and transformation. Such phenomenon was also found in a Gram-positive human pathogen Bacillus subtilis and mice faecal microbiome. We reveal that exposure to these sweeteners increases cell envelope permeability and results in an upregulation of genes encoding DNA uptake and translocation (Com) machinery. In addition, we find that artificial sweeteners induce an increase in plasmid persistence in transformants. We propose a mathematical model established to predict the long-term effects on transformation dynamics under exposure to these sweeteners. Collectively, our findings offer insights into natural transformation promoted by artificial sweeteners and highlight the need to evaluate these environmental contaminants for their antibiotic-like side effects.
PXD021277	34466782	A modified density gradient proteomic-based method to analyze endolysosomal proteins in cardiac tissue. 	Cardiac Atrial Compartmentalisation Proteomics: A Modified Density Gradient Method to Analyse Endo-lysosomal Proteins	Guinea-pig, RAB proteins, atria, cardiac, lysosome, lysosome storage disease	The importance of lysosomes in cardiac physiology and pathology is well established, and evidence for roles in calcium signaling is emerging. We describe a label-free proteomics method suitable for small cardiac tissue biopsies based on density-separated fractionation, which allows study of endolysosomal (EL) proteins. Density gradient fractions corresponding to tissue lysate; sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), mitochondria (Mito) (1.3 g/mL); and EL with negligible contamination from SR or Mito (1.04 g/mL) were analyzed using Western blot, enzyme activity assay, and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis (adapted discontinuous Percoll and sucrose differential density gradient). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Reactome, Panther, and Gene Ontology pathway analysis showed good coverage of RAB proteins and lysosomal cathepsins (including cardiac-specific cathepsin D) in the purified EL fraction. Significant EL proteins recovered included catalytic activity proteins. We thus present a comprehensive protocol and data set of guinea pig atrial EL organelle proteomics using techniques also applicable for non-cardiac tissue.
PXD022199	34467332	A Chemical Toolbox for Labeling and Degrading Engineered Cas Proteins. 	Proteomics analysis of a new Cas9-targeting PROTAC molecule	CRISPR-Cas9, PROTAC, Qexactive HF	The discovery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and their associated proteins (Cas) has revolutionized the field of genome and epigenome editing. A number of new methods have been developed to precisely control the function and activity of Cas proteins, including fusion proteins and small-molecule modulators. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represent a new concept using the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade a protein of interest, highlighting the significance of chemically induced protein-E3 ligase interaction in drug discovery. Here, we engineered Cas proteins (Cas9, dCas9, Cas12, and Cas13) by inserting a Phe-Cys-Pro-Phe (FCPF) amino acid sequence (known as the pi-clamp system) and demonstrate that the modified Cas(FCPF) proteins can be (1) labeled in live cells by perfluoroaromatics carrying the fluorescein or (2) degraded by a perfluoroaromatics-functionalized PROTAC (PROTAC-FCPF). A proteome-wide analysis of PROTAC-FCPF-mediated Cas9(FCPF) protein degradation revealed a high target specificity, suggesting a wide range of applications of perfluoroaromatics-induced proximity in the regulation of stability, activity, and functionality of any FCPF-tagging protein.
PXD027203	34469172	Rabbit Antidiethoxyphosphotyrosine Antibody, Made by Single B Cell Cloning, Detects Chlorpyrifos Oxon-Modified Proteins in Cultured Cells and Immunopurifies Modified Peptides for Mass Spectrometry. 	Evaluation of mass spectrometry MS/MS spectra for the presence of isopeptide crosslinked peptides	MAP-rich tubulin, Protein Prospector, crosslinks, dansyl cadaverine, dansyl-aminohexyl QQIV, isopeptide, neurodegenerative disease, transglutaminase	Chronic low-dose exposure to organophosphorus pesticides is associated with the risk of neurodegenerative disease. The mechanism of neurotoxicity is independent of acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Adducts on tyrosine, lysine, threonine, and serine can occur after exposure to organophosphorus pesticides, the most stable being adducts on tyrosine. Rabbit monoclonal 1C6 to diethoxyphosphate-modified tyrosine (depY) was created by single B cell cloning. The amino acid sequence and binding constant (Kd 3.2 x 10(-8) M) were determined. Cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells incubated with a subcytotoxic dose of 10 muM chlorpyrifos oxon contained depY-modified proteins detected by monoclonal 1C6 on Western blots. depY-labeled peptides from tryptic digests of cell lysates were immunopurified by binding to immobilized 1C6. Peptides released with 50% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. Protein Prospector database searches identified 51 peptides modified on tyrosine by diethoxyphosphate in SH-SY5Y cell lysate and 73 diethoxyphosphate-modified peptides in N2a cell lysate. Adducts appeared most frequently on the cytoskeleton proteins tubulin, actin, and vimentin. It was concluded that rabbit monoclonal 1C6 can be useful for studies that aim to understand the mechanism of neurotoxicity resulting from low-dose exposure to organophosphorus pesticides.
PXD023221	34469738	FAN1 controls mismatch repair complex assembly via MLH1 retention to stabilize CAG repeat expansion in Huntington's disease. 	Dual FAN1 activities stabilize the HTT CAG repeat	Crosslinking, FAN1	CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene drives Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis and is modulated by DNA damage repair pathways. In this context, the interaction between FAN1, a DNA-structure-specific nuclease, and MLH1, member of the DNA mismatch repair pathway (MMR), is not defined. Here, we identify a highly conserved SPYF motif at the N terminus of FAN1 that binds to MLH1. Our data support a model where FAN1 has two distinct functions to stabilize CAG repeats. On one hand, it binds MLH1 to restrict its recruitment by MSH3, thus inhibiting the assembly of a functional MMR complex that would otherwise promote CAG repeat expansion. On the other hand, it promotes accurate repair via its nuclease activity. These data highlight a potential avenue for HD therapeutics in attenuating somatic expansion.
PXD019472	34472326	Exposure to an Environmental Mixture of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Induces Hepatic Cytochrome P450 Enzymes in Mice. 	Induction of active hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes in mice exposed to benzo[a]pyrene or environmental mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons	chemoproteomics, cytochrome P450, enyzme induction, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons	Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) play an important role in bioactivating or detoxifying polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), common environmental contaminants. While it is widely accepted that exposure to PAHs induces CYPs, effectively increasing rates of xenobiotic metabolism, dose- and time-response patterns of CYP induction are not well-known. In order to better understand dose- and time-response relationships of individual CYPs following induction, we exposed B6129SF1/J mice to single or repeated doses (2-180 mumol/kg/d) of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) or Supermix-10, a mixture of the top 10 most abundant PAHs found at the Portland Harbor Superfund Site. In hepatic microsomes from exposed mice, we measured amounts of active CYPs using activity-based protein profiling and total CYP expression using global proteomics. We observed rapid Cyp1a1 induction after 6 h at the lowest PAH exposures and broad induction of many CYPs after 3 daily PAH doses at 72 h following the first dose. Using samples displaying Cyp1a1 induction, we observed significantly higher metabolic affinity for BaP metabolism (Km reduced 3-fold), 3-fold higher intrinsic clearance, but no changes to the Vmax. Mice dosed with the highest PAH exposures exhibited 1.7-5-fold higher intrinsic clearance rates for BaP compared to controls and higher Vmax values indicating greater amounts of enzymes capable of metabolizing BaP. This study demonstrates exposure to PAHs found at superfund sites induces enzymes in dose- and time-dependent patterns in mice. Accounting for specific changes in enzyme profiles, relative rates of PAH bioactivation and detoxification, and resulting risk will help translate internal dosimetry of animal models to humans and improve risk assessments of PAHs at superfund sites.
PXD023362	34472763	Identification of intracellular glycosaminoglycan-interacting proteins by affinity purification mass spectrometry. 	Identification of intracellular glycosaminoglycan-interacting proteins by affinity purification mass spectrometry	SaOS2/osteoblast cell line, biotin-GAG, hBMSC, pull-down approach, sulfated glycosaminoglycan derivatives	Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are essential functional components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Artificial GAGs like sulfated hyaluronan (sHA) exhibit pro-osteogenic properties and boost healing processes. Hence, they are of high interest for supporting bone regeneration and wound healing. Although sulfated GAGs (sGAGs) appear intracellularly, the knowledge about intracellular effects and putative interaction partners is scarce. Here we used an affinity-purification mass spectrometry-based (AP-MS) approach to identify novel and particularly intracellular sGAG-interacting proteins in human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC). Overall, 477 proteins were found interacting with at least one of four distinct sGAGs. Enrichment analysis for protein localization showed that mainly intracellular and cell-associated interacting proteins were identified. The interaction of sGAG with alpha2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein (LRPAP1), exportin-1 (XPO1), and serine protease HTRA1 (HTRA1) was confirmed in reverse assays. Consecutive pathway and cluster analysis led to the identification of biological processes, namely processes involving binding and processing of nucleic acids, LRP1-dependent endocytosis, and exosome formation. Respecting the preferentially intracellular localization of sGAG in vesicle-like structures, also the interaction data indicate sGAG-specific modulation of vesicle-based transport processes. By identifying many sGAG-specific interacting proteins, our data provide a resource for upcoming studies aimed at molecular mechanisms and understanding of sGAG cellular effects.
PXD026600	34472865	Extensive and Accurate Benchmarking of DIA Acquisition Methods and Software Tools Using a Complex Proteomic Standard. 	Extensive and accurate benchmarking of DIA acquisition methods and softwares using a complex 	DIA workflow, benchmark, proteomic standard, quantitication	Over the past decade, the data-independent acquisition mode has gained popularity for broad coverage of complex proteomes by LC-MS/MS and quantification of low-abundance proteins. However, there is no consensus in the literature on the best data acquisition parameters and processing tools to use for this specific application. Here, we present the most comprehensive comparison of DIA workflows on Orbitrap instruments published so far in the field of proteomics. Using a standard human 48 proteins mixture (UPS1-Sigma) at 8 different concentrations in an E. coli proteome background, we tested 36 workflows including 4 different DIA window acquisition schemes and 6 different software tools (DIA-NN, DIA-Umpire, OpenSWATH, ScaffoldDIA, Skyline, and Spectronaut) with or without the use of a DDA spectral library. On the basis of the number of proteins identified, quantification linearity and reproducibility, as well as sensitivity and specificity in 28 pairwise comparisons of different UPS1 concentrations, we summarize the major considerations and propose guidelines for choosing the DIA workflow best suited for LC-MS/MS proteomic analyses. Our 96 DIA raw files and software outputs have been deposited on ProteomeXchange for testing or developing new DIA processing tools.
PXD027025	34473505	Column-based Technology for CD9-HPLC Immunoaffinity Isolation of Serum Extracellular Vesicles. 	CD9-HPLC-IAC Isolation of Serum Extracellular Vesicles for Proteomic Analysis	CD9, Extracellular vesicles, HPLC, Immunoaffinity Isolation, Serum	Serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a promising source of biomarkers; however, major challenges in EV separation and proteomic profiling remain for isolating EVs from a small amount, that is, on the microliter scale, of human serum while minimizing the contamination of blood proteins and lipoprotein particles coeluting in EV preparations. Herein we have developed a column-based CD9-antibody-immobilized high-performance liquid chromatography immunoaffinity chromatography(CD9-HPLC-IAC) technology for EV isolation from a microliter scale of serum for downstream proteomic analysis. The CD9-HPLC-IAC method achieved EV isolation from 40 muL of serum in 30 min with a yield of 8.0 x 10(9) EVs, where EVs were further processed with a postcolumn cleaning step using the 50 kDa molecular weight cut-off filter for the buffer exchange, concentration, and reduction of potentially coeluting serum proteins. In total, 482 proteins were identified in EVs by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, including the common exosomal markers such as CD63, CD81, CD82, Alix, and TSG101. The statistical analysis of EV protein content showed that the top 10 serum proteins in EVs were significantly decreased by using the CD9-HPLC-IAC method compared with the use of ultracentrifugation (p = 0.001) and size exclusion chromatography (p = 0.009), and apolipoproteins were significantly reduced 4.8-fold compared with the SEC method (p < 0.001). The result demonstrates the potential of the CD9-HPLC-IAC method for the efficient isolation and proteomic characterization of EVs from a microscale volume of serum.
PXD023140	34473623	Tissue environment, not ontogeny, defines murine intestinal intraepithelial T lymphocytes. 	Tissue adaptation is the dominant driver of the proteomic landscape of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes	IEL, T cells, TMT, lymph nodes, lymphocytes	Tissue-resident intestinal intraepithelial T lymphocytes (T-IEL) patrol the gut and have important roles in regulating intestinal homeostasis. T-IEL include both induced T-IEL, derived from systemic antigen-experienced lymphocytes, and natural T-IEL, which are developmentally targeted to the intestine. While the processes driving T-IEL development have been elucidated, the precise roles of the different subsets and the processes driving activation and regulation of these cells remain unclear. To gain functional insights into these enigmatic cells, we used high-resolution, quantitative mass spectrometry to compare the proteomes of induced T-IEL and natural T-IEL subsets, with naive CD8(+) T cells from lymph nodes. This data exposes the dominant effect of the gut environment over ontogeny on T-IEL phenotypes. Analyses of protein copy numbers of >7000 proteins in T-IEL reveal skewing of the cell surface repertoire towards epithelial interactions and checkpoint receptors; strong suppression of the metabolic machinery indicating a high energy barrier to functional activation; upregulated cholesterol and lipid metabolic pathways, leading to high cholesterol levels in T-IEL; suppression of T cell antigen receptor signalling and expression of the transcription factor TOX, reminiscent of chronically activated T cells. These novel findings illustrate how T-IEL integrate multiple tissue-specific signals to maintain their homeostasis and potentially function.
PXD024161	34475432	Murine neuronatin deficiency is associated with a hypervariable food intake and bimodal obesity. 	Peptidomics of pancreas in wild type and neuronatin deficien mice	Pancreas, Peptidomics, insulin, neuronatin, prohormone processing	Neuronatin (Nnat) has previously been reported to be part of a network of imprinted genes downstream of the chromatin regulator Trim28. Disruption of Trim28 or of members of this network, including neuronatin, results in an unusual phenotype of a bimodal body weight. To better characterise this variability, we examined the key contributors to energy balance in Nnat(+/-p) mice that carry a paternal null allele and do not express Nnat. Consistent with our previous studies, Nnat deficient mice on chow diet displayed a bimodal body weight phenotype with more than 30% of Nnat(+/-p) mice developing obesity. In response to both a 45% high fat diet and exposure to thermoneutrality (30 degreesC) Nnat deficient mice maintained the hypervariable body weight phenotype. Within a calorimetry system, food intake in Nnat(+/-p) mice was hypervariable, with some mice consuming more than twice the intake seen in wild type littermates. A hyperphagic response was also seen in Nnat(+/-p) mice in a second, non-home cage environment. An expected correlation between body weight and energy expenditure was seen, but corrections for the effects of positive energy balance and body weight greatly diminished the effect of neuronatin deficiency on energy expenditure. Male and female Nnat(+/-p) mice displayed subtle distinctions in the degree of variance body weight phenotype and food intake and further sexual dimorphism was reflected in different patterns of hypothalamic gene expression in Nnat(+/-p) mice. Loss of the imprinted gene Nnat is associated with a highly variable food intake, with the impact of this phenotype varying between genetically identical individuals.
PXD013987	34476004	The miR-193a-5p/NCX2/AKT axis promotes invasion and metastasis of osteosarcoma. 	U2OS osteosarcoma cells LC-MSMS	Osteosarcoma, U2OS, miR-193a-5p	MiR-193a-5p has been observed to have oncogenic or tumor suppressive functions in different kinds of cancers, but its role and molecular mechanism in osteosarcoma are elusive. Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers (NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3) normally extrude Ca(2+) from the cell, and deregulation of the intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is related to several kinds of diseases, including cancer. The present study demonstrated that miR-193a-5p was upregulated in osteosarcoma tissues compared with the corresponding adjacent noncancerous tissues, and promoted colony formation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in osteosarcoma cells (SaOS-2 and U-2OS), as well as metastasis in a murine xenograft model. Tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics analysis identified NCX2 as a potential target of miR-193a-5p. Luciferase activity assays and Western blotting further confirmed that miR-193a-5p recognized the 3'-untranslated region of NCX2 mRNA, and negatively regulated NCX2 expression. NCX2 was downregulated in osteosarcoma tissues, and its expression was negatively correlated with miR-193a-5p levels. Ectopic expression of NCX2 in osteosarcoma cells could reverse the oncogenicity of miR-193a-5p, indicating that miR-193a-5p exerted its effects by targeting NCX2. Further study demonstrated that NCX2 suppresses Ca(2+)-dependent Akt phosphorylation by decreasing intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and then inhibited EMT process. Treatment with the antagomir against miR-193a-5p sensitized osteosarcoma to the Akt inhibitor afuresertib in a murine xenograft model. In conclusion, a miR-193a-5p/NCX2/AKT signaling axis contributes to the progression of osteosarcoma, which may provide a new therapeutic target for osteosarcoma treatment.
PXD026920	34476221	Glycopeptidomics Analysis of a Cell Line Model Revealing Pathogenesis and Potential Marker Molecules for the Early Diagnosis of Gastric MALT Lymphoma. 	Glycopeptidomics Analysis of a Cell Line Model Revealing Pathogenesis and Potential Marker Molecules for the Early Diagnosis of Gastric MALT Lymphoma	Cell line model, Gastric MALT lymphoma, Glycopeptidomics, Helicobacter pylori	Background & Aims: Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoma (GML) is a mature B cell tumor related to Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) infection. The clinical manifestations of GML are not specific, so GML is often misdiagnosed, leading to excessive treatment. The pathogenesis of H.pylori-induced GML is not well understood and there are no molecular markers for early GML diagnosis. Methods: Glycopeptidomics analyses of host cell lines (a BCG823 cell line, C823) and C823 cells infected by H. pylori isolated from patients with GML (GMALT823), gastritis (GAT823), gastric ulcer (GAU823) and gastric cancer (GAC823) were carried out to clarify the host reaction mechanism against GML and to identify potential molecular criteria for the early diagnosis of GML. Results: Thirty-three samples were analyzed and approximately 2000 proteins, 200 glycoproteins and 500 glycopeptides were detected in each sample. O-glycans were the dominant glycoforms in GMALT823 cells only. Four specific glycoforms in GMALT823 cells and 2 specific glycoforms in C823 and GMALT823 cells were identified. Eight specific glycopeptides from 7 glycoproteins were found in GMALT823 cells; of these glycopeptides, 6 and 3 specific glycopeptides had high affinity for T cell epitopes and have conformational B cell epitopes, respectively. Conclusion: The predominant glycoforms of host cells infected by MALT H. pylori isolates differ from others, and the glycoproteins, glycosylation sites and glycoforms might be closely related to the formation of GML, which provides new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of H. pylori infection and suggests molecular indicators for the early diagnosis of GML.
PXD022697	34478875	Characterization of R-Loop-Interacting Proteins in Embryonic Stem Cells Reveals Roles in rRNA Processing and Gene Expression. 	Characterization of R-loop-interacting proteins in embryonic stem cells reveals roles in ribosomal RNA processing and gene expression	R-loop-interacting proteins, RNA-protein crosslinking, immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry approach	Chromatin-associated RNAs have diverse roles in the nucleus. However, their mechanisms of action are poorly understood, in part because of the inability to identify proteins that specifically associate with chromatin-bound RNAs. Here, we address this problem for a subset of chromatin-associated RNAs that form R-loops-RNA-DNA hybrid structures that include a displaced strand of ssDNA. R-loops generally form cotranscriptionally and have important roles in regulation of gene expression, immunoglobulin class switching, and other processes. However, unresolved R-loops can lead to DNA damage and chromosome instability. To identify factors that may bind and regulate R-loop accumulation or mediate R-loop-dependent functions, we used a comparative immunoprecipitation/MS approach, with and without RNA-protein crosslinking, to identify a stringent set of R-loop-binding proteins in mouse embryonic stem cells. We identified 364 R-loop-interacting proteins, which were highly enriched for proteins with predicted RNA-binding functions. We characterized several R-loop-interacting proteins of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases and found that these proteins localize to the nucleolus and, to a lesser degree, the nucleus. Consistent with their localization patterns, we found that these helicases are required for rRNA processing and regulation of gene expression. Surprisingly, depletion of these helicases resulted in misregulation of highly overlapping sets of protein-coding genes, including many genes that function in differentiation and development. We conclude that R-loop-interacting DEAD-box helicases have nonredundant roles that are critical for maintaining the normal embryonic stem cell transcriptome.
PXD026335	34480713	Elamipretide (SS-31) treatment attenuates age-associated post-translational modifications of heart proteins. 	Mouse Heart SS-31 Proteome and Phosphoproteome	SS-31, aging, elamipretide, heart tissue, phosphoproteome	It has been demonstrated that elamipretide (SS-31) rescues age-related functional deficits in the heart but the full set of mechanisms behind this have yet to be determined. We investigated the hypothesis that elamipretide influences post-translational modifications to heart proteins. The S-glutathionylation and phosphorylation proteomes of mouse hearts were analyzed using shotgun proteomics to assess the effects of aging on these post-translational modifications and the ability of the mitochondria-targeted drug elamipretide to reverse age-related changes. Aging led to an increase in oxidation of protein thiols demonstrated by increased S-glutathionylation of cysteine residues on proteins from Old (24 months old at the start of the study) mouse hearts compared to Young (5-6 months old). This shift in the oxidation state of the proteome was almost completely reversed by 8 weeks of treatment with elamipretide. Many of the significant changes that occurred were in proteins involved in mitochondrial or cardiac function. We also found changes in the mouse heart phosphoproteome that were associated with age, some of which were partially restored with elamipretide treatment. Parallel reaction monitoring of a subset of phosphorylation sites revealed that the unmodified peptide reporting for Myot S231 increased with age, but not its phosphorylated form and that both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the peptide covering cMyBP-C S307 increased, but that elamipretide treatment did not affect these changes. These results suggest that changes to thiol redox state and phosphorylation status are two ways in which age may affect mouse heart function, which can be restored by treatment with elamipretide.
PXD023604	34480900	The yeast mitochondrial succinylome: Implications for regulation of mitochondrial nucleoids. 	Yeast mitochondrial succinylome: Implications for mitochondrial DNA maintenance	PTM, mitochondria, succinylation	Acylation modifications, such as the succinylation of lysine, are post-translational modifications and a powerful means of regulating protein activity. Some acylations occur nonenzymatically, driven by an increase in the concentration of acyl group donors. Lysine succinylation has a profound effect on the corresponding site within the protein, as it dramatically changes the charge of the residue. In eukaryotes, it predominantly affects mitochondrial proteins because the donor of succinate, succinyl-CoA, is primarily generated in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Although numerous succinylated mitochondrial proteins have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a more detailed characterization of the yeast mitochondrial succinylome is still lacking. Here, we performed a proteomic MS analysis of purified yeast mitochondria and detected 314 succinylated mitochondrial proteins with 1763 novel succinylation sites. The mitochondrial nucleoid, a complex of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial proteins, is one of the structures whose protein components are affected by succinylation. We found that Abf2p, the principal component of mitochondrial nucleoids responsible for compacting mitochondrial DNA in S. cerevisiae, can be succinylated in vivo on at least thirteen lysine residues. Abf2p succinylation in vitro inhibits its DNA-binding activity and reduces its sensitivity to digestion by the ATP-dependent ScLon protease. We conclude that changes in the metabolic state of a cell resulting in an increase in the concentration of tricarboxylic acid intermediates may affect mitochondrial functions.
PXD022720	34481086	Optimization of proteomics sample preparation for forensic analysis of skin samples. 	Optimization of Proteomics Sample Preparation for Forensic Analysis of Skin Samples	Human Forensics, Protein Extraction, Sample Preparation, Surfactants, Trypsin Digestion	We present an efficient protein extraction and in-solution enzymatic digestion protocol optimized for mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies of human skin samples. Human skin cells are a proteinaceous matrix that can enable forensic identification of individuals. We performed a systematic optimization of proteomic sample preparation for a protein-based human forensic identification application. Digestion parameters, including incubation duration, temperature, and the type and concentration of surfactant, were systematically varied to maximize digestion completeness. Through replicate digestions, parameter optimization was performed to maximize repeatability and increase the number of identified peptides and proteins. Final digestion conditions were selected based on the parameters that yielded the greatest percent of peptides with zero missed tryptic cleavages, which benefit the analysis of genetically variable peptides (GVPs). We evaluated the final digestion conditions for identification of GVPs by applying MS-based proteomics on a mixed-donor sample. The results were searched against a human proteome database appended with a database of GVPs constructed from known non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occur at known population frequencies. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potential of our proteomics sample preparation for future implementation of GVP analysis by forensic laboratories to facilitate human identification. SIGNIFICANCE: Genetically variable peptides (GVPs) can provide forensic evidence that is complementary to traditional DNA profiling and be potentially used for human identification. An efficient protein extraction and reproducible digestion method of skin proteins is a key contributor for downstream analysis of GVPs and further development of this technology in forensic application. In this study, we optimized the enzymatic digestion conditions, such as incubation time and temperature, for skin samples. Our study is among the first attempts towards optimization of proteomics sample preparation for protein-based skin identification in forensic applications such as touch samples. Our digestion method employs RapiGest (an acid-labile surfactant), trypsin enzymatic digestion, and an incubation time of 16 h at 37 degreesC.
PXD027712	34481949	A Proteomic Study on the Membrane Protein Fraction of T Cells Confirms High Substrate Selectivity for the ER Translocation Inhibitor Cyclotriazadisulfonamide. 	A proteomic study on the membrane protein fraction of T cells confirms high substrate selectivity for the ER translocation inhibitor cyclotriazadisulfonamide	CD4, ER co-translational translocation, SILAC, cyclotriazadisulfonamide (CADA), signal peptide	Cyclotriazadisulfonamide (CADA) inhibits the cotranslational translocation of type I integral membrane protein human CD4 (huCD4) across the endoplasmic reticulum in a signal peptide (SP)-dependent way. Previously, sortilin was identified as a secondary substrate for CADA but showed reduced CADA sensitivity as compared with huCD4. Here, we performed a quantitative proteomic study on the crude membrane fraction of human T-cells to analyze how many proteins are sensitive to CADA. To screen for these proteins, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture technique in combination with quantitative MS on CADA-treated human T-lymphoid SUP-T1 cells expressing high levels of huCD4. In line with our previous reports, our current proteomic analysis (data available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027712) demonstrated that only a very small subset of proteins is depleted by CADA. Our data also confirmed that cellular expression of both huCD4 and sortilin are affected by CADA treatment of SUP-T1 cells. Furthermore, three additional targets for CADA are identified, namely, endoplasmic reticulum lectin 1 (ERLEC1), inactive tyrosine-protein kinase 7 (PTK7), and DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 3 (DNAJC3). Western blot and flow cytometry analysis of ERLEC1, PTK7, and DNAJC3 protein expression validated susceptibility of these substrates to CADA, although with varying degrees of sensitivity. Additional cell-free in vitro translation/translocation data demonstrated that the new substrates for CADA carry cleavable SPs that are targets for the cotranslational translocation inhibition exerted by CADA. Thus, our quantitative proteomic analysis demonstrates that ERLEC1, PTK7, and DNAJC3 are validated additional substrates of CADA; however, huCD4 remains the most sensitive integral membrane protein for the endoplasmic reticulum translocation inhibitor CADA. Furthermore, to our knowledge, CADA is the first compound that specifically interferes with only a very small subset of SPs and does not affect signal anchor sequences.
PXD023337	34482371	Proteomic signatures of myeloid derived suppressor cells from liver and lung metastases reveal functional divergence and potential therapeutic targets. 	Proteomic Signatures of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells from Liver and Lung Metastases Reveal Functional Divergence and Potential Therapeutic Targets	Inflammation, Liver, Lung, MDSCs, Metastases, SWATH	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) promote immunosuppressive activities in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in increased tumor burden and diminishing the anti-tumor response of immunotherapies. While primary and metastatic tumors are typically the focal points of therapeutic development, the immune cells of the TME are differentially programmed by the tissue of the metastatic site. In particular, MDSCs are programmed uniquely within different organs in the context of tumor progression. Given that MDSC plasticity is shaped by the surrounding environment, the proteomes of MDSCs from different metastatic sites are hypothesized to be unique. A bottom-up proteomics approach using sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) was used to quantify the proteome of CD11b(+) cells derived from murine liver metastases (LM) and lung metastases (LuM). A comparative proteomics workflow was employed to compare MDSC proteins from LuM (LuM-MDSC) and LM (LM-MDSC) while also elucidating common signaling pathways, protein function, and possible drug-protein interactions. SWATH-MS identified 2516 proteins from 200 microg of sample. Of the 2516 proteins, 2367 have matching transcriptomic data. Upregulated proteins from lung and liver-derived murine CD11b(+) cells with matching mRNA transcriptomic data were categorized based on target knowledge and level of drug development. Comparative proteomic analysis demonstrates that liver and lung tumor-derived MDSCs have distinct proteomes that may be subject to pharmacologic manipulation.
PXD025185	34482629	Protease-sensitive regions in amyloid light chains: what a common pattern of fragmentation across organs suggests about aggregation. 	Protease-sensitive regions in amyloid light chains: what a common pattern of fragmentation across organs suggests about aggregation	Amyloid fibrils, Amyloidogenesis, Immunoglobulin Light chains, Proteolysis	Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is characterized by deposition of immunoglobulin light chains (LC) as fibrils in target organs. Alongside the full-length protein, abundant LC fragments are always present in AL deposits. Herein, by combining gel-based and mass spectrometry analyses, we identified and compared the fragmentation sites of amyloid LCs from multiple organs of an AL lambda amyloidosis patient (AL-55). The positions pinpointed here in kidney and subcutaneous fat, alongside those previously detected in heart of the same patient, were aligned and mapped on the LC's dimeric and fibrillar states. All tissues contain fragmented LCs along with the full-length protein; the fragment pattern is coincident across organs, although microheterogeneity exists. Multiple cleavage positions were detected; some are shared, whereas some are organ-specific, likely due to a complex of proteases. Cleavage sites are concentrated in 'proteolysis-prone' regions, common to all tissues. Several proteolytic sites are not accessible on native dimers, while they are compatible with fibrils. Overall, data suggest that the heterogeneous ensemble of LC fragments originates in tissues and is consistent with digestion of preformed fibrils, or with the hypothesis that initial proteolytic cleavage of the constant domain triggers the amyloidogenic potential of LCs, followed by subsequent proteolytic degradation. This work provides a unique set of molecular data on proteolysis from ex vivo amyloid, which allows discussing hypotheses on role and timing of proteolytic events occurring along amyloid formation and accumulation in AL patients.
PXD023296	34482820	Absolute quantitative proteomics using the total protein approach to identify novel clinical immunohistochemical markers in renal neoplasms. 	Renal cell carcinoma: a proteomic approach	Biomarkers, Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma, Clear cell renal cell carcinoma, Label-free quantification., Papillary renal cell carcinoma, Proteins, Renal Oncocytoma, Renal tumors	BACKGROUND: Renal neoplasms encompass a variety of malignant and benign tumors, including many with shared characteristics. The diagnosis of these renal neoplasms remains challenging with currently available tools. In this work, we demonstrate the total protein approach (TPA) based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) as a tool to improve the accuracy of renal neoplasm diagnosis. METHODS: Frozen tissue biopsies of human renal tissues [clear cell renal cell carcinoma (n = 7), papillary renal cell carcinoma (n = 5), chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (n = 5), and renal oncocytoma (n = 5)] were collected for proteome analysis. Normal adjacent renal tissue (NAT, n = 5) was used as a control. Proteins were extracted and digested using trypsin, and the digested proteomes were analyzed by label-free high-resolution MS (nanoLC-ESI-HR-MS/MS). Quantitative analysis was performed by comparison between protein abundances of tumors and NAT specimens, and the label-free and standard-free TPA was used to obtain absolute protein concentrations. RESULTS: A total of 205 differentially expressed proteins with the potential to distinguish the renal neoplasms were found. Of these proteins, a TPA-based panel of 24, including known and new biomarkers, was selected as the best candidates to differentiate the neoplasms. As proof of concept, the diagnostic potential of PLIN2, TUBB3, LAMP1, and HK1 was validated using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry with a total of 128 samples assessed on tissue micro-arrays. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of combining high-resolution MS and the TPA as potential new diagnostic tool in the pathology of renal neoplasms. A similar TPA approach may be implemented in any cancer study with solid biopsies.
PXD026315	34484111	Maternal Chronodisruption Throughout Pregnancy Impairs Glucose Homeostasis and Adipose Tissue Physiology in the Male Rat Offspring. 	Gestational chronodisruption throughout pregnancy impairs adipose tissue physiology in the offspring	LFQ mass süectrometry, adipose tissue physiology, chronodisruption	Compelling evidence in rats support the idea that gestational chronodisruption induces major changes in maternal circadian rhythms and fetal development and that these changes impact adult life at many physiological levels. Using a model of chronic photoperiod shifting throughout gestation (CPS), in which pregnant female rats (Sprague-Dawley strain; n = 16 per group) were exposed to lighting schedule manipulation every 3-4 days reversing the photoperiod completely or light/dark photoperiod (12/12; LD), we explored in the adult rat male offspring body weight gain, glucose homeostasis, adipose tissue content, adipose tissue response to norepinephrine (NE), and adipose tissue proteomic in the basal condition with standard diet (SD) and in response to high-fat diet (HFD). In adult CPS male (100-200 days old; n = 8 per group), we found increasing body weight, under SD and adiposity. Also, we found an increased response to intraperitoneal glucose (IGTT). After 12 weeks of HFD, white adipose tissue depots in CPS offspring were increased further, and higher IGTT and lower intraperitoneal insulin tolerance response were found, despite the lack of changes in food intake. In in vitro experiments, we observed that adipose tissue (WAT and BAT) glycerol response to NE from CPS offspring was decreased, and it was completely abolished by HFD. At the proteomic level, in CPS adipose tissue, 275 proteins displayed differential expression, compared with LD animals fed with a standard diet. Interestingly, CPS offspring and LD fed with HFD showed 20 proteins in common (2 upregulated and 18 downregulated). Based on these common proteins, the IPA analysis found that two functional pathways were significantly altered by CPS: network 1 (AKT/ERK) and network 2 (TNF/IL4; data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026315). The present data show that gestational chronodisruption induced deleterious effects in adipose tissue recruitment and function, supporting the idea that adipose tissue function was programmed in utero by gestational chronodisruption, inducing deficient metabolic responses that persist into adulthood.
PXD023898	34484135	YbfA Regulates the Sensitivity of Escherichia coli K12 to Plantaricin BM-1 via the BasS/BasR Two-Component Regulatory System. 	YbfA regulates the sensitivity of Escherichia coli K12 to plantaricin BM-1 via the BasS/BasR two-component regulatory system	Bacteriocins, BasS/BasR two-component, Biofilm, YbfA	Plantaricin BM-1, a class IIa bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum BM-1, shows obvious antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. However, the mechanism underlying the action of class IIa bacteriocins against gram-negative bacteria remains to be explored. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of YbfA, a DUF2517 domain-containing protein, in the response of Escherichia coli K12 to plantaricin BM-1. The growth curve experiment and MIC experiment showed that the sensitivity of E. coli to plantaricin BM-1 was decreased by a ybfA null mutation. Electron microscopy showed that the ybfA null mutation reduced the surface rupture and contraction caused by plantaricin BM-1, and mitigated the effect of plantaricin BM-1 on the morphology of the E. coli cell membrane. Proteomics analysis showed that 323 proteins were differentially expressed in E. coli lacking the ybfA gene (P < 0.05); 118 proteins were downregulated, and 205 proteins were upregulated. The metabolic pathways containing the upregulated proteins mainly included outer membrane proteins, integral components of the plasma membrane, regulation of cell motility, and regulation of locomotion. The metabolic pathways involving the downregulated proteins mainly included outer membrane protein glycine betaine transport, amino-acid betaine transport, and transmembrane signaling receptor activity. The results of the proteomics analysis showed that the protein expression of the BasS/BasR two-component system was significantly increased (P < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of downstream proteins regulated by this two-component system were also significantly increased, including DgkA, FliC, and MlaE, which are involved in cell membrane structure and function, and RT-qPCR also confirmed this result. The growth curve showed that the sensitivity of E. coli to plantaricin BM-1 was significantly increased due to deletion of the BasS/BasR two-component system. Thus, deletion of ybfA in E. coli can increase the expression of the BasS/BasR two-component system and positively regulate the structure and function of the cell membrane to reduce the sensitivity to plantaricin BM-1. This will help to explore the mechanism of action of class IIa bacteriocins against gram-negative bacteria.
PXD024098	34485169	Proteomic Analysis of Copper Toxicity in Human Fungal Pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. 	Cryptococcus neoformans LC-MS/MS	Cryptococcus neoformans	Cryptococcus neoformans is an invasive human fungal pathogen that causes more than 181,000 deaths each year. Studies have demonstrated that pulmonary C. neoformans infection induces innate immune responses involving copper, and copper detoxification in C. neoformans improves its fitness and pathogenicity during pulmonary C. neoformans infection. However, the molecular mechanism by which copper inhibits C. neoformans proliferation is unclear. We used a metallothionein double-knockout C. neoformans mutant that was highly sensitive to copper to demonstrate that exogenous copper ions inhibit fungal cell growth by inducing reactive oxygen species generation. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we found that copper down-regulated factors involved in protein translation, but up-regulated proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. We propose that the down-regulation of protein synthesis and the up-regulation of protein degradation are the main effects of copper toxicity. The ubiquitin modification of total protein and proteasome activity were promoted under copper stress, and inhibition of the proteasome pathway alleviated copper toxicity. Our proteomic analysis sheds new light on the antifungal mechanisms of copper.
PXD025967	34485242	Deciphering the O-Glycosylation of HKU1 Spike Protein With the Dual-Functional Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography Materials. 	Deciphering the O-glycosylation of HKU1 Spike Protein with the Dual-Functional Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography Materials	HKU1, O-glycosylation abundance, O-glycosylation sites, enrichment, spike glycoprotein	HKU1 is a human beta coronavirus and infects host cells via highly glycosylated spike protein (S). The N-glycosylation of HKU1 S has been reported. However, little is known about its O-glycosylation, which hinders the in-depth understanding of its biological functions. Herein, a comprehensive study of O-glycosylation of HKU1 S was carried out based on dual-functional histidine-bonded silica (HBS) materials. The enrichment method for O-glycopeptides with HBS was developed and validated using standard proteins. The application of the developed method to the HKU1 S1 subunit resulted in 46 novel O-glycosylation sites, among which 55.6% were predicted to be exposed on the outer protein surface. Moreover, the O-linked glycans and their abundance on each HKU1 S1 site were analyzed. The obtained O-glycosylation dataset will provide valuable insights into the structure of HKU1 S.
PXD027583	34486811	Alleviation of a polyglucosan storage disorder by enhancement of autophagic glycogen catabolism. 	Comparative proteomics of APBD and heathy control cells treated or not with 144DG11 under different conditions	144DG11, APBD, LC-MS, human skin fibroblasts	This work employs adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) models to explore the efficacy and mechanism of action of the polyglucosan-reducing compound 144DG11. APBD is a glycogen storage disorder (GSD) caused by glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) deficiency causing accumulation of poorly branched glycogen inclusions called polyglucosans. 144DG11 improved survival and motor parameters in a GBE knockin (Gbe(ys/ys) ) APBD mouse model. 144DG11 reduced polyglucosan and glycogen in brain, liver, heart, and peripheral nerve. Indirect calorimetry experiments revealed that 144DG11 increases carbohydrate burn at the expense of fat burn, suggesting metabolic mobilization of pathogenic polyglucosan. At the cellular level, 144DG11 increased glycolytic, mitochondrial, and total ATP production. The molecular target of 144DG11 is the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1, whose interaction with the compound, similar to LAMP1 knockdown, enhanced autolysosomal degradation of glycogen and lysosomal acidification. 144DG11 also enhanced mitochondrial activity and modulated lysosomal features as revealed by bioenergetic, image-based phenotyping and proteomics analyses. As an effective lysosomal targeting therapy in a GSD model, 144DG11 could be developed into a safe and efficacious glycogen and lysosomal storage disease therapy.
PXD021114	34487489	HspB8 prevents aberrant phase transitions of FUS by chaperoning its folded RNA-binding domain. 	HspB8 controls hardening and molecular aging of FUS condensates by domain-specific protein interactions Part 1	FUS, Hsp27, HspB8, Phase separation, molecular aging, qXL-MS	Aberrant liquid-to-solid phase transitions of biomolecular condensates have been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the underlying molecular interactions that drive aging remain enigmatic. Here, we develop quantitative time-resolved crosslinking mass spectrometry to monitor protein interactions and dynamics inside condensates formed by the protein fused in sarcoma (FUS). We identify misfolding of the RNA recognition motif of FUS as a key driver of condensate aging. We demonstrate that the small heat shock protein HspB8 partitions into FUS condensates via its intrinsically disordered domain and prevents condensate hardening via condensate-specific interactions that are mediated by its alpha-crystallin domain (alphaCD). These alphaCD-mediated interactions are altered in a disease-associated mutant of HspB8, which abrogates the ability of HspB8 to prevent condensate hardening. We propose that stabilizing aggregation-prone folded RNA-binding domains inside condensates by molecular chaperones may be a general mechanism to prevent aberrant phase transitions.
PXD022030	34489539	Nitrous oxide respiring bacteria in biogas digestates for reduced agricultural emissions. 	N2O-reducing population in anaerobic digestate for next-generation biorest	Anaerobic digestion, N2O-reduction, biorest	Inoculating agricultural soils with nitrous oxide respiring bacteria (NRB) can reduce N2O-emission, but would be impractical as a standalone operation. Here we demonstrate that digestates obtained after biogas production are suitable substrates and vectors for NRB. We show that indigenous NRB in digestates grew to high abundance during anaerobic enrichment under N2O. Gas-kinetics and meta-omic analyses showed that these NRB's, recovered as metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), grew by harvesting fermentation intermediates of the methanogenic consortium. Three NRB's were isolated, one of which matched the recovered MAG of a Dechloromonas, deemed by proteomics to be the dominant producer of N2O-reductase in the enrichment. While the isolates harbored genes required for a full denitrification pathway and could thus both produce and sequester N2O, their regulatory traits predicted that they act as N2O sinks in soil, which was confirmed experimentally. The isolates were grown by aerobic respiration in digestates, and fertilization with these NRB-enriched digestates reduced N2O emissions from soil. Our use of digestates for low-cost and large-scale inoculation with NRB in soil can be taken as a blueprint for future applications of this powerful instrument to engineer the soil microbiome, be it for enhancing plant growth, bioremediation, or any other desirable function.
PXD023027	34489947	Discovery of Novel Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Predicting the Progression of Multiple Sclerosis Using TMT-Based Quantitative Proteomics. 	Comparison of cerebrospinal fluid proteomics between Demyelinating disease and non-inflammatory neurological controls	Guillain-Barré Syndrome, calcium imbalance, cerebrospinal fluid, serum	Objective: Here, we aimed to identify protein biomarkers that could rapidly and accurately diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS) using a highly sensitive proteomic immunoassay. Methods: Tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to determine the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from 10 patients with MS and 10 non-inflammatory neurological controls (NINCs). The DEPs were analyzed using bioinformatics tools, and the candidate proteins were validated using the ELISA method in another cohort comprising 160 samples (paired CSF and plasma of 40 patients with MS, CSF of 40 NINCs, and plasma of 40 healthy individuals). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the diagnostic potential of this method. Results: Compared to NINCs, we identified 83 CSF-specific DEPs out of a total of 343 proteins in MS patients. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that these DEPs are mainly involved in platelet degranulation, negative regulation of proteolysis, and post-translational protein modification. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the complement and coagulation cascades, Ras signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway are the main components. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), and somatostatin (SST) were identified as the potential proteins with high scores, degree, and centrality in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. We validated the expression of these three proteins using ELISA. Compared to NINCs, the level of CSF IGFBP7 was significantly upregulated, and the level of CSF SST was significantly downregulated in the MS group. Conclusion: Our results suggest that SST and IGFBP7 might be associated with the pathogenesis of MS and would be helpful in diagnosing MS. Since IGFBP7 was used to classify relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) patients, therefore, it may act as a potential key marker and therapeutic target in MS.
PXD027694	34489952	Urine Proteomics Differentiate Primary Thrombotic Antiphospholipid Syndrome From Obstetric Antiphospholipid Syndrome. 	Urine proteomics in primary antiphospholipid syndrome	Urine proteomics, primary antiphospholipid syndrome	Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a multisystem disorder characterized by thrombosis and/or recurrent fetal loss. This clinical phenotype heterogeneity may result in differences in response to treatment and prognosis. In this study, we aimed to identify primary thrombotic APS (TAPS) from primary obstetric APS (OAPS) using urine proteomics as a non-invasive method. Only patients with primary APS were enrolled in this study from 2016 to 2018 at a single clinical center in Shanghai. Urine samples from 15 patients with TAPS, 9 patients with OAPS, and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were collected and analyzed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins. Cluster analysis of urine proteomics identified differentiated proteins among the TAPS, OAPS, and HC groups. Urinary proteins were enriched in cytokine and cytokine receptor pathways. Representative secreted cytokines screened out (fold change >1.20, or <0.83, p<0.05) in these differentiated proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a validation cohort. The results showed that the levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) were higher in the urine of patients with TAPS than in those with OAPS (p=0.035), while the levels of platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB) were lower in patients with TAPS than in those with OAPS (p=0.041). In addition, correlation analysis showed that CXCL12 levels were positively correlated with immunoglobulin G anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibody (r=0.617, p=0.016). Our results demonstrated that urinary CXCL12 and PDGFB might serve as potential non-invasive markers to differentiate primary TAPS from primary OAPS.
PXD027674	34490218	Protein Targets of Acetaminophen Covalent Binding in Rat and Mouse Liver Studied by LC-MS/MS. 	Protein Targets of Acetaminophen Covalent Binding in Rat and Mouse Liver Studied by LC-MS/MS	Acetaminophen, Covalent binding, NAPQI, liver, rat, reactive metabolite	Acetaminophen (APAP) is a mild analgesic and antipyretic used commonly worldwide. Although considered a safe and effective over-the-counter medication, it is also the leading cause of drug-induced acute liver failure. Its hepatotoxicity has been linked to the covalent binding of its reactive metabolite, N-acetyl p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), to proteins. The aim of this study was to identify APAP-protein targets in both rat and mouse liver, and to compare the results from both species, using bottom-up proteomics with data-dependent high resolution mass spectrometry and targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) experiments. Livers from rats and mice, treated with APAP, were homogenized and digested by trypsin. Digests were then fractionated by mixed-mode solid-phase extraction prior to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Targeted LC-MRM assays were optimized based on high-resolution MS/MS data from information-dependent acquisition (IDA) using control liver homogenates treated with a custom alkylating reagent yielding an isomeric modification to APAP on cysteine residues, to build a modified peptide database. A list of putative in vivo targets of APAP were screened from data-dependent high-resolution MS/MS analyses of liver digests, previous in vitro studies, as well as selected proteins from the target protein database (TPDB), an online resource compiling previous reports of APAP targets. Multiple protein targets in each species were found, while confirming modification sites. Several proteins were modified in both species, including ATP-citrate synthase, betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase 1, cytochrome P450 2C6/29, mitochondrial glutamine amidotransferase-like protein/ES1 protein homolog, glutamine synthetase, microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1, mitochondrial-processing peptidase, methanethiol oxidase, protein/nucleic acid deglycase DJ-1, triosephosphate isomerase and thioredoxin. The targeted method afforded better reproducibility for analysing these low-abundant modified peptides in highly complex samples compared to traditional data-dependent experiments.
PXD026705	34490328	Metaproteomic Insights Into the Microbial Community in Pozol. 	Bacterial metaproteome of a fermented maize dough	Pozol, metaproteome, traditional fermented food	Pozol is an acidic, refreshing, and non-alcoholic traditional Mayan beverage made with nixtamalized corn dough that is fermented spontaneously. The extensive analysis of the microbiology, biochemistry and metaproteomics of pozol allowed the construction of a comprehensive image of the fermentation system. The main changes in both the substrate and the microbiota occurred in the first 9 h of fermentation. The increase in microorganisms correlated with the drop in pH and with the decrease in the contents of carbohydrates, lipids, and nitrogen, which shows that this stage has the highest metabolic activity. Bacterial proteins were mainly represented by those of lactic acid bacteria, and among them, the proteins from genus Streptococcus was overwhelmingly the most abundant. Yeast proteins were present in all the analyzed samples, while proteins from filamentous fungi increased up to 48 h. The metaproteomic approach allowed us to identify several previously unknown enzyme complexes in the system. Additionally, enzymes for hydrolysis of starch, hemicellulose and cellulose were found, indicating that all these substrates can be used as a carbon source by the microbiota. Finally, enzymes related to the production of essential intermediates involved in the synthesis of organic acids, acetoin, butanediol, fatty acids and amino acids important for the generation of compounds that contribute to the sensorial quality of pozol, were found.
PXD024651	34491751	Alternative LC-MS/MS Platforms and Data Acquisition Strategies for Proteomic Genotyping of Human Hair Shafts. 	Alternative LC-MS/MS Platforms and Data Acquisition Strategies for Proteomic Genotyping	Forensic, Genetically Variant Peptide, Hair	Protein is a major component of all biological evidence. Proteomic genotyping is the use of genetically variant peptides (GVPs) that contain single-amino-acid polymorphisms to infer the genotype of matching nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms for the individual from whom the protein sample originated. This can be used to statistically associate an individual to evidence found at a crime scene. The utility of the inferred genotype increases as the detection of GVPs increases, which is the direct result of technology transfer to mass spectrometry platforms typically available. Digests of single (2 cm) human hair shafts from three European and two African subjects were analyzed using data-dependent acquisition on a Q-Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap system, data-independent acquisition and a variant of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid system, and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) on an Agilent 6495 triple quadrupole system. In our hands, average GVP detection from a selected panel of 24 GVPs increased from 6.5 +/- 1.1 and 3.1 +/- 0.8 using data-dependent and -independent acquisition to 9.5 +/- 0.7 and 11.7 +/- 1.7 using PRM and MRM (p < 0.05), respectively. PRM resulted in a 1.3-fold increase in detection sensitivity, and MRM resulted in a 1.6-fold increase in detection sensitivity. This increase in biomarker detection has a functional impact on the statistical association of a protein sample and an individual. Increased biomarker sensitivity, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling, produced a median-estimated random match probability of over 1 in 10 trillion from a single hair using targeted proteomics. For PRM and MRM, detected GVPs were validated by the inclusion of stable isotope-labeled peptides in each sample, which served also as a detection trigger. This research accomplishes two aims: the demonstration of utility for alternative analytical platforms in proteomic genotyping and the establishment of validation methods for the evaluation of inferred genotypes.
PXD027529	34491762	Kinase-Catalyzed Biotinylation to Map Cell Signaling Pathways: Application to Epidermal Growth Factor Signaling. 	Kinase-catalyzed Biotinylation to Map Cell Signaling Pathways (K-BMAPS): Application to Epidermal Growth Factor Signaling	ATP analog, ATP-biotin, cell signaling, interactome, kinase	Cell signaling involves a network of protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications that govern cellular responses to environmental cues. To understand and ultimately modulate these signaling pathways to confront disease, the complex web of proteins that becomes phosphorylated after extracellular stimulation has been studied using mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods. To complement prior work and fully characterize all phosphorylated proteins after the stimulation of cell signaling, we developed K-BMAPS (kinase-catalyzed biotinylation to map signaling), which utilizes ATP-biotin as a kinase cosubstrate to biotin label substrates. As a first application of the K-BMAPS method, the well-characterized epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase signaling pathway was monitored by treating epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated HeLa lysates with ATP-biotin, followed by streptavidin enrichment and quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. On the basis of the dynamic phosphoproteins identified, a pathway map was developed considering functional categories and known interactors of EGFR. Remarkably, 94% of the K-BMAPS hit proteins were included in the EGFR pathway map. With many proteins involved in transcription, translation, cell adhesion, and GTPase signaling, K-BMAPS identified phosphoproteins were associated with late and continuous signaling events. In summary, the K-BMAPS method is a powerful tool to map the dynamic phosphorylation governing cell signaling pathways.
PXD027308	34492159	GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of DEK3 regulates chromatin accessibility and stress tolerance in Arabidopsis. 	GSK3-Mediated Phosphorylation of DEK3 Regulates Chromatin Accessibility and Stress Tolerance in Arabidopsis	Chromatin / DEK / protein kinase / transcription / salt stress signalling	Chromatin dynamics enable the precise control of transcriptional programmes. The balance between restricting and opening of regulatory sequences on the DNA needs to be adjusted to prevailing conditions and is fine-tuned by chromatin remodelling proteins. DEK is an evolutionarily conserved chromatin architectural protein regulating important chromatin-related processes. However, the molecular link between DEK-induced chromatin reconfigurations and upstream signalling events remains unknown. Here, we show that ASKbeta/AtSK31 is a salt stress-activated glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) from Arabidopsis thaliana that phosphorylates DEK3. This specific phosphorylation alters nuclear DEK3 protein complex composition and affects nucleosome occupancy and chromatin accessibility that is translated into changes in gene expression, contributing to salt stress tolerance. These findings reveal that DEK3 phosphorylation is critical for chromatin function and cellular stress response and provide a mechanistic example of how GSK3-based signalling is directly linked to chromatin, facilitating a transcriptional response.

Anoxic growth is supported by endogenous redox metabolism, for which the thiol redox proteome serves as an interface. Here, we studied the cysteine (Cys) proteome dynamics of B. cereus ATCC 14579 cells grown under fermentative anoxic conditions. We used a quantitative thiol trapping method combined with proteomics profiling. RESULTS: In total, we identified 153 reactive Cys residues in 117 proteins participating in various cellular processes and metabolic pathways, including translation, carbohydrate metabolism, and stress response. Of these reactive Cys, 72 were detected as reduced Cys. The B. cereus Cys proteome evolved during growth both in terms of the number of reduced Cys and the Cys-containing proteins identified, reflecting its growth-phase-dependence. Interestingly, the reduced status of the B. cereus thiol proteome increased during growth, concomitantly to the decrease of extracellular oxidoreduction potential. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data show that the B. cereus Cys proteome during unstressed fermentative anaerobic growth is a dynamic entity and provide an important foundation for future redox proteomic studies in B. cereus and other organisms.
PXD024464	34493720	Proximity proteomics identifies PAK4 as a component of Afadin-Nectin junctions. 	Proximity proteomics identifies PAK4 as a component of Afadin-Nectin junctions.	BioID, Cdc42, LZTS2, PAK4, cell junctions, epithelial cells, protein kinase	Human PAK4 is an ubiquitously expressed p21-activated kinase which acts downstream of Cdc42. Since PAK4 is enriched in cell-cell junctions, we probed the local protein environment around the kinase with a view to understanding its location and substrates. We report that U2OS cells expressing PAK4-BirA-GFP identify a subset of 27 PAK4-proximal proteins that are primarily cell-cell junction components. Afadin/AF6 showed the highest relative biotin labelling and links to the nectin family of homophilic junctional proteins. Reciprocally >50% of the PAK4-proximal proteins were identified by Afadin BioID. Co-precipitation experiments failed to identify junctional proteins, emphasizing the advantage of the BioID method. Mechanistically PAK4 depended on Afadin for its junctional localization, which is similar to the situation in Drosophila. A highly ranked PAK4-proximal protein LZTS2 was immuno-localized with Afadin at cell-cell junctions. Though PAK4 and Cdc42 are junctional, BioID analysis did not yield conventional cadherins, indicating their spatial segregation. To identify cellular PAK4 substrates we then assessed rapid changes (12') in phospho-proteome after treatment with two PAK inhibitors. Among the PAK4-proximal junctional proteins seventeen PAK4 sites were identified. We anticipate mammalian group II PAKs are selective for the Afadin/nectin sub-compartment, with a demonstrably distinct localization from tight and cadherin junctions.
PXD024754	34495668	CIMAGE2.0: An Expanded Tool for Quantitative Analysis of Activity-Based Protein Profiling (ABPP) Data. 	CIMAGE2.0: An Expanded Tool for Quantitative Analysis of Activity-based Probe Profiling (ABPP) Data	ABPP, CIMAGE, Quantification	Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is a powerful chemical proteomic method for studying protein activity, modifications, and interactions in a high-throughput manner. In ABPP experiments, accurate quantification is crucial to determine the extent of probe labeling at the level of either target proteins or specific amino acid side chains. CIMAGE has been developed as an in-house quantification software specifically designed for ABPP data analysis that incorporates (1) a relaxed peak extraction algorithm and (2) stringent post-quantification checks for efficient and accurate quantification. It also can generate table and image data for users to conveniently visualize their results. Here we provide a retrospective introduction of the software and describe our recent upgrade efforts to enable (1) interfacing with different database search engines as input, (2) triplex quantification of ABPP data by reductive dimethylation, and (3) envelope checking for chemical elements with special isotopic distributions. We show that the updated CIMAGE can maintain its ability to quantify ABPP data with dramatic depth and high accuracy, and it also has similar quantification performance in benchmarked SILAC data as compared with MaxQuant. We believe that CIMAGE2.0 will continue to serve as a powerful analytical tool for ABPP studies.
PXD025378	34495684	Evidence for a nuclear role for Drosophila Dlg as a regulator of the NURF complex. 	Evidence for a Nuclear Role for Drosophila Dlg as a Regulator of the NURF Complex	NURF Complex	Scribble (Scrib), Discs-large (Dlg), and Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) are basolateral regulators of epithelial polarity and tumor suppressors whose molecular mechanisms of action remain unclear. We used proximity biotinylation to identify proteins localized near Dlg in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc epithelium. In addition to expected membrane- and cytoskeleton-associated protein classes, nuclear proteins were prevalent in the resulting mass spectrometry dataset, including all four members of the nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) chromatin remodeling complex. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated a nuclear pool of Dlg and proximity ligation confirmed its position near the NURF complex. Genetic analysis showed that NURF activity is also required for the overgrowth of dlg tumors, and this growth suppression correlated with a reduction in Hippo pathway gene expression. Together, these data suggest a nuclear role for Dlg in regulating chromatin and transcription through a more direct mechanism than previously thought.
PXD024607	34495765	Discovery of thymosin beta4 as a human exerkine and growth factor. 	Discovery of Thymosin beta-4 as a human exerkine and growth factor	contraction, exercise, growth factor, myokine, secreted factor	Skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ secreting exercise-induced factors (exerkines), which play a pivotal role in interorgan cross talk. Using mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, we characterized the secretome and identified thymosin beta4 (TMSB4X) as the most upregulated secreted protein in the media of contracting C2C12 myotubes. TMSB4X was also acutely increased in the plasma of exercising humans irrespective of the insulin resistance condition or exercise mode. Treatment of mice with TMSB4X did not ameliorate the metabolic disruptions associated with diet induced-obesity, nor did it enhance muscle regeneration in vivo. However, TMSB4X increased osteoblast proliferation and neurite outgrowth, consistent with its WADA classification as a prohibited growth factor. Therefore, we report TMSB4X as a human exerkine with a potential role in cellular cross talk.
PXD027703	34496567	Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Synovial Tissue Reveals That Upregulated OLFM4 Aggravates Inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis. 	Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-coupled LC-MS/MS in OA and RA patients synovial tissues	rheumatoid arthritis	Tandem mass tag (TMT)-coupled liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry is a powerful method to investigate synovial tissue protein profiles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Protein was isolated from synovial tissue samples of 22 patients and labeled with a TMT kit. Over 500 proteins were identified as the differential expression protein on comparing RA and OA synovial tissue, including 239 upregulated and 271 downregulated proteins. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027703. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the majority participated in the developmental processes and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4), a secreted glycoprotein, in joint inflammation of RA was explored. OLFM4 was upregulated in RA synovial tissue samples. In fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), inflammation cytokines, TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and LPS can upregulate OLFM4. After OLFM4 knockdown under TNF-alpha stimulation, RA FLS proliferation was inhibited and the expression of CXCL9, CXCL11, and MMP-1 was decreased. Overall, the RA synovial tissue protein expression profile by proteomic analysis shows some unique targets in RA pathophysiology, and OLFM4 in FLS plays an important role in RA joint inflammation. OLFM4 can be a promising therapeutic target in RA synovial tissue.
PXD027047	34496840	Construction of a la carte QconCAT protein standards for multiplexed quantification of user-specified target proteins. 	Synthetic biology meets proteomics: Construction of à la carte QconCATs for absolute protein quantification	ALACAT, Cell-free protein synthesis, QconCAT	BACKGROUND: QconCATs are quantitative concatamers for proteomic applications that yield stoichiometric quantities of sets of stable isotope-labelled internal standards. However, changing a QconCAT design, for example, to replace poorly performing peptide standards has been a protracted process. RESULTS: We report a new approach to the assembly and construction of QconCATs, based on synthetic biology precepts of biobricks, making use of loop assembly to construct larger entities from individual biobricks. The basic building block (a Qbrick) is a segment of DNA that encodes two or more quantification peptides for a single protein, readily held in a repository as a library resource. These Qbricks are then assembled in a one tube ligation reaction that enforces the order of assembly, to yield short QconCATs that are useable for small quantification products. However, the DNA context of the short construct also allows a second cycle of loop assembly such that five different short QconCATs can be assembled into a longer QconCAT in a second, single tube ligation. From a library of Qbricks, a bespoke QconCAT can be assembled quickly and efficiently in a form suitable for expression and labelling in vivo or in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: We refer to this approach as the ALACAT strategy as it permits a la carte design of quantification standards. ALACAT methodology is a major gain in flexibility of QconCAT implementation as it supports rapid editing and improvement of QconCATs and permits, for example, substitution of one peptide by another.
PXD022958	34497102	CSF Chitinase 3-Like 2 Is Associated With Long-term Disability Progression in Patients With Progressive Multiple Sclerosis. 	CSF chitinase 3-like 2 is associated with disability progression in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis	multiple sclerosis	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify long-term prognostic protein biomarkers associated with disease progression in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: CSF samples were collected from a discovery cohort of 28 patients with progressive MS who participated in a clinical trial with interferon beta. Patients were classified into high and low disability progression phenotypes according to numeric progression rates (NPR) and step-based progression rates (SPR) after a mean follow-up time of 12 years. Protein abundance was measured by shotgun proteomics. Selected proteins from the discovery cohort were quantified by parallel reaction monitoring in CSF samples from an independent validation cohort of 41 patients with progressive MS classified also into high and low disability progression phenotypes after a mean follow-up time of 7 years. RESULTS: Of 2,548 CSF proteins identified in the discovery cohort, 10 were selected for validation based on their association with long-term disability progression: SPATS2-like protein, chitinase 3-like 2 (CHI3L2), plasma serine protease inhibitor, metallothionein-3, phospholipase D4, beta-hexosaminidase, neurexophilin-1, adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1, cathepsin L1, and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein. Only CHI3L2 was validated, and patients with high disability progression exhibited significantly higher CSF protein levels compared with patients with low disability progression (p = 0.03 for NPR and p = 0.02 for SPR). CHI3L2 levels showed good performance to discriminate between high and low disability progression in patients with progressive MS (area under the curve 0.73; sensitivity 90% and specificity 63%). CONCLUSIONS: Although further confirmatory studies are needed, we propose CSF CHI3L2 as a prognostic protein biomarker associated with long-term disability progression in patients with progressive MS. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that high CSF CHI3L2 levels identified higher disability progression in patients with progressive MS.
PXD024917	34497125	Absolute quantification of tumor antigens using embedded MHC-I isotopologue calibrants. 	Absolute quantification of tumor antigens using embedded MHC-I isotopologue calibrants	MHC, SureQuant	Absolute quantification measurements (copies per cell) of peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) antigens are necessary to inform targeted immunotherapy drug design; however, existing methods for absolute quantification have critical limitations. Here, we present a platform termed SureQuant-IsoMHC, utilizing a series of pMHC isotopologues and internal standard-triggered targeted mass spectrometry to generate an embedded multipoint calibration curve to determine endogenous pMHC concentrations for a panel of 18 tumor antigens. We apply SureQuant-IsoMHC to measure changes in expression of our target panel in a melanoma cell line treated with a MEK inhibitor and translate this approach to estimate antigen concentrations in melanoma tumor biopsies.
PXD016064	34497420	Bioaccumulation of therapeutic drugs by human gut bacteria. 	Thermal proteome profiling in Clostridium saccharolyticum	Clostridium saccharolyticum, duloxetine, thermal proteome profiling	Bacteria in the gut can modulate the availability and efficacy of therapeutic drugs. However, the systematic mapping of the interactions between drugs and bacteria has only started recently(1) and the main underlying mechanism proposed is the chemical transformation of drugs by microorganisms (biotransformation). Here we investigated the depletion of 15 structurally diverse drugs by 25 representative strains of gut bacteria. This revealed 70 bacteria-drug interactions, 29 of which had not to our knowledge been reported before. Over half of the new interactions can be ascribed to bioaccumulation; that is, bacteria storing the drug intracellularly without chemically modifying it, and in most cases without the growth of the bacteria being affected. As a case in point, we studied the molecular basis of bioaccumulation of the widely used antidepressant duloxetine by using click chemistry, thermal proteome profiling and metabolomics. We find that duloxetine binds to several metabolic enzymes and changes the metabolite secretion of the respective bacteria. When tested in a defined microbial community of accumulators and non-accumulators, duloxetine markedly altered the composition of the community through metabolic cross-feeding. We further validated our findings in an animal model, showing that bioaccumulating bacteria attenuate the behavioural response of Caenorhabditis elegans to duloxetine. Together, our results show that bioaccumulation by gut bacteria may be a common mechanism that alters drug availability and bacterial metabolism, with implications for microbiota composition, pharmacokinetics, side effects and drug responses, probably in an individual manner.
PXD017164	34497906	Data-Independent-Acquisition-Based Proteomic Approach towards Understanding the Acclimation Strategy of Oleaginous Microalga Microchloropsis gaditana CCMP526 in Hypersaline Conditions. 	A Data-Independent-Acquisition-based proteomic approach towards understanding the acclimation strategy of Microchloropsis gaditana CCMP526 in hypersaline conditions	Microalgae, salinity, stress response	Salinity is one of the significant factors that affect growth and cellular metabolism, including photosynthesis and lipid accumulation, in microalgae and higher plants. Microchloropsis gaditana CCMP526 can acclimatize to different salinity levels by accumulating compatible solutes, carbohydrates, and lipids as energy storage molecules. We used proteomics to understand the molecular basis for acclimation of M. gaditana to increased salinity levels [55 and 100 PSU (practical salinity unit)]. Correspondence analysis was used for the identification of salinity-responsive proteins (SRPs). The highest number of salinity-induced proteins was observed in 100 PSU. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed a separate path of acclimation for cells exposed to 55 and 100 PSU. Osmolyte and lipid biosynthesis were upregulated in hypersaline conditions. Concomitantly, lipid oxidation pathways were also upregulated in hypersaline conditions, providing acetyl-CoA for energy metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Carbon fixation and photosynthesis were tightly regulated, while chlorophyll biosynthesis was affected in hypersaline conditions. Importantly, temporal proteome analysis of salinity-induced M. gaditana revealed vital SRPs which could be used for engineering salinity resilient microalgal strains for improved productivity in hypersaline culture conditions.
PXD026433	34499065	Crosslinking mass spectrometry unveils novel interactions and structural distinctions in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. 	Crosslinking mass spectrometry unveils novel interactions and structural distinctions in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii	Chlamydomonas, Crosslinking mass spectrometry, interactome, photosynthesis	Interactomics is an emerging field that seeks to identify both transient and complex-bound protein interactions that are essential for metabolic functions. Crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has enabled untargeted global analysis of these protein networks, permitting largescale simultaneous analysis of protein structure and interactions. Increased commercial availability of highly specific, cell permeable crosslinkers has propelled the study of these critical interactions forward, with the development of MS-cleavable crosslinkers further increasing confidence in identifications. Herein, the global interactome of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was analyzed via XL-MS by implementing the MS-cleavable disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO) crosslinker and enriching for crosslinks using strong cation exchange chromatography. Gentle lysis via repeated freeze-thaw cycles facilitated in vitro analysis of 157 protein-protein crosslinks (interlinks) and 612 peptides linked to peptides of the same protein (intralinks) at 1% FDR throughout the C. reinhardtii proteome. The interlinks confirmed known protein relationships across the cytosol and chloroplast, including coverage on 42% and 38% of the small and large ribosomal subunits, respectively. Of the 157 identified interlinks, 92% represent the first empirical evidence of interaction observed in C. reinhardtii. Several of these crosslinks point to novel associations between proteins, including the identification of a previously uncharacterized Mg-chelatase associated protein (Cre11.g477733.t1.2) bound to seven distinct lysines on Mg-chelatase (Cre06.g306300.t1.2). Additionally, the observed intralinks facilitated characterization of novel protein structures across the C. reinhardtii proteome. Together, these data establish a framework of protein-protein interactions that can be further explored to facilitate understanding of the dynamic protein landscape in C. reinhardtii.
PXD028071	34499924	Deamidation drives molecular aging of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding motif. 	Deamidation drives molecular aging of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding motif	ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, RBD, SARS-CoV-2, deamidation, molecular aging	The spike protein is the main protein component of the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface. The spike receptor-binding motif mediates recognition of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, a critical step in infection, and is the preferential target for spike-neutralizing antibodies. Posttranslational modifications of the spike receptor-binding motif have been shown to modulate viral infectivity and host immune response, but these modifications are still being explored. Here we studied asparagine deamidation of the spike protein, a spontaneous event that leads to the appearance of aspartic and isoaspartic residues, which affect both the protein backbone and its charge. We used computational prediction and biochemical experiments to identify five deamidation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Asparagine residues 481 and 501 in the receptor-binding motif deamidate with a half-life of 16.5 and 123 days at 37 degreesC, respectively. Deamidation is significantly slowed at 4 degreesC, indicating a strong dependence of spike protein molecular aging on environmental conditions. Deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif decreases the equilibrium constant for binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor more than 3.5-fold, yet its high conservation pattern suggests some positive effect on viral fitness. We propose a model for deamidation of the full SARS-CoV-2 virion illustrating how deamidation of the spike receptor-binding motif could lead to the accumulation on the virion surface of a nonnegligible chemically diverse spike population in a timescale of days. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for molecular aging of the spike protein with significant consequences for understanding virus infectivity and vaccine development.
PXD026942	34500763	Comparison of LFQ and IPTL for Protein Identification and Relative Quantification. 	Comparison of LFQ and IPTL for protein identification and relative quantification	IPTL, LFQ, SILAC, TMT, quantitative proteomics	(1) Background: Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteome profiling is most commonly performed by label-free quantification (LFQ), stable isotopic labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), and reporter ion-based isobaric labeling methods (TMT and iTRAQ). Isobaric peptide termini labeling (IPTL) was described as an alternative to these methods and is based on crosswise labeling of both peptide termini and MS2 quantification. High quantification accuracy was assumed for IPTL because multiple quantification points are obtained per identified MS2 spectrum. A direct comparison of IPTL with other quantification methods has not been performed yet because IPTL commonly requires digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C. (2) Methods: To enable tryptic digestion of IPTL samples, a novel labeling for IPTL was developed that combines metabolic labeling (Arg-0/Lys-0 and Arg-d4/Lys-d4, respectively) with crosswise N-terminal dimethylation (d4 and d0, respectively). (3) Results: The comparison of IPTL with LFQ revealed significantly more protein identifications for LFQ above homology ion scores but not above identity ion scores. (4) Conclusions: The quantification accuracy was superior for LFQ despite the many quantification points obtained with IPTL.
PXD028151	34502507	Regulation of the Golgi Apparatus by p38 and JNK Kinases during Cellular Stress Responses. 	Regulation of the Golgi apparatus by p38 and JNK kinases during cellular stress responses	Golgi, JNK, p38	p38 and c-Jun N-terninal kinase (JNK) are activated in response to acute stress and inflammatory signals. Through modification of a plethora of substrates, these kinases profoundly re-shape cellular physiology for the optimal response to a harmful environment and/or an inflammatory state. Here, we utilized phospho-proteomics to identify several hundred substrates for both kinases. Our results indicate that the scale of signaling from p38 and JNK are of a similar magnitude. Among the many new targets, we highlight the regulation of the transcriptional regulators grb10-interacting GYF protein 1 and 2 (GIGYF1/2) by p38-dependent MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. We also show that the Golgi apparatus contains numerous substrates, and is a major target for regulation by p38 and JNK. When activated, these kinases mediate structural rearrangement of the Golgi apparatus, which positively affects protein flux through the secretory system. Our work expands on our knowledge about p38 and JNK signaling with important biological ramifications.
PXD027878	34503159	Intra-Tumor Heterogeneity Revealed by Mass Spectrometry Imaging Is Associated with the Prognosis of Breast Cancer. 	Intra-tumor heterogeneity revealed by mass spectrometry im-aging is associated with the prognosis of breast cancer	HER2-positive breast cancer, intra-tumor heterogeneity, long-term outcome, mass spectrometry imaging, prognosis, tumor microenvironment	Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) results from the coexistence of genetically distinct cancer cell (sub)populations, their phenotypic plasticity, and the presence of heterotypic components of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here we addressed the potential association between phenotypic ITH revealed by mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and the prognosis of breast cancer. Tissue specimens resected from 59 patients treated radically due to the locally advanced HER2-positive invasive ductal carcinoma were included in the study. After the on-tissue trypsin digestion of cellular proteins, peptide maps of all cancer regions (about 380,000 spectra in total) were segmented by an unsupervised approach to reveal their intrinsic heterogeneity. A high degree of similarity between spectra was observed, which indicated the relative homogeneity of cancer regions. However, when the number and diversity of the detected clusters of spectra were analyzed, differences between patient groups were observed. It is noteworthy that a higher degree of heterogeneity was found in tumors from patients who remained disease-free during a 5-year follow-up (n = 38) compared to tumors from patients with progressive disease (distant metastases detected during the follow-up, n = 21). Interestingly, such differences were not observed between patients with a different status of regional lymph nodes, cancer grade, or expression of estrogen receptor at the time of the primary treatment. Subsequently, spectral components with different abundance in cancer regions were detected in patients with different outcomes, and their hypothetical identity was established by assignment to measured masses of tryptic peptides identified in corresponding tissue lysates. Such differentiating components were associated with proteins involved in immune regulation and hemostasis. Further, a positive correlation between the level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and heterogeneity revealed by MSI was observed. We postulate that a higher heterogeneity of tumors with a better prognosis could reflect the presence of heterotypic components including infiltrating immune cells, that facilitated the response to treatment.
PXD028107	34503228	Defining the Tumor Microenvironment by Integration of Immunohistochemistry and Extracellular Matrix Targeted Imaging Mass Spectrometry. 	Defining the Tumor Microenvironment by Integration of Im-munohistochemistry and Extracellular Matrix Targeted Imaging Mass Spectrometry	ECM, PTEN, breast cancer, imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), immunohistochemistry (IHC), stroma, tumor microenvironment	Breast stroma plays a significant role in breast cancer risk and progression yet remains poorly understood. In breast stroma, collagen is the most abundantly expressed protein and its increased deposition and alignment contributes to progression and poor prognosis. Collagen post-translation modifications such as hydroxylated-proline (HYP) control deposition and stromal organization. The clinical relevance of collagen HYP site modifications in cancer processes remains undefined due to technical issues accessing collagen from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. We previously developed a targeted approach for investigating collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins from FFPE tissue. Here, we hypothesized that immunohistochemistry staining for fibroblastic markers would not interfere with targeted detection of collagen stroma peptides and could reveal peptide regulation influenced by specific cell types. Our initial work demonstrated that stromal peptide peak intensities when using MALD-IMS following IHC staining (alphaSMA, FAP, P4HA3 and PTEN) were comparable to serial sections of nonstained tissue. Analysis of histology-directed IMS using PTEN on breast tissues and TMAs revealed heterogeneous PTEN staining patterns and suggestive roles in stromal protein regulation. This study sets the foundation for investigations of target cell types and their unique contribution to collagen regulation within extracellular matrix niches.
PXD025829	34504315	A proteome-wide atlas of lysine-reactive chemistry. 	A Proteome-Wide Atlas of Lysine-Reactive Chemistry	Human immune cells, lysine reactive probes	Recent advances in chemical proteomics have begun to characterize the reactivity and ligandability of lysines on a global scale. Yet, only a limited diversity of aminophilic electrophiles have been evaluated for interactions with the lysine proteome. Here, we report an in-depth profiling of >30 uncharted aminophilic chemotypes that greatly expands the content of ligandable lysines in human proteins. Aminophilic electrophiles showed disparate proteomic reactivities that range from selective interactions with a handful of lysines to, for a set of dicarboxaldehyde fragments, remarkably broad engagement of the covalent small-molecule-lysine interactions captured by the entire library. We used these latter 'scout' electrophiles to efficiently map ligandable lysines in primary human immune cells under stimulatory conditions. Finally, we show that aminophilic compounds perturb diverse biochemical functions through site-selective modification of lysines in proteins, including protein-RNA interactions implicated in innate immune responses. These findings support the broad potential of covalent chemistry for targeting functional lysines in the human proteome.
PXD026947	34504495	CD38 Deficiency Ameliorates Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease Murine Lupus via a B-Cell-Dependent Mechanism. 	Mouse spleen LC-MSMS from C57BL/6J WT, CD38-deficient and B6.C-H2bm12/KHEg (bm12) mice in cGVHD lupus-like model	CD38, GC B cells, T-bet+ B cells, anti-ssDNA autoantibodies, cGVHD	The absence of the mouse cell surface receptor CD38 in Cd38(-/-) mice suggests that this receptor acts as a positive regulator of inflammatory and autoimmune responses. Here, we report that, in the context of the chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) lupus inducible model, the transfer of B6.C-H2bm12/KhEg(bm12) spleen cells into co-isogenic Cd38(-/-) B6 mice causes milder lupus-like autoimmunity with lower levels of anti-ssDNA autoantibodies than the transfer of bm12 spleen cells into WT B6 mice. In addition, significantly lower percentages of Tfh cells, as well as GC B cells, plasma cells, and T-bet(+)CD11c(hi) B cells, were observed in Cd38(-/-) mice than in WT mice, while the expansion of Treg cells and Tfr cells was normal, suggesting that the ability of Cd38(-/-) B cells to respond to allogeneic help from bm12 CD4(+) T cells is greatly diminished. The frequencies of T-bet(+)CD11c(hi) B cells, which are considered the precursors of the autoantibody-secreting cells, correlate with anti-ssDNA autoantibody serum levels, IL-27, and sCD40L. Proteomics profiling of the spleens from WT cGVHD mice reflects a STAT1-driven type I IFN signature, which is absent in Cd38(-/-) cGVHD mice. Kidney, spleen, and liver inflammation was mild and resolved faster in Cd38(-/-) cGVHD mice than in WT cGVHD mice. We conclude that CD38 in B cells functions as a modulator receptor that controls autoimmune responses.
PXD022637	34506305	Signaling defects associated with insulin resistance in nondiabetic and diabetic individuals and modification by sex. 	Sex and Insulin Resistance Define a Cell Autonomous Supernetwork of Protein Phosphorylation	Diabetes, Insulin Resistance, Insulin Signaling, Phosphorylation, Sex	Insulin resistance is present in one-quarter of the general population, predisposing these people to a wide range of diseases. Our aim was to identify cell-intrinsic determinants of insulin resistance in this population using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC-derived) myoblasts (iMyos). We found that these cells exhibited a large network of altered protein phosphorylation in vitro. Integrating these data with data from type 2 diabetic iMyos revealed critical sites of conserved altered phosphorylation in IRS-1, AKT, mTOR, and TBC1D1 in addition to changes in protein phosphorylation involved in Rho/Rac signaling, chromatin organization, and RNA processing. There were also striking differences in the phosphoproteome in cells from men versus women. These sex-specific and insulin-resistance defects were linked to functional differences in downstream actions. Thus, there are cell-autonomous signaling alterations associated with insulin resistance within the general population and important differences between men and women, many of which also occur in diabetes, that contribute to differences in physiology and disease.
PXD023511	34508176	The long non-coding RNA SAMMSON is essential for uveal melanoma cell survival. 	ChIRP-MS of the lncRNA SAMMSON in uveal melanoma	ChIRP-MS, SAMMSON, lncRNA	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can exhibit cell-type and cancer-type specific expression profiles, making them highly attractive as therapeutic targets. Pan-cancer RNA sequencing data revealed broad expression of the SAMMSON lncRNA in uveal melanoma (UM), the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. Currently, there are no effective treatments for UM patients with metastatic disease, resulting in a median survival time of 6-12 months. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of SAMMSON inhibition in UM. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated SAMMSON inhibition impaired the growth and viability of a genetically diverse panel of uveal melanoma cell lines. These effects were accompanied by an induction of apoptosis and were recapitulated in two uveal melanoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) models through subcutaneous ASO delivery. SAMMSON pulldown revealed several candidate interaction partners, including various proteins involved in mitochondrial translation. Consequently, inhibition of SAMMSON impaired global, mitochondrial and cytosolic protein translation levels and mitochondrial function in uveal melanoma cells. The present study demonstrates that SAMMSON expression is essential for uveal melanoma cell survival. ASO-mediated silencing of SAMMSON may provide an effective treatment strategy to treat primary and metastatic uveal melanoma patients.
PXD025856	34509662	Quantitative proteomic analysis of glycosylated proteins enriched from urine samples with magnetic ConA nanoparticles identifies potential biomarkers for small cell lung cancer. 	Magnetic ConA nanoparticles enriched proteins from urine samples of healthy donors and lung cancer patients	Lung cancer, Magnetic ConA nanoparticles, Orbitrap Elite, Urine	Lung cancer has high morbidity and mortality and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly invasive malignant tumor with a very unfavorable survival rate. Early diagnosis and treatment can result in better prognosis for the SCLC patients but current diagnostic methods are either invasive or incapable for large-scale screen. Therefore, discovering biomarkers for early diagnosis of SCLC is of importance. In this work, we covalently coupled Concanavalin A (ConA) to functionalized magnetic nanoparticles to obtain magnetic ConA-nanoparticles (ConA-NPs) for the enrichment of glycosylated proteins. We then purified glycosylated proteins in 36 urine samples from 9 healthy controls, 9 SCLC patients, 9 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients, and 9 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients. The purified glycosylated proteins were digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS for identification and quantification. Among the 398 identified proteins, 20, 15, and 1 glycosylated protein(s), respectively, were upregulated in the urine of SCLC, LUAD, and LUSC patients. Immunoblotting experiments further demonstrated that cathepsin C and transferrin were significantly upregulated in the ConA-NP purified urine of SCLC patients. This work suggests that glycosylated cathepsin C and transferrin might be able to serve as potential biomarkers for the noninvasive diagnosis of SCLC patients.
PXD027893	34510746	Proteomic study of apheresis platelets made HLA class I deficient for transfusion of refractory patients. 	Proteomic study of apheresis platelets made HLA class I deficient for transfusion of refractory patients	HLA class I, Platelets, beta-2 microglobulin	PURPOSE: Refractoriness can occur after repeated platelet (PLT) transfusions because of alloimmunization to HLA class I antigens on transfused PLTs and generation of anti-HLA antibodies that bind to the foreign PLTs and initiate their destruction. Such refractoriness can be overcome by provision of HLA-matched PLTs from HLA typed donors. However, since the procedure is both expensive and time-consuming, an alternative approach is to deplete PLTs of HLA class I molecules by a brief treatment with citric acid, on ice. This is shown to be feasible without damaging PLT function. We used label free quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to investigate the effect of acid treatment on apheresis PLTs for combatting immunologic PLT refractoriness. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Proteomic analyses are undertaken using PLTs from seven apheresis concentrates, which were split in two with or without acid treatment. RESULTS: In total 1717 proteins in apheresis PLTs were quantified using proteomics. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027893 . Of these, the amount of 80 proteins changed significantly after acid treatment, but overall there were not any major differences in proteomes between samples with and without acid treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In general, the changes of PLT proteins after treatment with citric acid were quite small and functionally safe. Hence, this result taken together with our previously published data indicates that acid treated PLTs can be used for treatment of patients with PLT refractoriness and opens up for a clinical trial.
PXD027561	34512304	Discovery of Novel Markers for Identifying Cognitive Decline Using Neuron-Derived Exosomes. 	Discovery of novel markers for identifying cognitive decline from neuron-derived exosomes	MCI, Neuron derived exosome	Alzheimer's disease (AD), the predominant cause of late-life dementia, has a multifactorial etiology. Since there are few therapeutic options for symptomatic AD, research is increasingly focused on the identification of pre-symptomatic biomarkers. Recently, evaluation of neuron-derived exosomal markers has emerged as a promising novel approach for determining neuronal dysfunction. We aimed to identify novel neuron-derived exosomal markers that signify a transition from normal aging to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and then to clinically established AD, a sequence we refer to as AD progression. By using a Tandem Mass Tag-based quantitative proteomic approach, we identified a total of 360 neuron-derived exosomal proteins. Subsequent fuzzy c-means clustering revealed two clusters of proteins displaying trends of gradually increasing/decreasing expression over the period of AD progression (normal to MCI to AD), both of which were mainly involved in immune response-associated pathways, proteins within these clusters were defined as bridge proteins. Several differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the progression of AD. The intersections of bridge proteins and DEPs were defined as key proteins, including C7 (Complement component 7), FERMT3 (Fermitin Family Member 3), CAP1 (Adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1), ENO1 (Enolase 1), and ZYX (Zyxin), among which the expression patterns of C7 and ZYX were almost consistent with the proteomic results. Collectively, we propose that C7 and ZYX might be two novel neuron-derived exosomal protein markers, expression of which might be used to evaluate cognitive decline before a clinical diagnosis of AD is warranted.
PXD025118	34512594	Dietary Supplementation With Creatine Pyruvate Alters Rumen Microbiota Protein Function in Heat-Stressed Beef Cattle. 	bacterial protein function in rumen of heat-stressed beef cattle	beef cattle, creatine pyruvate, heat stress, metaproteomics	Creatine pyruvate (CrPyr) is a new multifunctional nutrient that can provide both pyruvate and creatine. It has been shown to relieve the heat stress of beef cattle by improving antioxidant activity and rumen microbial protein synthesis, but the mechanism of CrPyr influencing rumen fermentation remains unclear. This study aimed to combine 16S rDNA sequencing and metaproteomics technologies to investigate the microbial composition and function in rumen fluid samples taken from heat-stressed beef cattle treated with or without 60 g/day CrPyr. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that there were no significant differences in the alpha-diversity indices between the two groups. By analyzing the level profiles of 700 distinct proteins, we found that the CrPyr administration increased the expression of enzymes involved in specific metabolic pathways including (i) fatty acid beta-oxidation; (ii) interconversion from pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate, oxaloacetate, acetyl-CoA, and malate; (iii) glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and citrate cycle metabolism; and (iv) biosynthesis of amino acids. These results indicated that the increased generation of adenosine triphosphate during fatty acid beta-oxidation or citrate cycle and the up-regulation synthesis of microbial protein in rumen of beef cattle treated with CrPyr may help decrease oxidative stress, regulate energy metabolism, and further improve the rumen fermentation characteristic under heat stress.
PXD021024	34512705	Comprehensive Proteome and Lysine Acetylome Analysis Reveals the Widespread Involvement of Acetylation in Cold Resistance of Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). 	Comprehensive Proteome and Lysine Acetylome Analysis Reveals the Widespread Involvement of Acetylation in Cold Resistant of Peppers (Capsicum annuum L.)	Pepper, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, cold stress, lysine acetylation, photosynthesis, recovery	Pepper is a typical warmth-loving vegetable that lacks a cold acclimation mechanism and is sensitive to cold stress. Lysine acetylation plays an important role in diverse cellular processes, but limited knowledge is available regarding acetylation modifications in the resistance of pepper plants to cold stress. In this study, the proteome and acetylome of two pepper varieties with different levels of cold resistance were investigated by subjecting them to cold treatments of varying durations followed by recovery periods. In total, 6,213 proteins and 4,574 lysine acetylation sites were identified, and this resulted in the discovery of 3,008 differentially expressed proteins and 768 differentially expressed acetylated proteins. A total of 1,988 proteins were identified in both the proteome and acetylome, and the functional differences in these co-identified proteins were elucidated through GO enrichment. KEGG analysis showed that 397 identified acetylated proteins were involved in 93 different metabolic pathways. The dynamic changes in the acetylated proteins in photosynthesis and the "carbon fixation in the photosynthetic organisms" pathway in pepper under low-temperature stress were further analyzed. It was found that acetylation of the PsbO and PsbR proteins in photosystem II and the PsaN protein in photosystem I could regulate the response of pepper leaves to cold stress. The acetylation levels of key carbon assimilation enzymes, such as ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoribulokinase, and triosephosphate isomerase decreased, leading to decreases in carbon assimilation capacity and photosynthetic efficiency, reducing the cold tolerance of pepper leaves. This study is the first to identify the acetylome in pepper, and it greatly expands the catalog of lysine acetylation substrates and sites in Solanaceae crops, providing new insights for posttranslational modification studies.
PXD025134	34513734	An Innovative Protocol for Metaproteomic Analyses of Microbial Pathogens in Cystic Fibrosis Sputum. 	A combined metaproteomics and metabolomics approach for the in vivo analysis of cystic fibrosis sputum focusing on microbial pathogens	16S sequencing, Cystic fibrosis, in vivo, metabolomics, metaproteomics, microbial community, microbiome, sputum	Hallmarks of cystic fibrosis (CF) are increased viscosity of mucus and impaired mucociliary clearance within the airways due to mutations of the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator gene. This facilitates the colonization of the lung by microbial pathogens and the concomitant establishment of chronic infections leading to tissue damage, reduced lung function, and decreased life expectancy. Although the interplay between key CF pathogens plays a major role during disease progression, the pathophysiology of the microbial community in CF lungs remains poorly understood. Particular challenges in the analysis of the microbial population present in CF sputum is (I) the inhomogeneous, viscous, and slimy consistence of CF sputum, and (II) the high number of human proteins masking comparably low abundant microbial proteins. To address these challenges, we used 21 CF sputum samples to develop a reliable, reproducible and widely applicable protocol for sputum processing, microbial enrichment, cell disruption, protein extraction and subsequent metaproteomic analyses. As a proof of concept, we selected three sputum samples for detailed metaproteome analyses and complemented and validated metaproteome data by 16S sequencing, metabolomic as well as microscopic analyses. Applying our protocol, the number of bacterial proteins/protein groups increased from 199-425 to 392-868 in enriched samples compared to nonenriched controls. These early microbial metaproteome data suggest that the arginine deiminase pathway and multiple proteases and peptidases identified from various bacterial genera could so far be underappreciated in their contribution to the CF pathophysiology. By providing a standardized and effective protocol for sputum processing and microbial enrichment, our study represents an important basis for future studies investigating the physiology of microbial pathogens in CF in vivo - an important prerequisite for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies to combat chronic recurrent airway infection in CF.
PXD026980	34514546	Altered ceramide metabolism is a feature in the extracellular vesicle-mediated spread of alpha-synuclein in Lewy body disorders. 	Altered ceramide metabolism is a feature in the extracellular vesicle mediated spread of alpha-synuclein in sporadic and GBA-linked Lewy body disease	Lewy body disease, alpha-synuclein, ceramide, exosomes, extracellular vesicles, glucocerebrosidase, inflammation	Mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GBA) are the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Lewy body disorders (LBD)-collectively Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. Despite this genetic association, it remains unclear how GBA mutations increase susceptibility to develop LBD. We investigated relationships between LBD-specific glucocerebrosidase deficits, GBA-related pathways, and alpha-synuclein levels in brain tissue from LBD and controls, with and without GBA mutations. We show that LBD is characterised by altered sphingolipid metabolism with prominent elevation of ceramide species, regardless of GBA mutations. Since extracellular vesicles (EV) could be involved in LBD pathogenesis by spreading disease-linked lipids and proteins, we investigated EV derived from post-mortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue from GBA mutation carriers and non-carriers. EV purified from LBD CSF and frontal cortex were heavily loaded with ceramides and neurodegeneration-linked proteins including alpha-synuclein and tau. Our in vitro studies demonstrate that LBD EV constitute a "pathological package" capable of inducing aggregation of wild-type alpha-synuclein, mediated through a combination of alpha-synuclein-ceramide interaction and the presence of pathological forms of alpha-synuclein. Together, our findings indicate that abnormalities in ceramide metabolism are a feature of LBD, constituting a promising source of biomarkers, and that GBA mutations likely accelerate the pathological process occurring in sporadic LBD through endolysosomal deficiency.
PXD026034	34514732	Establishment of a simplified dichotomic size-exclusion chromatography for isolating extracellular vesicles toward clinical applications. 	dichotomic size-exclusion chromatography(SEC)	SEC, ultracentifugation(UC)	Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) is a widely adopted method for the isolation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from complex samples. SEC can efficiently remove high-abundant proteins, while often requires multiple fractionation operation using diversified column settings. In this study, we aim to establish a simplified SEC method to acquire high quality EVs. In comparison of all three cross-linked Sepharose resins with the sample types of FBS and human serum (HS), CL-6B and CL-4B showed superior performance in regular SEC to CL-2B in terms of significantly narrower EV and protein peaks, higher resolutions and EV purity. By increasing their bed volumes to 20 ml, the resolutions of CL-6B and CL-4B columns could be significantly improved, while the CL-6B column had the best performance with higher particle yields and tighter EV peaks. With the CL-6B 20 ml column, we further established a simplified dichotomic SEC method that only requires two bulk elutions to acquire EVs in the Eluate 1 and proteins in the Eluate 2. We further justified that such CL-6B columns were reusable for at least 10 consecutive times, and the dichotomic SEC was applicable to EV isolations from HS and FBS-free supernatants of fluorescently labelled and unlabelled SW620 cells. The proteomics analysis implicated that although the two methods had dissimilar abilities in removing different co-isolating contaminant proteins from EVs, the dichotomic SEC and ultracentrifugation could isolate EVs from human plasma with comparable purity. This dichotomic SEC has its intriguing potential to be used for EV preparation toward clinical testing and/or basic research.
PXD020690	34515295	Stepwise oxidations play key roles in the structural and functional regulations of DJ-1. 	PTM and HDX-MS analysis of DJ-1	DJ-1, HDX-MS, oxidation	DJ-1 is known to play neuroprotective roles by eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as an antioxidant protein. However, the molecular mechanism of DJ-1 function has not been well elucidated. This study explored the structural and functional changes of DJ-1 in response to oxidative stress. Human DJ-1 has three cysteine residues (Cys46, Cys53 and Cys106). We found that, in addition to Cys106, Cys46 is the most reactive cysteine residue in DJ-1, which was identified employing an NPSB-B chemical probe (Ctag) that selectively reacts with redox-sensitive cysteine sulfhydryl. Peroxidatic Cys46 readily formed an intra-disulfide bond with adjacent resolving Cys53, which was identified with nanoUPLC-ESI-q-TOF tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) employing DBond algorithm under the non-reducing condition. Mutants (C46A and C53A), not forming Cys46-Cys53 disulfide cross-linking, increased oxidation of Cys106 to sulfinic and sulfonic acids. Furthermore, we found that DJ-1 C46A mutant has distorted unstable structure identified by biochemical assay and employing hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) analysis. All three Cys mutants lost antioxidant activities in SN4741 cell, a dopaminergic neuronal cell, unlike WT DJ-1. These findings suggest that all three Cys residues including Cys46-Cys53 disulfide cross-linking are required for maintaining the structural integrity, the regulation process and cellular function as an antioxidant protein. These studies broaden the understanding of regulatory mechanisms of DJ-1 that operate under oxidative conditions.
PXD023877	34515472	Enhancement of Tryptic Peptide Signals from Tissue Sections Using MALDI IMS Postionization (MALDI-2). 	Enhancement of Tryptic Peptide Signals from Tissue Sections using MALDI IMS Post-ionization (MALDI-2)	MALDI-2, imaging mass spectrometry, kidney	Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) allows for highly multiplexed, unlabeled mapping of analytes from tissue sections. However, further work is needed to improve the sensitivity and depth of coverage for protein and peptide IMS. We demonstrate signal enhancement of proteolytic peptides from thin tissue sections of human kidney by conventional MALDI (MALDI-1) augmented using a second ionizing laser (termed MALDI-2). Proteins were digested in situ using trypsin prior to IMS analysis. For tentative identification of peptides and proteins, a tissue homogenate from the same organ used for IMS was analyzed by LC-MS/MS, and data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD023877. These identified proteins were then digested in silico to generate a database of theoretical peptides to then match to MALDI IMS data sets. Peptides were tentatively identified by matching the MALDI peak list to the database peptide list based on mass accuracy (5 ppm mass error). This resulted in 1337 +/- 96 (n = 3) peptides and 2076 +/- 362 (n = 3) unique peptides matched to IMS peaks from MALDI-1 and MALDI-2, respectively. Protein identifications requiring two or more peptides per protein resulted in 276 +/- 20 proteins with MALDI-1 and 401 +/- 60 with MALDI-2. These results demonstrate that MALDI-2 provides enhanced sensitivity for the spatial mapping of tryptic peptides and significantly increases the number of proteins identified in IMS experiments.
PXD013978	34516824	Temporal multi-omics identifies LRG1 as a vascular niche instructor of metastasis. 	Temporal multi-omics identifies LRG1 as vascular instructor of early metastatic colonization.	Cancer, LRG1, Metastasis, and Vascular niche, endothelial cells	Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality. Tumor cell interactions with cells of the vessel wall are decisive and potentially rate-limiting for metastasis. The molecular nature of this cross-talk is, beyond candidate gene approaches, hitherto poorly understood. Using endothelial cell (EC) bulk and single-cell transcriptomics in combination with serum proteomics, we traced the evolution of the metastatic vascular niche in surgical models of lung metastasis. Temporal multiomics revealed that primary tumors systemically reprogram the body's vascular endothelium to perturb homeostasis and to precondition the vascular niche for metastatic growth. The vasculature with its enormous surface thereby serves as amplifier of tumor-induced instructive signals. Comparative analysis of lung EC gene expression and secretome identified the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) pathway specifier LRG1, leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, as an early instructor of metastasis. In the presence of a primary tumor, ECs systemically up-regulated LRG1 in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent manner. A meta-analysis of retrospective clinical studies revealed a corresponding up-regulation of LRG1 concentrations in the serum of patients with cancer. Functionally, systemic up-regulation of LRG1 promoted metastasis in mice by increasing the number of prometastatic neural/glial antigen 2 (NG2)(+) perivascular cells. In turn, genetic deletion of Lrg1 hampered growth of lung metastasis. Postsurgical adjuvant administration of an LRG1-neutralizing antibody delayed metastatic growth and increased overall survival. This study has established a systems map of early primary tumor-induced vascular changes and identified LRG1 as a therapeutic target for metastasis.
PXD021357	34518519	Sirtuin 3 regulates mitochondrial protein acetylation and metabolism in tubular epithelial cells during renal fibrosis. 	Sirtuin 3 regulates mitochondrial protein acetylation and metabolism in tubular epithelial cells during renal fibrosis	kidney, tubules	Proximal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) demand high energy and rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as the main energy source. However, this is disturbed in renal fibrosis. Acetylation is an important post-translational modification for mitochondrial metabolism. The mitochondrial protein NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) regulates mitochondrial metabolic function. Therefore, we aimed to identify the changes in the acetylome in tubules from fibrotic kidneys and determine their association with mitochondria. We found that decreased SIRT3 expression was accompanied by increased acetylation in mitochondria that have separated from TECs during the early phase of renal fibrosis. Sirt3 knockout mice were susceptible to hyper-acetylated mitochondrial proteins and to severe renal fibrosis. The activation of SIRT3 by honokiol ameliorated acetylation and prevented renal fibrosis. Analysis of the acetylome in separated tubules using LC-MS/MS showed that most kidney proteins were hyper-acetylated after unilateral ureteral obstruction. The increased acetylated proteins with 26.76% were mitochondrial proteins which were mapped to a broad range of mitochondrial pathways including fatty acid beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1alpha (PDHE1alpha), which is the primary link between glycolysis and the TCA cycle, was hyper-acetylated at lysine 385 in TECs after TGF-beta1 stimulation and was regulated by SIRT3. Our findings showed that mitochondrial proteins involved in regulating energy metabolism were acetylated and targeted by SIRT3 in TECs. The deacetylation of PDHE1alpha by SIRT3 at lysine 385 plays a key role in metabolic reprogramming associated with renal fibrosis.
PXD020230	34518524	LPCAT1 reprogramming cholesterol metabolism promotes the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. 	Proteomics of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	carcinoma, esophageal, squamous cell	Tumor cells require high levels of cholesterol for membrane biogenesis for rapid proliferation during development. Beyond the acquired cholesterol from low-density lipoprotein (LDL) taken up from circulation, tumor cells can also biosynthesize cholesterol. The molecular mechanism underlying cholesterol anabolism in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and its effect on patient prognosis are unclear. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is common in cancer. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) has been implicated in various cancer types; however, its role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear. In this study, we identified that LPCAT1 is highly expressed in ESCC and that LPCAT1 reprograms cholesterol metabolism in ESCC. LPCAT1 expression was negatively correlated with patient prognosis. Cholesterol synthesis in ESCC cells was significantly inhibited following LPCAT1 knockdown; cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were significantly reduced, along with the growth of xenograft subcutaneous tumors. LPCAT1 could regulate the expression of the cholesterol synthesis enzyme, SQLE, by promoting the activation of PI3K, thereby regulating the entry of SP1/SREBPF2 into the nucleus. LPCAT1 also activates EGFR leading to the downregulation of INSIG-1 expression, facilitating the entry of SREBP-1 into the nucleus to promote cholesterol synthesis. Taken together, LPCAT1 reprograms tumor cell cholesterol metabolism in ESCC and can be used as a potential treatment target against ESCC.
PXD021722	34518544	Hypoxia regulates overall mRNA homeostasis by inducing Met(1)-linked linear ubiquitination of AGO2 in cancer cells. 	Hypoxia Regulates Overall mRNA Homeostasis by Inducing Met1-linked Linear Ubiquitination of AGO2 in Cancer Cells	AGO2, Global mRNA homeostasis, Hypoxia, Met1-linked linear ubiquitination, mRNA decay, miRISC	Hypoxia is the most prominent feature in human solid tumors and induces activation of hypoxia-inducible factors and their downstream genes to promote cancer progression. However, whether and how hypoxia regulates overall mRNA homeostasis is unclear. Here we show that hypoxia inhibits global-mRNA decay in cancer cells. Mechanistically, hypoxia induces the interaction of AGO2 with LUBAC, the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, which co-localizes with miRNA-induced silencing complex and in turn catalyzes AGO2 occurring Met(1)-linked linear ubiquitination (M1-Ubi). A series of biochemical experiments reveal that M1-Ubi of AGO2 restrains miRNA-mediated gene silencing. Moreover, combination analyses of the AGO2-associated mRNA transcriptome by RIP-Seq and the mRNA transcriptome by RNA-Seq confirm that AGO2 M1-Ubi interferes miRNA-targeted mRNA recruiting to AGO2, and thereby facilitates accumulation of global mRNAs. By this mechanism, short-term hypoxia may protect overall mRNAs and enhances stress tolerance, whereas long-term hypoxia in tumor cells results in seriously changing the entire gene expression profile to drive cell malignant evolution.
PXD026975	34518572	Paraquat-induced cholesterol biosynthesis proteins dysregulation in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. 	Proteomics analysis unraveled paraquat-induced cholesterol biosynthesis dysregulation in human brain microvascular endothelial cells	DIA, Paraquat, brain endothelial cells, cholesterol, mitochondria	Despite Paraquat (PQ) being banned in several countries, it is still one of the most commonly used herbicides in agriculture. This compound is known to induce damaging effects on human and animal brain cells by generating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). However, there is few evidence of PQ effect on Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HBMECs), one of the major component of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB). The present study aimed at unraveling biological mechanisms associated to the exposure of 1, 10 and 100 microM of PQ for 24 h on HBMECs. High-throughput mass spectrometry-based proteomics using data-independent acquisition (DIA) was applied. Biological pathway enrichment and cellular assays such as mitochondrial respiration and cholesterol level were performed to verify proteomics results. A total of 3753 proteins were quantified out of which 419 were significantly modulated by paraquat exposure. Biological pathway enrichment revealed the ubiquinone metabolism, a pathway directly linked to mitochondrial complex I proteins, confirming the well-known mechanism of PQ inducing oxidative stress. Additionally, this study also described the cholesterol biosynthesis modulation on HBMECs not yet described. In conclusion, our data indicate the toxic effect of PQ on HBMECs by downregulating proteins involved in mitochondrial complex I and cholesterol pathways.
PXD027295	34518698	De novo design of tyrosine and serine kinase-driven protein switches. 	De Novo Design of Tyrosine and Serine Kinase Driven Protein Switches	designed proteins, kinase, switch	Kinases play central roles in signaling cascades, relaying information from the outside to the inside of mammalian cells. De novo designed protein switches capable of interfacing with tyrosine kinase signaling pathways would open new avenues for controlling cellular behavior, but, so far, no such systems have been described. Here we describe the de novo design of two classes of protein switch that link phosphorylation by tyrosine and serine kinases to protein-protein association. In the first class, protein-protein association is required for phosphorylation by the kinase, while in the second class, kinase activity drives protein-protein association. We design systems that couple protein binding to kinase activity on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif central to T-cell signaling, and kinase activity to reconstitution of green fluorescent protein fluorescence from fragments and the inhibition of the protease calpain. The designed switches are reversible and function in vitro and in cells with up to 40-fold activation of switching by phosphorylation.
PXD027992	34519218	Nanodisc-Based Proteomics Identify Caj1 as an Hsp40 with Affinity for Phosphatidic Acid Lipids. 	Nanodiscs-based proteomics to identify lipid-interacting proteins in yeast	Caj1, Hsp40, Nanodiscs, Rab GTPase, SILAC labeling	Many soluble proteins interact with membranes to perform important biological functions, including signal transduction, regulation, transport, trafficking, and biogenesis. Despite their importance, these protein-membrane interactions are difficult to characterize due to their often-transient nature as well as phospholipids' poor solubility in aqueous solution. Here, we employ nanodiscs-small, water-soluble patches of a lipid bilayer encircled with amphipathic scaffold proteins-along with quantitative proteomics to identify lipid-binding proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using nanodiscs reconstituted with yeast total lipid extracts or only phosphatidylethanolamine (PE-nanodiscs), we capture several known membrane-interacting proteins, including the Rab GTPases Sec4 and Ypt1, which play key roles in vesicle trafficking. Utilizing PE-nanodiscs enriched with phosphatidic acid (PEPA-nanodiscs), we specifically capture a member of the Hsp40/J-protein family, Caj1, whose function has recently been linked to membrane protein quality control. We show that the Caj1 interaction with liposomes containing PA is modulated by pH and PE lipids and depends on two patches of positively charged residues near the C-terminus of the protein. The protein Caj1 is the first example of an Hsp40/J-domain protein with affinity for membranes and phosphatidic acid lipid specificity. These findings highlight the utility of combining proteomics with lipid nanodiscs to identify and characterize protein-lipid interactions that may not be evident using other methods. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD027992.
PXD027338	34519498	Combined Metabolic and Chemical (CoMetChem) Labeling Using Stable Isotopes-a Strategy to Reveal Site-Specific Histone Acetylation and Deacetylation Rates by LC-MS. 	Combined Metabolic and Chemical (CoMetChem) labeling using stable isotopes	acetylation, histones, stable isotopes	Histone acetylation is an important, reversible post-translational protein modification and a hallmark of epigenetic regulation. However, little is known about the dynamics of this process, due to the lack of analytical methods that can capture site-specific acetylation and deacetylation reactions. We present a new approach that combines metabolic and chemical labeling (CoMetChem) using uniformly 13C-labeled glucose and stable isotope-labeled acetic anhydride. Thereby, chemically equivalent, fully acetylated histone species are generated, enabling accurate relative quantification of site-specific lysine acetylation dynamics in tryptic peptides using high-resolution mass spectrometry. We show that CoMetChem enables site-specific quantification of the incorporation or loss of lysine acetylation over time, allowing the determination of reaction rates for acetylation and deacetylation. Thus, the CoMetChem methodology provides a comprehensive description of site-specific acetylation dynamics.
PXD020584	34520123	Formation of a protein corona on the surface of extracellular vesicles in blood plasma. 	Formation of a protein corona on the surface of extracellular vesicles in blood plasma	aggregation, blood plasma, extracellular vesicles, protein corona, rheumatoid arthritis	In this study we tested whether a protein corona is formed around extracellular vesicles (EVs) in blood plasma. We isolated medium-sized nascent EVs of THP1 cells as well as of Optiprep-purified platelets, and incubated them in EV-depleted blood plasma from healthy subjects and from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. EVs were subjected to differential centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, or density gradient ultracentrifugation followed by mass spectrometry. Plasma protein-coated EVs had a higher density compared to the nascent ones and carried numerous newly associated proteins. Interactions between plasma proteins and EVs were confirmed by confocal microscopy, capillary Western immunoassay, immune electron microscopy and flow cytometry. We identified nine shared EV corona proteins (ApoA1, ApoB, ApoC3, ApoE, complement factors 3 and 4B, fibrinogen alpha-chain, immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma2 and gamma4 chains), which appear to be common corona proteins among EVs, viruses and artificial nanoparticles in blood plasma. An unexpected finding of this study was the high overlap of the composition of the protein corona with blood plasma protein aggregates. This is explained by our finding that besides a diffuse, patchy protein corona, large protein aggregates also associate with the surface of EVs. However, while EVs with an external plasma protein cargo induced an increased expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells, EV-free protein aggregates had no effect. In conclusion, our data may shed new light on the origin of the commonly reported plasma protein 'contamination' of EV preparations and may add a new perspective to EV research.
PXD019117	34520625	Phosphoproteomic profiling of the hippocampus of offspring rats exposed to prenatal stress. 	Phosphoproteomic profiling of hippocampus from offspring rats exposed to prenatal stress	Rat, hippocampus	INTRODUCTION: Prenatal stress (PS) can cause depression in offspring. However, the underlying biological mechanism of these influences is still unclear. This work was implemented to investigate the molecular mechanisms of depressive-like behavior of offspring rats insulted with PS. METHODS: Relative quantitative phosphoproteomics of the hippocampus of PS susceptibility (PS-S) and control (CON) rat offspring was performed using  liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to confirm known pathways and to identify new mechanisms involved in depression. RESULTS: A total of 6790 phosphopeptides, 9817 phosphorylation sites, and 2978 phosphoproteins were detected. Among the 2978 phosphoproteins, 1760 (59.09%) had more than two phosphorylated sites, the ENSRNOP00000023460 protein had more than 117 phosphorylated sites, and the average distribution of modification sites per 100 amino acids was 2.97. There were 197 different phosphopeptides, including 140 increased phosphopeptides and 57 decreased phosphopeptides in the PS-S offspring rats, compared to the CON offspring rats. These differential phosphopeptides corresponded to 100 upregulated and 44 downregulated phosphoproteins, respectively. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that these different phosphoproteins in the top five enriched terms in the cellular component, molecular function, and biological proces categories were involved in a total of 35 different phosphoproteins, and these phosphoproteins were mainly related to myelin-, microtubule- and synapse-associated proteins. The enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathways was found to be involved in many essential biological pathways, and the top five pathways included amphetamine addiction, insulin secretion, Cushing syndrome, and the circadian entrainment signaling pathway. These first five pathways were related to nine phosphoproteins, including Adcy9, Apc, Cacna1c, Camk2a, Camk2b, Camk2g, Ctnnd2, Grin2a, and Stx1a. The full data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD019117. CONCLUSION: We preliminarily identified 144 different phosphoproteins involved in myelin, microtubule, and synapse formation and plasticity in the hippocampus of susceptible offspring rats exposed to PS.
PXD026912	34521823	MAD2L2 dimerization and TRIP13 control shieldin activity in DNA repair. 	MAD2L2 dimerization and TRIP13 control shieldin activity in DNA repair	DNA repair, MAD2L2, NHEJ, TRIP13, shieldin	MAD2L2 (REV7) plays an important role in DNA double-strand break repair. As a member of the shieldin complex, consisting of MAD2L2, SHLD1, SHLD2 and SHLD3, it controls DNA repair pathway choice by counteracting DNA end-resection. Here we investigated the requirements for shieldin complex assembly and activity. Besides a dimerization-surface, HORMA-domain protein MAD2L2 has the extraordinary ability to wrap its C-terminus around SHLD3, likely creating a very stable complex. We show that appropriate function of MAD2L2 within shieldin requires its dimerization, mediated by SHLD2 and accelerating MAD2L2-SHLD3 interaction. Dimerization-defective MAD2L2 impairs shieldin assembly and fails to promote NHEJ. Moreover, MAD2L2 dimerization, along with the presence of SHLD3, allows shieldin to interact with the TRIP13 ATPase, known to drive topological switches in HORMA-domain proteins. We find that appropriate levels of TRIP13 are important for proper shieldin (dis)assembly and activity in DNA repair. Together our data provide important insights in the dependencies for shieldin activity.
PXD019987	34522290	MULocDeep: A deep-learning framework for protein subcellular and suborganellar localization prediction with residue-level interpretation. 	MULocDeep: An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Protein Localization Prediction with Sub-organelle Resolution	Protein targeting, deep learning, plant mitochondria isolation, protein localization prediction, shotgun proteomics	Prediction of protein localization plays an important role in understanding protein function and mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a general deep learning-based localization prediction framework, MULocDeep, which can predict multiple localizations of a protein at both subcellular and suborganellar levels. We collected a dataset with 44 suborganellar localization annotations in 10 major subcellular compartments-the most comprehensive suborganelle localization dataset to date. We also experimentally generated an independent dataset of mitochondrial proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures, Solanum tuberosum tubers, and Vicia faba roots and made this dataset publicly available. Evaluations using the above datasets show that overall, MULocDeep outperforms other major methods at both subcellular and suborganellar levels. Furthermore, MULocDeep assesses each amino acid's contribution to localization, which provides insights into the mechanism of protein sorting and localization motifs.

PXD022691	34522866	Deep proteome profiling of human mammary epithelia at lineage and age resolution. 	Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling of human myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells	LEPs, MEPs, phosphoprotteomics	Age is the major risk factor in most carcinomas, yet little is known about how proteomes change with age in any human epithelium. We present comprehensive proteomes comprised of >9,000 total proteins and >15,000 phosphopeptides from normal primary human mammary epithelia at lineage resolution from ten women ranging in age from 19 to 68 years. Data were quality controlled and results were biologically validated with cell-based assays. Age-dependent protein signatures were identified using differential expression analyses and weighted protein co-expression network analyses. Upregulation of basal markers in luminal cells, including KRT14 and AXL, were a prominent consequence of aging. PEAK1 was identified as an age-dependent signaling kinase in luminal cells, which revealed a potential age-dependent vulnerability for targeted ablation. Correlation analyses between transcriptome and proteome revealed age-associated loss of proteostasis regulation. Age-dependent proteome changes in the breast epithelium identified heretofore unknown potential therapeutic targets for reducing breast cancer susceptibility.
PXD009910	34522942	An experimental design to extract more information from MS-based histone studies. 	An experimental design to extract more information from MS-based histone studies	HDAC, histone post-translational modifications, identification	Histone-based chromatin organization paved the way for eukaryotic genome complexity. Because of their key role in information management, the histone posttranslational modifications (hPTM), which mediate their function, have evolved into an alphabet that has more letters than there are amino acids, together making up the "histone code". The resulting combinatorial complexity is manifold higher than what is usually encountered in proteomics. Consequently, a considerably bigger part of the acquired MSMS spectra remains unannotated to date. Adapted search parameters can dig deeper into the dark histone ion space, but the lack of false discovery rate (FDR) control and the high level of ambiguity when searching combinatorial PTMs makes it very hard to assess whether the newly assigned ions are informative. Therefore, we propose an easily adoptable time-lapse enzymatic deacetylation (HDAC1) of a commercial histone extract as a quantify-first strategy that allows isolating ion populations of interest, when studying e.g. acetylation on histones, that currently remain in the dark. By adapting search parameters to study potential issues in sample preparation, data acquisition and data analysis, we stepwise managed to double the portion of annotated precursors of interest from 10.5% to 21.6%. This strategy is intended to make up for the lack of validated FDR control and has led to several adaptations of our current workflow that will reduce the portion of the dark histone ion space in the future. Finally, this strategy can be applied with any enzyme targeting a modification of interest.
PXD026989	34523981	Characterization of the O-Glycoproteome of Tannerella forsythia. 	O-glycoproteome of Tannerella forsythia	O-glycosylation, Tannerella forsythia, Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid	Tannerella forsythia is a Gram-negative oral pathogen known to possess an O-glycosylation system responsible for targeting multiple proteins associated with virulence at the three-residue motif (D)(S/T)(A/I/L/V/M/T). Multiple proteins have been identified to be decorated with a decasaccharide glycan composed of a poorly defined core plus a partially characterized species-specific section. To date, glycosylation studies have focused mainly on the two S-layer glycoproteins, TfsA and TfsB, so the true extent of glycosylation within this species has not been fully explored. In the present study, we characterize the glycoproteome of T. forsythia by employing FAIMS-based glycopeptide enrichment of a cell membrane fraction. We demonstrate that at least 13 glycans are utilized within the T. forsythia glycoproteome, varying with respect to the presence of the three terminal sugars and the presence of fucose and digitoxose residues at the reducing end. To improve the localization of glycosylation events and enhance the detection of glycopeptides, we utilized trifluoromethanesulfonic acid treatment to allow the selective chemical cleavage of glycans. Reducing the chemical complexity of glycopeptides dramatically improved the number of glycopeptides identified and our ability to localize glycosylation sites by ETD fragmentation, leading to the identification of 312 putative glycosylation sites in 145 glycoproteins. Glycosylation site analysis revealed that glycosylation occurs on a much broader motif than initially reported, with glycosylation found at (D)(S/T)(A/I/L/V/M/T/S/C/G/F). The prevalence of this broader glycosylation motif in the genome suggests the existence of hundreds of potential O-glycoproteins in this organism. IMPORTANCE Tannerella forsythia is an oral pathogen associated with severe forms of periodontal disease characterized by destruction of the tooth's supporting tissues, including the bone. The bacterium releases a variety of proteins associated with virulence on the surface of outer membrane vesicles. There is evidence that these proteins are modified by glycosylation, and this modification is essential for virulence in producing disease. We have utilized novel techniques coupled with mass spectrometry to identify over 13 glycans and 312 putative glycosylation sites in 145 glycoproteins within T. forsythia. Glycosylation site analysis revealed that this modification occurs on a much broader motif than initially reported such that there is a high prevalence of potential glycoproteins in this organism that may help to explain its role in periodontal disease.
PXD027697	34523988	Proteogenomic Analysis Provides Novel Insight into Genome Annotation and Nitrogen Metabolism in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120. 	Proteogenomic annotation provides new insight into nitrogen metabolism of Nostoc sp. PCC 7120	Nitrogen metabolism, Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, Novel events, Post-translational modifications (PTMs), Proteogenomics, Re-annotation	Cyanobacteria, capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, play a vital role in nitrogen and carbon cycles. Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (Nostoc 7120) is a model cyanobacterium commonly used to study cell differentiation and nitrogen metabolism. Although its genome was released in 2002, a high-quality genome annotation remains unavailable for this model cyanobacterium. Therefore, in this study, we performed an in-depth proteogenomic analysis based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) data to refine the genome annotation of Nostoc 7120. We unambiguously identified 5,519 predicted protein-coding genes and revealed 26 novel genes, 75 revised genes, and 27 different kinds of posttranslational modifications in Nostoc 7120. A subset of these novel proteins were further validated at both the mRNA and peptide levels. Functional analysis suggested that many newly annotated proteins may participate in nitrogen or cadmium/mercury metabolism in Nostoc 7120. Moreover, we constructed an updated Nostoc 7120 database based on our proteogenomic results and presented examples of how the updated database could be used to improve the annotation of proteomic data. Our study provides the most comprehensive annotation of the Nostoc 7120 genome thus far and will serve as a valuable resource for the study of nitrogen metabolism in Nostoc 7120. IMPORTANCE Cyanobacteria are a large group of prokaryotes capable of oxygenic photosynthesis and play a vital role in nitrogen and carbon cycles on Earth. Nostoc 7120 is a commonly used model cyanobacterium for studying cell differentiation and nitrogen metabolism. In this study, we presented the first comprehensive draft map of the Nostoc 7120 proteome and a wide range of posttranslational modifications. In addition, we constructed an updated database of Nostoc 7120 based on our proteogenomic results and presented examples of how the updated database could be used for system-level studies of Nostoc 7120. Our study provides the most comprehensive annotation of Nostoc 7120 genome and a valuable resource for the study of nitrogen metabolism in this model cyanobacterium.
PXD027799	34524823	Reversible Click Chemistry Tag for Universal Proteome Sample Preparation for Top-Down and Bottom-Up Analysis. 	Reversible Click Chemistry Tag for Universal Proteome Sample Preparation	Click chemistry, Sample Preparation	Successful proteome analysis requires reliable sample preparation beginning with protein solubilization and ending with a sample free of contaminants, ready for downstream analysis. Most proteome sample preparation technologies utilize precipitation or filter-based separation, both of which have significant disadvantages. None of the current technologies are able to prepare both intact proteins or digested peptides. Here, we introduce a reversible protein tag, ProMTag, that enables whole proteome capture, cleanup, and release of intact proteins for top-down analysis. Alternatively, the addition of a novel Trypsin derivative to the workflow generates peptides for bottom-up analysis. We show that the ProMTag workflow yields >90% for intact proteins and >85% for proteome digests. For top-down analysis, ProMTag cleanup improves resolution on 2D gels; for bottom-up exploration, this methodology produced reproducible mass spectrometry results, demonstrating that the ProMTag method is a truly universal approach that produces high-quality proteome samples compatible with multiple downstream analytical techniques. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027799.
PXD024038	34526379	Quantitative proteomics identifies PTP1B as modulator of B cell antigen receptor signaling. 	Quantitative Proteomics Identifies  Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B as Modulator of B Cell Antigen Receptor Signaling	BCR signaling, CRISPR, PTP1B knockout, Ramos B cells, SILAC, Whole proteome analysis	B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling is initiated by protein kinases and limited by counteracting phosphatases that currently are less well studied in their regulation of BCR signaling. Here, we used the B cell line Ramos to identify and quantify human B cell signaling components. Specifically, a protein tyrosine phosphatase profiling revealed a high expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in Ramos and human naive B cells. The loss of PTP1B leads to increased B cell activation. Through substrate trapping in combination with quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified 22 putative substrates or interactors of PTP1B. We validated Igalpha, CD22, PLCgamma1/2, CBL, BCAP, and APLP2 as specific substrates of PTP1B in Ramos B cells. The tyrosine kinase BTK and the two adaptor proteins GRB2 and VAV1 were identified as direct binding partners and potential substrates of PTP1B. We showed that PTP1B dephosphorylates the inhibitory receptor protein CD22 at phosphotyrosine 807. We conclude that PTP1B negatively modulates BCR signaling by dephosphorylating distinct phosphotyrosines in B cell-specific receptor proteins and various downstream signaling components.
PXD021851	34526589	Porphyromonas gingivalis induces entero-hepatic metabolic derangements with alteration of gut microbiota in a type 2 diabetes mouse model. 	Periodontal pathogen induces entero-hepatic metabolic derangements in type 2 diabetic mouse model	feces, metaproteome, mouse liver	Periodontal infection induces systemic inflammation; therefore, aggravating diabetes. Orally administered periodontal pathogens may directly alter the gut microbiota. We orally treated obese db/db diabetes mice using Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg). We screened for Pg-specific peptides in the intestinal fecal specimens and examined whether Pg localization influenced the intestinal microbiota profile, in turn altering the levels of the gut metabolites. We evaluated whether the deterioration in fasting hyperglycemia was related to the changes in the intrahepatic glucose metabolism, using proteome and metabolome analyses. Oral Pg treatment aggravated both fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia (P < 0.05), with a significant (P < 0.01) increase in dental alveolar bone resorption. Pg-specific peptides were identified in fecal specimens following oral Pg treatment. The intestinal Pg profoundly altered the gut microbiome profiles at the phylum, family, and genus levels; Prevotella exhibited the largest increase in abundance. In addition, Pg-treatment significantly altered intestinal metabolite levels. Fasting hyperglycemia was associated with the increase in the levels of gluconeogenesis-related enzymes and metabolites without changes in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance. Oral Pg administration induced gut microbiota changes, leading to entero-hepatic metabolic derangements, thus aggravating hyperglycemia in an obese type 2 diabetes mouse model.
PXD025328	34526721	Structural basis of human transcription-DNA repair coupling. 	Structural basis of human transcription-DNA repair coupling	Protein-protein crosslinking, Transcription-DNA repair, Ubiquitination analysis	Transcription-coupled DNA repair removes bulky DNA lesions from the genome(1,2) and protects cells against ultraviolet (UV) irradiation(3). Transcription-coupled DNA repair begins when RNA polymerase II (Pol II) stalls at a DNA lesion and recruits the Cockayne syndrome protein CSB, the E3 ubiquitin ligase, CRL4(CSA) and UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA)(3). Here we provide five high-resolution structures of Pol II transcription complexes containing human transcription-coupled DNA repair factors and the elongation factors PAF1 complex (PAF) and SPT6. Together with biochemical and published(3,4) data, the structures provide a model for transcription-repair coupling. Stalling of Pol II at a DNA lesion triggers replacement of the elongation factor DSIF by CSB, which binds to PAF and moves upstream DNA to SPT6. The resulting elongation complex, EC(TCR), uses the CSA-stimulated translocase activity of CSB to pull on upstream DNA and push Pol II forward. If the lesion cannot be bypassed, CRL4(CSA) spans over the Pol II clamp and ubiquitylates the RPB1 residue K1268, enabling recruitment of TFIIH to UVSSA and DNA repair. Conformational changes in CRL4(CSA) lead to ubiquitylation of CSB and to release of transcription-coupled DNA repair factors before transcription may continue over repaired DNA.
PXD022300	34526723	Dairying enabled Early Bronze Age Yamnaya steppe expansions. 	Dairying enabled Early Bronze Age Yamnaya steppe expansions	Ancient Proteins, Dairy, Pastoralism, Pontic Caspian Region, Steppe	During the Early Bronze Age, populations of the western Eurasian steppe expanded across an immense area of northern Eurasia. Combined archaeological and genetic evidence supports widespread Early Bronze Age population movements out of the Pontic-Caspian steppe that resulted in gene flow across vast distances, linking populations of Yamnaya pastoralists in Scandinavia with pastoral populations (known as the Afanasievo) far to the east in the Altai Mountains(1,2) and Mongolia(3). Although some models hold that this expansion was the outcome of a newly mobile pastoral economy characterized by horse traction, bulk wagon transport(4-6) and regular dietary dependence on meat and milk(5), hard evidence for these economic features has not been found. Here we draw on proteomic analysis of dental calculus from individuals from the western Eurasian steppe to demonstrate a major transition in dairying at the start of the Bronze Age. The rapid onset of ubiquitous dairying at a point in time when steppe populations are known to have begun dispersing offers critical insight into a key catalyst of steppe mobility. The identification of horse milk proteins also indicates horse domestication by the Early Bronze Age, which provides support for its role in steppe dispersals. Our results point to a potential epicentre for horse domestication in the Pontic-Caspian steppe by the third millennium BC, and offer strong support for the notion that the novel exploitation of secondary animal products was a key driver of the expansions of Eurasian steppe pastoralists by the Early Bronze Age.
PXD026918	34526899	Dengzhanxixin Injection Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment Through a Neuroprotective Mechanism Based on Mitochondrial Preservation in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke. 	The therapeutic mechanism of Dengzhanxixin injection on middle cerebral artery occlusion rats based on proteomics	Dengzhanxixin injection, MCAO rat, TMT proteomics, acute ischemic stroke, brain ischemic core tissue	Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a global health burden and cognitive impairment is one of its most serious complication. Adequate interventions for AIS may have the potential to improve cognitive outcomes. In the present study, we selected Erigeron breviscapus (Vaniot) Hand.-Mazz. injection (Dengzhanxixin injection, DZXI), a widely used Chinese herbal injection, in contrast to edaravone as the positive control drug to test its potential to ameliorates neurological and cognitive impairments caused by AIS. We performed a 2-week randomized trial with these two drugs in AIS patients presenting mild to moderate cognitive impairments. Neuropsychological tests and MRI examinations showed that DZXI attenuated the neurological and cognitive impairments of patients and protected the grey matter in specific regions from ischemic damage. Notably, DZXI exerted better effects than edaravone in some neuropsychological tests, probably due to the protective effect of DZXI on grey matter. To explore the therapeutic mechanisms, we carried out an experiment with a middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model. We found that DZXI decreased the infarct volume and increased the survival of neuronal cells in the ischemic penumbra; furthermore, DZXI modulated the mitochondrial respiratory chain process and preserved the mitochondrial structure in the brain tissue. Overall, our data suggested that the administration of DZXI is effective at ameliorating neurological and cognitive impairments in AIS, and the underlying mechanisms are related to the protective effects of DZXI on cerebral neurons and neuronal mitochondria.
PXD027958	34526909	Inhibition of a Novel CLK1-THRAP3-PPARgamma Axis Improves Insulin Sensitivity. 	Inhibition of a novel CLK1-THRAP3-PPARgamma axis improves insulin sensitivity	CLK1, Insulin sensitivity, PPARgamma, THRAP3, browning	Increasing energy expenditure by promoting "browning" in adipose tissues is a promising strategy to prevent obesity and associated diabetes. To uncover potential targets of cold exposure, which induces energy expenditure, we performed phosphoproteomics profiling in brown adipose tissue of mice housed in mild cold environment at 16degreesC. We identified CDC2-like kinase 1 (CLK1) as one of the kinases that were significantly downregulated by mild cold exposure. In addition, genetic knockout of CLK1 or chemical inhibition in mice ameliorated diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance at 22degreesC. Through proteomics, we uncovered thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 3 (THRAP3) as an interacting partner of CLK1, further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. We further demonstrated that CLK1 phosphorylates THRAP3 at Ser243, which is required for its regulatory interaction with phosphorylated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), resulting in impaired adipose tissue browning and insulin sensitivity. These data suggest that CLK1 plays a critical role in controlling energy expenditure through the CLK1-THRAP3-PPARgamma axis.
PXD027695	34527671	A Novel Classifier Based on Urinary Proteomics for Distinguishing Between Benign and Malignant Ovarian Tumors. 	A Novel Classifier Based on Urinary Proteomics for Distinguishing between Benign and Malignant Ovarian Tumors	machine learning, non-invasive biomarkers, ovarian cancer, urinary proteomics	BACKGROUND: Preoperative differentiation of benign and malignant tumor types is critical for providing individualized treatment interventions to improve prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. High-throughput proteomics analysis of urine samples was performed to identify reliable and non-invasive biomarkers that could effectively discriminate between the two ovarian tumor types. METHODS: In total, 132 urine samples from 73 malignant and 59 benign cases of ovarian carcinoma were divided into C1 (training and test datasets) and C2 (validation dataset) cohorts. Mass spectrometry (MS) data of all samples were acquired in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode with an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and analyzed using DIA-NN software. The generated classifier was trained with Random Forest algorithm from the training dataset and validated in the test and validation datasets. Serum CA125 and HE4 levels were additionally determined in all patients. Finally, classification accuracy of the classifier, serum CA125 and serum HE4 in all samples were evaluated and plotted via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: In total, 2,199 proteins were quantified and 69 identified with differential expression in benign and malignant groups of the C1 cohort. A classifier incorporating five proteins (WFDC2, PTMA, PVRL4, FIBA, and PVRL2) was trained and validated in this study. Evaluation of the performance of the classifier revealed AUC values of 0.970 and 0.952 in the test and validation datasets, respectively. In all 132 patients, AUCs of 0.966, 0.947, and 0.979 were achieved with the classifier, serum CA125, and serum HE4, respectively. Among eight patients with early stage malignancy, 7, 6, and 4 were accurately diagnosed based on classifier, serum CA125, and serum HE4, respectively. CONCLUSION: The novel classifier incorporating a urinary protein panel presents a promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for classifying benign and malignant ovarian tumors.
PXD024748	34528139	Multiomic Analyses of Dopaminergic Neurons Isolated from Human Substantia Nigra in Parkinson's Disease: A Descriptive and Exploratory Study. 	Polyomic analyses of dopaminergic neurons isolated from human substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease: An exploratory study.	Parkinson's disease, Proteomics ., Transcriptomics, dopaminergic neurons, human brain tissue, laser micro-dissection	Dopaminergic neurons (DA) of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) selectively and progressively degenerate in Parkinson's disease (PD). Until now, molecular analyses of DA in PD have been limited to genomic or transcriptomic approaches, whereas, to the best of our knowledge, no proteomic or combined multiomic study examining the protein profile of these neurons is currently available. In this exploratory study, we used laser capture microdissection to extract regions from DA in 10 human SNpc obtained at autopsy in PD patients and control subjects. Extracted RNA and proteins were identified by RNA sequencing and nanoliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively, and the differential expression between PD and control group was assessed. Qualitative analyses confirmed that the microdissection protocol preserves the integrity of our samples and offers access to specific molecular pathways. This multiomic analysis highlighted differential expression of 52 genes and 33 proteins, including molecules of interest already known to be dysregulated in PD, such as LRP2, PNMT, CXCR4, MAOA and CBLN1 genes, or the Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 protein. On the other hand, despite the same samples were used for both analyses, correlation between RNA and protein expression was low, as exemplified by the CST3 gene encoding for the cystatin C protein. This is the first exploratory study analyzing both gene and protein expression of laser-dissected neuronal parts from SNpc in PD. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD024748 and via GEO with identifier GSE 169755.
PXD022255	34528284	Non-genetic and genetic rewiring underlie adaptation to hypomorphic alleles of an essential gene. 	TMT-MS2_cellular adaptation to hypomorphic alleles of essential gene NUP58	CRISPR-Cas9, NUP58, TMT-MS2, cellular adaptation, essential gene	Adaptive evolution to cellular stress is a process implicated in a wide range of biological and clinical phenomena. Two major routes of adaptation have been identified: non-genetic changes, which allow expression of different phenotypes in novel environments, and genetic variation achieved by selection of fitter phenotypes. While these processes are broadly accepted, their temporal and epistatic features in the context of cellular evolution and emerging drug resistance are contentious. In this manuscript, we generated hypomorphic alleles of the essential nuclear pore complex (NPC) gene NUP58. By dissecting early and long-term mechanisms of adaptation in independent clones, we observed that early physiological adaptation correlated with transcriptome rewiring and upregulation of genes known to interact with the NPC; long-term adaptation and fitness recovery instead occurred via focal amplification of NUP58 and restoration of mutant protein expression. These data support the concept that early phenotypic plasticity allows later acquisition of genetic adaptations to a specific impairment. We propose this approach as a genetic model to mimic targeted drug therapy in human cells and to dissect mechanisms of adaptation.
PXD020105	34528388	APOBEC3C, a nucleolar protein induced by genotoxins, is excluded from DNA damage sites. 	APOBEC3C, a perinucleolar protein induced by genotoxins, is recruited to DNA damage sites	APOBEC3C, DNA damage, cancer, genotoxins, human cells	The human genome contains 11 APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like) cytidine deaminases classified into four families. These proteins function mainly in innate antiviral immunity and can also restrict endogenous retrotransposable element multiplication. The present study focuses on APOBEC3C (A3C), a member of the APOBEC3 subfamily. Some APOBEC3 proteins use their enzymatic activity on genomic DNA, inducing mutations and DNA damage, while other members facilitate DNA repair. Our results show that A3C is highly expressed in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Its expression is regulated by p53. Depletion of A3C slightly decreases proliferation and does not affect DNA repair via homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining. The A3C interactomes obtained from control cells and cells exposed to the genotoxin etoposide indicated that A3C is a nucleolar protein. This was confirmed by the detection of either endogenous or ectopic A3C in nucleoli. Interestingly, we show that A3C is excluded from areas of DNA breaks in live cells. Our data also indicate that the C-terminal part of A3C is responsible for its nucleolar localization and exclusion from DNA damage sites.
PXD025551	34528699	Quantitative global proteome and phosphorylome analyses reveal potential biomarkers in kidney cancer. 	Quantitative global Proteome and Phosphorylome Analyses Reveal Potential Biomarkers in Kidney Cancer	Biomarkers, Pathways, Phosphorylomes, Proteomes, Renal cell carcinoma	Currently, high-throughput quantitative proteomic and transcriptomic approaches have been widely used for exploring the molecular mechanisms and acquiring biomarkers for cancers. Our study aimed to illuminate the multi-dimensional molecular mechanisms underlying renal cell carcinoma (RCC) via investigating the quantitative global proteome and the profile of phosphorylation. A total of 5,428 proteins and 8,632 phosphorylation sites were quantified in RCC tissues, with 709 proteins and 649 phosphorylation sites found to be altered in expression compared with the matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. These differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in metabolic process terms involving the glycolysis pathway, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism which have been considered to be a potential mechanism of RCC progression. Moreover, phosphorylation analysis indicated that these upregulated phosphorylated proteins are implicated in the glucagon signaling pathway and cholesterol metabolism, while the downregulated phosphorylated proteins were found to be predominantly involved in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, carbon metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids. In addition, several new candidate proteins, CD14, MPO, NCF2, SOD2, PARP1, were found to be upregulated and MUT, ACADM, PCK1 were downregulated in RCC. These proteins may be recognized as new biomarkers for RCC. These findings could broaden our insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of RCC and identify candidate biomarkers for the treatment of RCC.
PXD023316	34528736	Platelet biomarkers identifying mild cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes patients. 	Platelet biomarkers identifying mild cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes patients	Alzheimers disease, Mild cognitive impairment, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, optineurin, peripheral biomarkers, platelet	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an independent risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, identifying periphery biomarkers correlated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is of importance for early diagnosis of AD. Here, we performed platelet proteomics in T2DM patients with MCI (T2DM-MCI) and without MCI (T2DM-nMCI). Pearson analysis of the omics data with MMSE (mini-mental state examination), Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 (beta-amyloid), and rGSK-3beta(T/S9) (total to Serine-9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta) revealed that mitophagy/autophagy-, insulin signaling-, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways-related proteins were most significantly involved. Among them, only the increase of optineurin, an autophagy-related protein, was simultaneously correlated with the reduced MMSE score, and the increased Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 and rGSK-3beta(T/S9), and the optineurin alone could discriminate T2DM-MCI from T2DM-nMCI. Combination of the elevated platelet optineurin and rGSK-3beta(T/S9) enhanced the MCI-discriminating efficiency with AUC of 0.927, specificity of 86.7%, sensitivity of 85.3%, and accuracy of 0.859, which is promising for predicting cognitive decline in T2DM patients.
PXD024780	34529408	NHS-Ester Tandem Labeling in One Pot Enables 48-Plex Quantitative Proteomics. 	NHS-Ester Tandem Labeling in One Pot for 48-Plex Proteomics	48-plex proteomics, TMTpro, mTRAQ	Stable-isotope labeling strategies are extensively used for multiplex quantitative proteomics. Hybrid-isotope labeling strategies that combine the use of isotopic mass difference labeling and isobaric tags can greatly increase sample multiplexity. In this work, we present a novel hybrid-isotope labeling approach that we termed NHS-ester tandem labeling in one pot (NETLOP). We first optimized 16-plex isobaric TMTpro labeling of lysine residues followed by 2-plex or 3-plex isotopic mTRAQ labeling of peptide N-termini, both of which with commercially available NHS-ester reactive reagents. We then demonstrated the utility of the NETLOP approach by labeling HeLa cell samples and performing proof-of-principle quantitative 32-plex and 48-plex proteomic analyses, each in a single LC-MS/MS experiment. Compared to current hybrid-isotope labeling methods, our NETLOP approach requires no sample cleanup between different labeling steps to minimize sample loss, induces no retention time shifts that compromise quantification accuracy, can be adapted to other NHS-ester isotopic labeling reagents to further increase multiplexity, and is compatible with samples from any origin in a wide array of biological and clinical proteomics applications.
PXD019536	34530157	Global Insights Into Lysine Acylomes Reveal Crosstalk Between Lysine Acetylation and Succinylation in Streptomyces coelicolor Metabolic Pathways. 	Global insights into lysine acetylome in Streptomyces coelicolor	Streptomyces colicolor, lysine acetylation, post-translational modification	Lysine acylations are reversible and ubiquitous post-translational modifications that play critical roles in regulating multiple cellular processes. In the current study, highly abundant and dynamic acetylation, besides succinylation, was uncovered in a soil bacterium, Streptomyces coelicolor. By affinity enrichment using anti-acetyl-lysine antibody and the following LC-MS/MS analysis, a total of 1298 acetylation sites among 601 proteins were identified. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that these acetylated proteins have diverse subcellular localization and were enriched in a wide range of biological functions. Specifically, a majority of the acetylated proteins were also succinylated in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and protein translation pathways, and the bimodification occurred at the same sites in some proteins. The acetylation and succinylation sites were quantified by knocking out either the deacetylase ScCobB1 or the desuccinylase ScCobB2, demonstrating a possible competitive relationship between the two acylations. Moreover, in vitro experiments using synthetically modified peptides confirmed the regulatory crosstalk between the two sirtuins, which may be involved in the collaborative regulation of cell physiology. Collectively, these results provided global insights into the S. coelicolor acylomes and laid a foundation for characterizing the regulatory roles of the crosstalk between lysine acetylation and succinylation in the future.

Our previous study found that SVV replicates extremely faster in porcine Instituto Biologico-Rim Suino-2 (IBRS-2) cells than that in porcine kidney-15 (PK-15) cells. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we comprehensively compared the expression features between IBRS-2 cells and PK-15 cells in response to SVV infection by an unbiased high-throughput quantitative proteomic analysis. We found that the innate immune response-related pathways were efficiently activated in PK-15 cells but not in IBRS-2 cells during SVV infection. A large amount of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes were induced in PK-15 cells. In contrast, no IFN-stimulated genes were induced in IBRS-2 cells. Besides, we determined similar results in the two cell lines infected by another porcine picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus. Further study demonstrated that the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway was functioning properly in both IBRS-2 and PK-15 cells. A systematic screening study revealed that the aberrant signal transduction from TANK-binding kinase 1 to IFN regulatory factor 3 in the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor signaling pathway in IBRS-2 cells was the fundamental cause of the different innate immune response manifestation and different viral replication rate in the two cell lines. Together, our findings determined the different features of IBRS-2 and PK-15 cell lines, which will help for clarification of the pathogenesis of SVV. Besides, identification of the underlying mechanisms will provide new targets and an insight for decreasing the viral clearance rate and probably improve the oncolytic effect by SVV in cancer cells.
PXD025597	34531323	Activation loop phosphorylation of a non-RD receptor kinase initiates plant innate immune signaling. 	ALLOSTERIC ACTIVATION OF A PLANT IMMUNE RECEPTOR KINASE COMPLEX	innate immunity., pattern recognition receptor, phosphorylation, protein kinase, receptor kinase	Receptor kinases (RKs) are fundamental for extracellular sensing and regulate development and stress responses across kingdoms. In plants, leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) are primarily peptide receptors that regulate responses to myriad internal and external stimuli. Phosphorylation of LRR-RK cytoplasmic domains is among the earliest responses following ligand perception, and reciprocal transphosphorylation between a receptor and its coreceptor is thought to activate the receptor complex. Originally proposed based on characterization of the brassinosteroid receptor, the prevalence of complex activation via reciprocal transphosphorylation across the plant RK family has not been tested. Using the LRR-RK ELONGATION FACTOR TU RECEPTOR (EFR) as a model, we set out to understand the steps critical for activating RK complexes. While the EFR cytoplasmic domain is an active protein kinase in vitro and is phosphorylated in a ligand-dependent manner in vivo, catalytically deficient EFR variants are functional in antibacterial immunity. These results reveal a noncatalytic role for EFR in triggering immune signaling and indicate that reciprocal transphoshorylation is not a ubiquitous requirement for LRR-RK complex activation. Rather, our analysis of EFR along with a detailed survey of the literature suggests a distinction between LRR-RKs with RD- versus non-RD protein kinase domains. Based on newly identified phosphorylation sites that regulate the activation state of the EFR complex in vivo, we propose that LRR-RK complexes containing a non-RD protein kinase may be regulated by phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes of the ligand-binding receptor, which could initiate signaling either allosterically or through driving the dissociation of negative regulators of the complex.
PXD020193	34531373	Pyroptosis inhibition improves the symptom of acute myocardial infarction. 	The proteins detection in the Early Stage of Myocardial Infarction	Myocardial Infarction	Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the leading cause of mortality worldwide, is a rapidly developing and irreversible disease. Therefore, proper prompt intervention at the early stage of AMI is crucial for its treatment. However, the molecular features in the early stage have not been clarified. Here, we constructed mouse AMI model and profiled transcriptomes and proteomes at the early stages of AMI progress. Immune system was extensively activated at 6-h AMI. Then, pyroptosis was activated at 24-h AMI. VX-765 treatment, a pyroptosis inhibitor, significantly reduced the infarct size and improved the function of cardiomyocytes. Besides, we identified that WIPI1, specifically expressed in heart, was significantly upregulated at 1 h after AMI. Moreover, WIPI1 expression is significantly higher in the peripheral blood of patients with AMI than healthy control. WIPI1 can serve as a potential early diagnostic biomarker for AMI. It likely decelerates AMI progress by activating autophagy pathways. These findings shed new light on gene expression dynamics in AMI progress, and present a potential early diagnostic marker and a candidate drug for clinical pre-treatment to prolong the optimal cure time.
PXD025809	34531401	Hecw controls oogenesis and neuronal homeostasis by promoting the liquid state of ribonucleoprotein particles. 	Pulldown CG42797 vs S2 cell lysate	drosophila	Specialised ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are a hallmark of polarized cells, like neurons and germ cells. Among their main functions is the spatial and temporal modulation of the activity of specific mRNA transcripts that allow specification of primary embryonic axes. While RNPs composition and role are well established, their regulation is poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that Hecw, a newly identified Drosophila ubiquitin ligase, is a key modulator of RNPs in oogenesis and neurons. Hecw depletion leads to the formation of enlarged granules that transition from a liquid to a gel-like state. Loss of Hecw activity results in defective oogenesis, premature aging and climbing defects associated with neuronal loss. At the molecular level, reduced ubiquitination of the Fmrp impairs its translational repressor activity, resulting in altered Orb expression in nurse cells and Profilin in neurons.
PXD024216	34531462	Shotgun-based proteomics of extracellular vesicles in Alzheimer's disease reveals biomarkers involved in immunological and coagulation pathways. 	Shotgun-based Proteomics of Extracellular Vesicles in Alzheimer's Disease Reveals Biomarkers Involved in Immunological and Coagulation Pathways	Alzheimer, Biomarkers, Blood, Extracellular Vesicles, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Plasma, Shotgun proteomics	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and without readily available clinical biomarkers. Blood-derived proteins are routinely used for diagnostics; however, comprehensive plasma profiling is challenging due to the dynamic range in protein concentrations. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can cross the blood-brain barrier and may provide a source for AD biomarkers. We investigated plasma-derived EV proteins for AD biomarkers from 10 AD patients, 10 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients, and 9 healthy controls (Con) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The ultracentrifuged EVs were washed and confirmed according to the MISEV2018 guidelines. Some AD patients presented with highly elevated FXIIIA1 (log2 FC: 4.6, p-value: 0.005) and FXIIIB (log2 FC: 4.9, p-value: 0.018). A panel of proteins was identified discriminating Con from AD (AUC: 0.91, CI: 0.67-1.00) with ORM2 (AUC: 1.00, CI: 1.00-1.00), RBP4 (AUC: 0.99, CI: 0.95-1.00), and HYDIN (AUC: 0.89, CI: 0.72-1.00) were found especially relevant for AD. This indicates that EVs provide an easily accessible matrix for possible AD biomarkers. Some of the MCI patients, with similar protein profiles as the AD group, progressed to AD within a 2-year timespan.
PXD025630	34531572	Wittig reagents for chemoselective sulfenic acid ligation enables global site stoichiometry analysis and redox-controlled mitochondrial targeting. 	Wittig reagents for chemoselective sulfenic acid ligation enables global site stoichiometry analysis and redox-controlled mitochondrial targeting	S-sulfenylation, WyneN	Triphenylphosphonium ylides, known as Wittig reagents, are one of the most commonly used tools in synthetic chemistry. Despite their considerable versatility, Wittig reagents have not yet been explored for their utility in biological applications. Here we introduce a chemoselective ligation reaction that harnesses the reactivity of Wittig reagents and the unique chemical properties of sulfenic acid, a pivotal post-translational cysteine modification in redox biology. The reaction, which generates a covalent bond between the ylide nucleophilic alpha-carbon and electrophilic gamma-sulfur, is highly selective, rapid and affords robust labelling under a range of biocompatible reaction conditions, which includes in living cells. We highlight the broad utility of this conjugation method to enable site-specific proteome-wide stoichiometry analysis of S-sulfenylation and to visualize redox-dependent changes in mitochondrial cysteine oxidation and redox-triggered triphenylphosphonium generation for the controlled delivery of small molecules to mitochondria.
PXD011871	34532265	Discovery of bladder cancer biomarkers in paired pre- and postoperative urine samples. 	Urinary proteomics of bladder cancer	Bladder cancer, Urinary proteomics, iTRAQ	BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BC), a common cancer of the urinary system, has a low mortality but an extremely high recurrence rate. Patients who have undergone initial surgical treatment often undergo frequent prognostic examinations with a substantial burden of discomfort and costs. Urine samples can reflect early disease processes in the urinary system and may be an excellent source of biomarkers. METHODS: In the present study, we used the liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to perform proteomic analysis of pre- and postoperative urine samples from patients with stage III BC to identify biomarkers of cancer prognosis. Candidate biomarkers from proteomic analysis were simultaneously validated using western blotting in an independent cohort and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, combined with gene expression data of BC samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). RESULTS: The comparison of pre- and postoperative urine samples from the same patients led to the discovery of several significantly differentially expressed proteins, whose functions could be closely related to the occurrence and development of BC. We confirmed a representative group of candidate biomarker molecules, such as cadherin-related family member 2 (CDHR2), heat shock protein beta-1 (HSP27), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1). CONCLUSIONS: The candidate biomarker molecules can distinguish between pre- and postoperative urine samples, and alterations in their expression levels are significantly associated with recurrence rates in patients with BC. Therefore, these molecules may become useful biomarkers for the monitoring and prognosis of BC.
PXD026226	34532864	RASSF1C oncogene elicits amoeboid invasion, cancer stemness, and extracellular vesicle release via a SRC/Rho axis. 	RASSF1C oncogene elicits amoeboid invasion, cancer stemness and invasive EVs via a novel SRC/Rho axis	Exosome, Rassf1C	Cell plasticity is a crucial hallmark leading to cancer metastasis. Upregulation of Rho/ROCK pathway drives actomyosin contractility, protrusive forces, and contributes to the occurrence of highly invasive amoeboid cells in tumors. Cancer stem cells are similarly associated with metastasis, but how these populations arise in tumors is not fully understood. Here, we show that the novel oncogene RASSF1C drives mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition and stem cell attributes in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, RASSF1C activates Rho/ROCK via SRC-mediated RhoGDI inhibition, resulting in generation of actomyosin contractility. Moreover, we demonstrate that RASSF1C-induced amoeboid cells display increased expression of cancer stem-like markers such as CD133, ALDH1, and Nanog, and are accompanied by higher invasive potential in vitro and in vivo. Further, RASSF1C-induced amoeboid cells employ extracellular vesicles to transfer the invasive phenotype to target cells and tissue. Importantly, the underlying RASSF1C-driven biological processes concur to explain clinical data: namely, methylation of the RASSF1C promoter correlates with better survival in early-stage breast cancer patients. Therefore, we propose the use of RASSF1 gene promoter methylation status as a biomarker for patient stratification.
PXD014247	34533192	GRASP55 restricts early-stage autophagy and regulates spatial organization of the early secretory network. 	GRASP Proximity Labeling      .	Autophagy, afinity purification-mass spectrometry, unconventional secretion	There is great interest in understanding the cellular mechanisms controlling autophagy, a tightly regulated catabolic and stress-response pathway. Prior work has uncovered links between autophagy and the Golgi reassembly stacking protein of 55 kDa (GRASP55), but their precise interrelationship remains unclear. Intriguingly, both autophagy and GRASP55 have been functionally and spatially linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)---Golgi interface, broaching this compartment as a site where GRASP55 and autophagy may intersect. Here, we uncover that loss of GRASP55 enhances LC3 puncta formation, indicating that GRASP55 restricts autophagosome formation. Additionally, using proximity-dependent biotinylation, we identify a GRASP55 proximal interactome highly associated with the ER-Golgi interface. Both nutrient starvation and loss of GRASP55 are associated with coalescence of early secretory pathway markers. In light of these findings, we propose that GRASP55 regulates spatial organization of the ER-Golgi interface, which suppresses early autophagosome formation.
PXD024120	34534264	Interactome screening of C9orf72 dipeptide repeats reveals VCP sequestration and functional impairment by polyGA. 	Interactome screening of C9orf72 dipeptide repeats reveals sequestration and functional impairment of VCP by polyGA	ALS, BioID, VCP, Valosin-containing protein, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, dipeptide repeats, neurodegeneration, proximity labeeling	Repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are a common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, two devastating neurodegenerative disorders. One of the proposed mechanisms of GGGGCC repeat expansion is their translation into non-canonical dipeptide repeats, which can then accumulate as aggregates and contribute to these pathologies. There are five different dipeptide repeat proteins (polyGA, polyGR, polyPR, polyPA and polyGP), some of which are known to be neurotoxic. In the present study, we used BioID2 proximity labelling to identify the interactomes of all five dipeptide repeat proteins consisting of 125 repeats each. We identified 113 interacting partners for polyGR, 90 for polyGA, 106 for polyPR, 25 for polyPA and 27 for polyGP. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the proteomic data revealed that these target interaction partners are involved in a variety of functions, including protein translation, signal transduction pathways, protein catabolic processes, amide metabolic processes and RNA-binding. Using autopsy brain tissue from patients with C9orf72 expansion complemented with cell culture analysis, we evaluated the interactions between polyGA and valosin containing protein (VCP). Functional analysis of this interaction revealed sequestration of VCP with polyGA aggregates, altering levels of soluble valosin-containing protein. VCP also functions in autophagy processes, and consistent with this, we observed altered autophagy in cells expressing polyGA. We also observed altered co-localization of polyGA aggregates and p62 in cells depleted of VCP. All together, these data suggest that sequestration of VCP with polyGA aggregates contributes to the loss of VCP function, and consequently to alterations in autophagy processes in C9orf72 expansion disorders.
PXD026046	34534547	A peptide CORO1C-47aa encoded by the circular noncoding RNA circ-0000437 functions as a negative regulator in endometrium tumor angiogenesis. 	A peptide CORO1C-47aa encoded by circ-0000437 functions as a negative regulator in endometrium tumor angiogenesis	VEGF, angiogenesis, endometrial cancer, functional peptide, hsa-circ-0000437	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of widespread noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in mammals. Recent studies demonstrate that functional peptides can be encoded by short open reading frames in noncoding RNAs, including circRNAs. However, the role of circRNAs in various physiological and pathological states, such as cancer, is not well understood. In this study, through deep RNA sequencing on human endometrial cancer (EC) samples and their paired adjacent normal tissues, we uncovered that the circRNA hsa-circ-0000437 is significantly reduced in EC compared with matched paracancerous tissue. The hsa-circ-0000437 contains a short open reading frame encoding a functional peptide termed CORO1C-47aa. Overexpression of CORO1C-47aa is capable of inhibiting angiogenesis at the initiation stage by suppressing endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation through competition with transcription factor TACC3 to bind to ARNT and suppress VEGF. CORO1C-47aa directly bound to ARNT through the PAS-B domain, and blocking the association between ARNT and TACC3, which led to reduced expression of VEGF, ultimately lead to reduced angiogenesis. The antitumor effects of CORO1C-47aa on EC progression suggest that CORO1C-47aa has potential value in anticarcinoma therapies and warrants further investigation.
PXD023817	34535262	Basic pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography (bRPLC) in combination with tip-based strong cation exchange (SCX-Tip), ReST, an efficient approach for large-scale cross-linked peptide analysis. 	Reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) in Combination with Tip-Based Strong Cation Exchange (SCX-Tip) Fractionation, ReST, an Alternative Approach for Cross-linked Peptides analysis	Chemical cross-linking, Fractionation, SCX-Tip	Chemical cross-linking in combination with mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has emerged as a useful method for structural elucidation of proteins and protein complexes. Due to the low stoichiometry of cross-linked peptides, a specific enrichment method is always necessary prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, especially for complex samples. Currently, strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and affinity tag-based enrichment are among the widely used enrichment strategies. Herein, we present a two-dimensional strategy combining basic pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography (bRPLC) fractionation and tip-based SCX (SCX-Tip) enrichment, termed ReST, for the characterization of cross-linked peptides. We revealed the unbiased separation effects of the bRPLC in the cross-linked peptide fractionation. We optimized the enrichment conditions of SCX-Tip using well-designed cross-linked peptides. Taking advantage of the high resolution of bRPLC separation and the high enrichment efficiency of SCX-Tip, we were able to identify 43.6% more cross-linked peptides than the conventional SCX approach. The presented ReST is a simple and efficient approach for proteome-scale protein-protein interaction studies.
PXD025823	34535671	METTL3-mediated m(6)A RNA methylation promotes the anti-tumour immunity of natural killer cells. 	Protemics of Mettl3-deficient NK cells	Mettl3, NK, Protemics	Natural killer (NK) cells exert critical roles in anti-tumor immunity but how their functions are regulated by epitranscriptional modification (e.g., N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation) is unclear. Here we report decreased expression of the m(6)A "writer" METTL3 in tumor-infiltrating NK cells, and a positive correlation between protein expression levels of METTL3 and effector molecules in NK cells. Deletion of Mettl3 in NK cells alters the homeostasis of NK cells and inhibits NK cell infiltration and function in the tumor microenvironment, leading to accelerated tumor development and shortened survival in mice. The gene encoding SHP-2 is m(6)A modified, and its protein expression is decreased in METTL3-deficient NK cells. Reduced SHP-2 activity renders NK cells hyporesponsive to IL-15, which is associated with suppressed activation of the AKT and MAPK signaling pathway in METTL3-deficient NK cells. These findings show that m(6)A methylation safeguards the homeostasis and tumor immunosurveillance function of NK cells.
PXD027841	34535749	Discovery of a small protein-encoding cis-regulatory overlapping gene of the tumor suppressor gene Scribble in humans. 	Targeted LC-MS/MS analysis of oSCRIB protein in HeLa cells.	HeLa, PRM	Intensive gene annotation has revealed many functional and regulatory elements in the human genome. Although eukaryotic protein-coding genes are generally transcribed into monocistronic mRNAs, recent studies have discovered additional short open reading frames (sORFs) in mRNAs. Here, we performed proteogenomic data mining for hidden proteins categorized into sORF-encoded polypeptides (SEPs) in human cancers. We identified a new SEP-encoding overlapping sORF (oORF) on the cell polarity determinant Scribble (SCRIB) that is considered a proto-oncogene with tumor suppressor function in Hippo-YAP/TAZ, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. Reanalysis of clinical human proteomic data revealed translational dysregulation of both SCRIB and its oORF, oSCRIB, during carcinogenesis. Biochemical analyses suggested that the translatable oSCRIB constitutively limits the capacity of eukaryotic ribosomes to translate the downstream SCRIB. These findings provide a new example of cis-regulatory oORFs that function as a ribosomal roadblock and potentially serve as a fail-safe mechanism to normal cells for non-excessive downstream gene expression, which is hijacked in cancer.
PXD026569	34537366	A quantitative metabolic analysis reveals Acetobacterium woodii as a flexible and robust host for formate-based bioproduction. 	A quantitative metabolic analysis reveals Acetobacterium woodii as a flexible and robust host for formate-based bioproduction	Formate bioeconomy, acetogens, continuous fermentation, metabolic modelling, mixed gas fermentation, omics analysis, substrate co-utilization	Cheap and renewable feedstocks such as the one-carbon substrate formate are emerging for sustainable production in a growing chemical industry. We investigated the acetogen Acetobacterium woodii as a potential host for bioproduction from formate alone and together with autotrophic and heterotrophic co-substrates by quantitatively analyzing physiology, transcriptome, and proteome in chemostat cultivations in combination with computational analyses. Continuous cultivations with a specific growth rate of 0.05 h(-1) on formate showed high specific substrate uptake rates (47 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). Co-utilization of formate with H2, CO, CO2 or fructose was achieved without catabolite repression and with acetate as the sole metabolic product. A transcriptomic comparison of all growth conditions revealed a distinct adaptation of A. woodii to growth on formate as 570 genes were changed in their transcript level. Transcriptome and proteome showed higher expression of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway during growth on formate and gaseous substrates, underlining its function during utilization of one-carbon substrates. Flux balance analysis showed varying flux levels for the WLP (0.7-16.4 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) and major differences in redox and energy metabolism. Growth on formate, H2/CO2, and formate + H2/CO2 resulted in low energy availability (0.20-0.22 ATP/acetate) which was increased during co-utilization with CO or fructose (0.31 ATP/acetate for formate + H2/CO/CO2, 0.75 ATP/acetate for formate + fructose). Unitrophic and mixotrophic conversion of all substrates was further characterized by high energetic efficiencies. In silico analysis of bioproduction of ethanol and lactate from formate and autotrophic and heterotrophic co-substrates showed promising energetic efficiencies (70-92%). Collectively, our findings reveal A. woodii as a promising host for flexible and simultaneous bioconversion of multiple substrates, underline the potential of substrate co-utilization to improve the energy availability of acetogens and encourage metabolic engineering of acetogenic bacteria for the efficient synthesis of bulk chemicals and fuels from sustainable one carbon substrates.
PXD023099	34538334	Fecal multi-omics analysis reveals diverse molecular alterations of gut ecosystem in COVID-19 patients. 	Molecular Phenomics of the Gut Ecosystem in COVID-19 Patients	COVID-19, Lipidomics, Metabolomics, Metaproteomics, SARS-CoV-2, Stool	Gut ecosystem has profound effects on host physiology and health. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were frequently observed in patients with COVID-19. Compared with other organs, gut antiviral response can result in more complicated immune responses because of the interactions between the gut microbiota and host immunity. However, there are still large knowledge gaps in the impact of COVID-19 on gut molecular profiles and commensal microbiome, hindering our comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the treatment of COVID-19. We performed longitudinal stool multi-omics profiling to systemically investigate the molecular phenomics alterations of gut ecosystem in COVID-19. Gut proteomes of COVID-19 were characterized by disturbed immune, proteolysis and redox homeostasis. The expression and glycosylation of proteins involved in neutrophil degranulation and migration were suppressed, while those of proteases were upregulated. The variable domains of Ig heavy chains were downregulated and the overall glycosylation of IgA heavy chain constant regions, IgGFc-binding protein, and J chain were suppressed with glycan-specific variations. There was a reduction of beneficial gut bacteria and an enrichment of bacteria derived deleterious metabolites potentially associated with multiple types of diseases (such as ethyl glucuronide). The reduction of Ig heave chain variable domains may contribute to the increase of some Bacteroidetes species. Many bacteria ceramide lipids with a C17-sphingoid based were downregulated in COVID-19. In many cases, the gut phenome did not restore two months after symptom onset. Our study indicates widely disturbed gut molecular profiles which may play a role in the development of symptoms in COVID-19. Our findings also emphasis the need for ongoing investigation of the long-term gut molecular and microbial alterations during COVID-19 recovery process. Considering the gut ecosystem as a potential target could offer a valuable approach in managing the disease.
PXD027219	34539397	Integrated Proteomics and Metabolomics Link Acne to the Action Mechanisms of Cryptotanshinone Intervention. 	Integrated Proteomics and Metabolomics Link Acne to the Action Mechanisms of Cryptotanshinone Intervention	Acne, Cryptotanshinone, Label-free Proteomic, action mechanisms, metabolomics	The label-free methods of proteomic combined with metabolomics were applied to explore the mechanisms of Cryptotanshinone (CPT) intervention in rats with acne. The model group consisted of rats given oleic acid (MC), then treated with CPT, while control groups did not receive treatment. The skin samples were significantly different between control, model and CPT-treated groups in hierarchical clustering dendrogram. Obvious separations of the skin metabolic profiles from the three groups were found through PCA scoring. In total, 231 and 189 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in MC and CPT groups, respectively. By the KEGG analysis, five protein and metabolite pathways were found to be significantly altered. These played important roles in response to oleic acid-induced acne and drug treatment. CPT could negatively regulate glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and histidine metabolisms to decrease keratinocyte differentiation and improve excessive keratinization and cellular barrier function. CPT could down-regulate the IL-17 signaling pathway and regulate the acne-driven immune response of sebum cells. The biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism and linoleic acid pathways could significantly alter sebum production and control sebaceous gland secretion after CPT treatment. The gap junction was up-regulated after CPT treatment and the skin barrier turned back to normal. Krt 14, Krt 16 and Krt 17 were significantly down-regulated, decreasing keratinization, while inflammatory cell infiltration was improved by down-regulation of Msn, up-regulation of linoleic acid and estrogen pathways after CPT treatment. These results propose action mechanisms for the use of CPT in acne, as a safe and potential new drug.
PXD025894	34540668	Proteomics Analysis Identified ASNS as a Novel Biomarker for Predicting Recurrence of Skull Base Chordoma. 	Human skull base chordoma LC-MSMS	Skull base chordoma	BACKGROUND: The prognostic factors of skull base chordoma associated with outcomes of patients after surgery remain inadequately identified. This study was designed to identify a novel prognostic factor for patients with skull base chordoma. METHOD: Using a proteomic technique, the tumor biomarkers that were upregulated in the rapid-recurrence group of chordoma were screened and then narrowed down by bioinformatic analysis. Finally one potential biomarker was chosen for validation by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarray (TMA). A total of 187 patients included in TMA were randomly divided into two cohorts, the training cohort included 93 patients and the validation cohort included 94 patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess the patients' survival. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used to identify prognostic factors predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS). CCK-8 assay, clonal formation assay and transwell assay were used to test the effect of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) on the proliferation, migration and invasion in chordoma cell lines. RESULTS: Among 146 upregulated proteins, ASNS was chosen as a potential prognostic biomarker after bioinformatics analysis. The H-scores of ASNS ranged from 106.27 to 239.58 in TMA. High expression of ASNS was correlated with shorter RFS in both the training cohort (p = 0.0093) and validation cohort (p < 0.001). Knockdown of ASNS by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited the growth, colony formation, migration and invasion of chordoma cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that high expression of ASNS is correlated with poor prognosis of patients with skull base chordoma. ASNS may be a useful prognostic factor for patients with skull base chordoma.
PXD027000	34542927	SRSF protein kinase 1 modulates RAN translation and suppresses CGG repeat toxicity. 	CGG repeat RNA binding protein capture identifies SRSF protein kinase 1 as a modulator of RAN translation and suppressor of repeat toxicity	RAN translation, repeat RNA	Transcribed CGG repeat expansions cause neurodegeneration in Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). CGG repeat RNAs sequester RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) into nuclear foci and undergo repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation into toxic peptides. To identify proteins involved in these processes, we employed a CGG repeat RNA-tagging system to capture repeat-associated RBPs by mass spectrometry in mammalian cells. We identified several SR (serine/arginine-rich) proteins that interact selectively with CGG repeats basally and under cellular stress. These proteins modify toxicity in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. Pharmacologic inhibition of serine/arginine protein kinases (SRPKs), which alter SRSF protein phosphorylation, localization, and activity, directly inhibits RAN translation of CGG and GGGGCC repeats (associated with C9orf72 ALS/FTD) and triggers repeat RNA retention in the nucleus. Lowering SRPK expression suppressed toxicity in both FXTAS and C9orf72 ALS/FTD model flies, and SRPK inhibitors suppressed CGG repeat toxicity in rodent neurons. Together, these findings demonstrate roles for CGG repeat RNA binding proteins in RAN translation and repeat toxicity and support further evaluation of SRPK inhibitors in modulating RAN translation associated with repeat expansion disorders.
PXD028113	34543622	Quantification of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) content in biological samples. 	Quantification of mitochondrial Complex I	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Human Proteome Project, Mitochondrial Complex I, ProteomeXchange project tag: Cardiovascular (B/D-HPP), flavin, ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, native page	Impairments in mitochondrial energy metabolism have been implicated in human genetic diseases associated with mitochondrial and nuclear DNA mutations, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and aging. Alteration in mitochondrial complex I structure and activity has been shown to play a key role in Parkinson's disease and ischemia/reperfusion tissue injury, but significant difficulty remains in assessing the content of this enzyme complex in a given sample. The present study introduces a new method utilizing native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with flavin fluorescence scanning to measure the absolute content of complex I, as well as alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, in any preparation. We show that complex I content is 19 +/- 1 pmol/mg of protein in the brain mitochondria, whereas varies up to 10-fold in different mouse tissues. Together with the measurements of NADH-dependent specific activity, our method also allows accurate determination of complex I catalytic turnover, which was calculated as 10(4) min(-1) for NADH:ubiquinone reductase in mouse brain mitochondrial preparations. alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex content was determined to be 65 +/- 5 and 123 +/- 9 pmol/mg protein for mouse brain and bovine heart mitochondria, respectively. Our approach can also be extended to cultured cells, and we demonstrated that about 90 x 10(3) complex I molecules are present in a single human embryonic kidney 293 cell. The ability to determine complex I content should provide a valuable tool to investigate the enzyme status in samples after in vivo treatment in mutant organisms, cells in culture, or human biopsies.

Analysis of RNA polymerase II interacting proteins in wild-type and spt6-1004 yeast cells.	RNAPII, S. cerevisiae, Spt6, TMT	The histone chaperone Spt6 is involved in promoting elongation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), maintaining chromatin structure, regulating cotranscriptional histone modifications, and controlling mRNA processing. These diverse functions of Spt6 are partly mediated through its interactions with RNAPII and other factors in the transcription elongation complex. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to characterize the differences in RNAPII-interacting factors between wildtype cells and those depleted for Spt6, leading to the identification of proteins that depend on Spt6 for their interaction with RNAPII. The altered association of some of these factors could be attributed to changes in steady-state protein levels. However, Abd1, the mRNA cap methyltransferase, had decreased association with RNAPII after Spt6 depletion despite unchanged Abd1 protein levels, showing a requirement for Spt6 in mediating the Abd1-RNAPII interaction. Genome-wide studies showed that Spt6 is required for maintaining the level of Abd1 over transcribed regions, as well as the level of Spt5, another protein known to recruit Abd1 to chromatin. Abd1 levels were particularly decreased at the 5' ends of genes after Spt6 depletion, suggesting a greater need for Spt6 in Abd1 recruitment over these regions. Together, our results show that Spt6 is important in regulating the composition of the transcription elongation complex and reveal a previously unknown function for Spt6 in the recruitment of Abd1.
PXD008288	34543761	Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of the oral bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis to identify protein features relevant in biofilm formation. 	Proteomic analysis of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms and planktonic cultures when grown as mono- or dual-species models	Bacterial biofilms, Biofilm phenotype, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Label-free quantitative proteomics., Planktonic bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis	BACKGROUND: The opportunistic pathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis are Gram-negative bacteria associated with oral biofilm and periodontal disease. This study investigated interactions between F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis proteomes with the objective to identify proteins relevant in biofilm formation. METHODS: We applied liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to determine the expressed proteome of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis cells grown in biofilm or planktonic culture, and as mono- and dual-species models. The detected proteins were classified into functional categories and their label-free quantitative (LFQ) intensities statistically compared. RESULTS: The proteomic analyses detected 1,322 F. nucleatum and 966 P. gingivalis proteins, including abundant virulence factors. Using univariate statistics, we identified significant changes between biofilm and planktonic culture (p-value <=0.05) in 0,4% F. nucleatum, 7% P. gingivalis, and 14% of all proteins in the dual-species model. For both species, proteins involved in vitamin B2 (riboflavin) metabolism had significantly increased levels in biofilm. In both mono- and dual-species biofilms, P. gingivalis increased the production of proteins for translation, oxidation-reduction, and amino acid metabolism compared to planktonic cultures. However, when we compared LFQ intensities between mono- and dual-species, over 90% of the significantly changed P. gingivalis proteins had their levels reduced in biofilm and planktonic settings of the dual-species model. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that P. gingivalis reduces the production of multiple proteins because of the F. nucleatum presence. The results highlight the complex interactions of bacteria contributing to oral biofilms, which need to be considered in the design of prevention strategies.
PXD025778	34543857	STAT3 contributes to cisplatin resistance, modulating EMT markers, and the mTOR signaling in lung adenocarcinoma. 	STAT3 contributes to cisplatin resistance, modulating EMT markers and the mTOR signaling in lung adenocarcinoma cells .	Cisplatin, Lung Cancer, Rapamycin., STAT3, mTOR	Lung cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide and is strongly associated with cisplatin resistance. The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is constitutively activated in cancer cells and coordinates critical cellular processes as survival, self-renewal, and inflammation. In several types of cancer, STAT3 controls the development, immunogenicity, and malignant behavior of tumor cells while it dictates the responsiveness to radio- and chemotherapy. It is known that STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser727 by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is necessary for its maximal activation, but the crosstalk between STAT3 and mTOR signaling in cisplatin resistance remains elusive. In this study, using a proteomic approach, we revealed important targets and signaling pathways altered in cisplatin-resistant A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. STAT3 had increased expression in a resistance context, which can be associated with a poor prognosis. STAT3 knockout (SKO) resulted in a decreased mesenchymal phenotype in A549 cells, observed by clonogenic potential and by the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. Importantly, SKO cells did not acquire the mTOR pathway overactivation induced by cisplatin resistance. Consistently, SKO cells were more responsive to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin and presented impairment of the feedback activation loop in Akt. Therefore, rapamycin was even more potent in inhibiting the clonogenic potential in SKO cells and sensitized to cisplatin treatment. Mechanistically, STAT3 partially coordinated the cisplatin resistance phenotype via the mTOR pathway in non-small cell lung cancer. Thus, our findings reveal important targets and highlight the significance of the crosstalk between STAT3 and mTOR signaling in cisplatin resistance. The synergic inhibition of STAT3 and mTOR potentially unveil a potential mechanism of synthetic lethality to be explored for human lung cancer treatment.
PXD015621	34545810	Impaired mRNA splicing and proteostasis in preadipocytes in obesity-related metabolic disease. 	Characterization of the human preadipoyte proteome	iTRAQ, preadipocytes	Preadipocytes are crucial for healthy adipose tissue expansion. Preadipocyte differentiation is altered in obese individuals, which has been proposed to contribute to obesity-associated metabolic disturbances. Here, we aimed at identifying the pathogenic processes underlying impaired adipocyte differentiation in obese individuals with insulin resistance (IR)/type 2 diabetes (T2D). We report that down-regulation of a key member of the major spliceosome, PRFP8/PRP8, as observed in IR/T2D preadipocytes from subcutaneous (SC) fat, prevented adipogenesis by altering both the expression and splicing patterns of adipogenic transcription factors and lipid droplet-related proteins, while adipocyte differentiation was restored upon recovery of PRFP8/PRP8 normal levels. Adipocyte differentiation was also compromised under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) hyperactivation, as occurs in SC and omental (OM) preadipocytes in IR/T2D obesity. Thus, targeting mRNA splicing and ER proteostasis in preadipocytes could improve adipose tissue function and thus contribute to metabolic health in obese individuals.
PXD025765	34547329	Conformational Changes of RORgamma During Response Element Recognition and Coregulator Engagement. 	HDX-MS Analysis of RORg:RORE:SRC3 Complexes	Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry, Protein-DNA Interaction, Protein-Protein Interaction, RORg, RORg Response Elements, SRC3	The retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (RORgamma) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor of the nuclear receptor super family that underpins metabolic activity, immune function, and cancer progression. Despite being a valuable drug target in health and disease, our understanding of the ligand-dependent activities of RORgamma is far from complete. Like most nuclear receptors, RORgamma must recruit coregulatory protein to enact the RORgamma target gene program. To date, a majority of structural studies have been focused exclusively on the RORgamma ligand-binding domain and the ligand-dependent recruitment of small peptide segments of coregulators. Herein, we examine the ligand-dependent assembly of full length RORgamma:coregulator complexes on cognate DNA response elements using structural proteomics and small angle x-ray scattering. The results from our studies suggest that RORgamma becomes elongated upon DNA recognition, preventing long range interdomain crosstalk. We also determined that the DNA binding domain adopts a sequence-specific conformation, and that coregulatory protein may be able to 'sense' the ligand- and DNA-bound status of RORgamma. We propose a model where ligand-dependent coregulator recruitment may be influenced by the sequence of the DNA to which RORgamma is bound. Overall, the efforts described herein will illuminate important aspects of full length RORgamma and monomeric orphan nuclear receptor target gene regulation through DNA-dependent conformational changes.
PXD025882	34547431	Effective protein extraction combined with data independent acquisition analysis reveals a comprehensive and quantifiable insight into the proteomes of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. 	A COMPREHENSIVE AND QUANTIFIABLE INSIGHT INTO THE PROTEOMES OF ARTICULAR CARTILAGE AND SUBCHONDRAL BONE	Subchondral bone, cartilage, equine, osteoarthritis, spectral library	OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study was to establish a sensitive and reproducible method to map the cartilage and subchondral bone proteomes in quantitative terms, and mine the proteomes for proteins of particular interest in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). The horse was used as a model animal. DESIGN: Protein was extracted from articular cartilage and subchondral bone samples from three horses in triplicate by pressure cycling technology or ultrasonication. Digested proteins were analysed by data independent acquisition based mass spectrometry. Data was processed using a pre-established spectral library as reference database (FDR 1%). RESULTS: We identified to our knowledge the hitherto most comprehensive quantitative cartilage (1758 proteins) and subchondral bone (1482 proteins) proteomes in all species presented to date. Both extraction methods were sensitive and reproducible and the high consistency of the identified proteomes (>97% overlap) indicated that both methods preserved the diversity among the extracted proteins. Proteome mining revealed a substantial number of quantifiable cartilage and bone matrix proteins and proteins involved in osteogenesis and bone remodeling, including ACAN, BGN, PRELP, FMOD, COMP, ACP5, BMP3, BMP6, BGLAP, TGFB1, IGF1, ALP, MMP3, and collagens. A number of proteins, including COMP and TNN, were identified in different protein isoforms with potential unique biological roles. CONCLUSION: We have successfully developed two sensitive and reproducible non-species specific workflows enabling a comprehensive quantitative insight into the proteomes of cartilage and subchondral bone. This facilitates the prospect of investigating the molecular events at the osteochondral unit in the pathogenesis of OA in future projects.
PXD022302	34548610	Prenylcysteine oxidase 1, an emerging player in atherosclerosis. 	Effects of prenylcysteine oxidase 1 (PCYOX1) silencing on HepG2 cell secretome	HepG2, PCYOX1, secretome	The research into the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis has considerably increased our understanding of the disease complexity, but still many questions remain unanswered, both mechanistically and pharmacologically. Here, we provided evidence that the pro-oxidant enzyme Prenylcysteine Oxidase 1 (PCYOX1), in the human atherosclerotic lesions, is both synthesized locally and transported within the subintimal space by proatherogenic lipoproteins accumulating in the arterial wall during atherogenesis. Further, Pcyox1 deficiency in Apoe(-/-) mice retards atheroprogression, is associated with decreased features of lesion vulnerability and lower levels of lipid peroxidation, reduces plasma lipid levels and inflammation. PCYOX1 silencing in vitro affects the cellular proteome by influencing multiple functions related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and platelet adhesion. Collectively, these findings identify the pro-oxidant enzyme PCYOX1 as an emerging player in atherogenesis and, therefore, understanding the biology and mechanisms of all functions of this unique enzyme is likely to provide additional therapeutic opportunities in addressing atherosclerosis.
PXD024233	34551281	Reading ADP-ribosylation signaling using chemical biology and interaction proteomics. 	Reading ADP-ribosylation signalling using chemical biology and interaction proteomics	ADP-ribosylation, ADPr-binding proteins	ADP-ribose (ADPr) readers are essential components of ADP-ribosylation signaling, which regulates genome maintenance and immunity. The identification and discrimination between monoADPr (MAR) and polyADPr (PAR) readers is difficult because of a lack of suitable affinity-enrichment reagents. We synthesized well-defined ADPr probes and used these for affinity purifications combined with relative and absolute quantitative mass spectrometry to generate proteome-wide MAR and PAR interactomes, including determination of apparent binding affinities. Among the main findings, MAR and PAR readers regulate various common and distinct processes, such as the DNA-damage response, cellular metabolism, RNA trafficking, and transcription. We monitored the dynamics of PAR interactions upon induction of oxidative DNA damage and uncovered the mechanistic connections between ubiquitin signaling and ADP-ribosylation. Taken together, chemical biology enables exploration of MAR and PAR readers using interaction proteomics. Furthermore, the generated MAR and PAR interaction maps significantly expand our current understanding of ADPr signaling.
PXD020544	34551289	PBRM1 loss in kidney cancer unbalances the proximal tubule master transcription factor hub to repress proximal tubule differentiation. 	PBRM1 loss in kidney cancer imbalances the proximal tubule master transcription factor hub to repress proximal tubule differentiation	PBRM1 PAX8 Differentiation	PBRM1, a subunit of the PBAF coactivator complex that transcription factors use to activate target genes, is genetically inactivated in almost all clear cell renal cell cancers (RCCs). Using unbiased proteomic analyses, we find that PAX8, a master transcription factor driver of proximal tubule epithelial fates, recruits PBRM1/PBAF. Reverse analyses of the PAX8 interactome confirm recruitment specifically of PBRM1/PBAF and not functionally similar BAF. More conspicuous in the PAX8 hub in RCC cells, however, are corepressors, which functionally oppose coactivators. Accordingly, key PAX8 target genes are repressed in RCC versus normal kidneys, with the loss of histone lysine-27 acetylation, but intact lysine-4 trimethylation, activation marks. Re-introduction of PBRM1, or depletion of opposing corepressors using siRNA or drugs, redress coregulator imbalance and release RCC cells to terminal epithelial fates. These mechanisms thus explain RCC resemblance to the proximal tubule lineage but with suppression of the late-epithelial program that normally terminates lineage-precursor proliferation.
PXD008798	34551310	Brown adipocyte ATF4 activation improves thermoregulation and systemic metabolism. 	Lrpprc deficiency in brown adipocytes diminishes cold-induced thermogenesis but improves systemic metabolism	LCMS, mitochondria	Cold-induced thermogenesis in endotherms demands adaptive thermogenesis fueled by mitochondrial respiration and Ucp1-mediated uncoupling in multilocular brown adipocytes (BAs). However, dietary regulation of thermogenesis in BAs isn't fully understood. Here, we describe that the deficiency of Leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing-protein (Lrpprc) in BAs reduces mtDNA-encoded ETC gene expression, causes ETC proteome imbalance, and abolishes the mitochondria-fueled thermogenesis. BA-specific Lrpprc knockout mice are cold resistant in a 4degreesC cold-tolerance test in the presence of food, which is accompanied by the activation of transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and proteome turnover in BAs. ATF4 activation genetically by BA-specific ATF4 overexpression or physiologically by a low-protein diet feeding can improve cold tolerance in wild-type and Ucp1 knockout mice. Furthermore, ATF4 activation in BAs improves systemic metabolism in obesogenic environment regardless of Ucp1's action. Therefore, our study reveals a diet-dependent but Ucp1-independent thermogenic mechanism in BAs that is relevant to systemic thermoregulation and energy homeostasis.
PXD027329	34551960	Computational Analysis of Cholangiocarcinoma Phosphoproteomes Identifies Patient-Specific Drug Targets. 	Computational analysis of cholangiocarcinoma phosphoproteomes identifies patient-specific drug targets	Cholangiocarcinoma	Cholangiocarcinoma is a form of hepatobiliary cancer with an abysmal prognosis. Despite advances in our understanding of cholangiocarcinoma pathophysiology and its genomic landscape, targeted therapies have not yet made a significant impact on its clinical management. The low response rates of targeted therapies in cholangiocarcinoma suggest that patient heterogeneity contributes to poor clinical outcome. Here we used mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics and computational methods to identify patient-specific drug targets in patient tumors and cholangiocarcinoma-derived cell lines. We analyzed 13 primary tumors of patients with cholangiocarcinoma with matched nonmalignant tissue and 7 different cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, leading to the identification and quantification of more than 13,000 phosphorylation sites. The phosphoproteomes of cholangiocarcinoma cell lines and patient tumors were significantly correlated. MEK1, KIT, ERK1/2, and several cyclin-dependent kinases were among the protein kinases most frequently showing increased activity in cholangiocarcinoma relative to nonmalignant tissue. Application of the Drug Ranking Using Machine Learning (DRUML) algorithm selected inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC; belinostat and CAY10603) and PI3K pathway members as high-ranking therapies to use in primary cholangiocarcinoma. The accuracy of the computational drug rankings based on predicted responses was confirmed in cell-line models of cholangiocarcinoma. Together, this study uncovers frequently activated biochemical pathways in cholangiocarcinoma and provides a proof of concept for the application of computational methodology to rank drugs based on efficacy in individual patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Phosphoproteomic and computational analyses identify patient-specific drug targets in cholangiocarcinoma, supporting the potential of a machine learning method to predict personalized therapies.
PXD008410	34552006	Phosphoproteomics Identifies PI3K Inhibitor-selective Adaptive Responses in Pancreatic Cancer Cell Therapy and Resistance. 	PI3Kinase Isoforms in Pancreatic cancer	PI3K Signaling Pathway Isoforms	The PI3K pathway is highly active in human cancers. The four class I isoforms of PI3K are activated by distinct mechanisms leading to a common downstream signaling. Their downstream redundancy is thought to be responsible for treatment failures of PI3K inhibitors. We challenged this concept, by mapping the differential phosphoproteome evolution in response to PI3K inhibitors with different isoform-selectivity patterns in pancreatic cancer, a disease currently without effective therapy. In this cancer, the PI3K signal was shown to control cell proliferation. We compared the effects of LY294002 that inhibit with equal potency all class I isoenzymes and downstream mTOR with the action of inhibitors with higher isoform selectivity toward PI3Kalpha, PI3Kbeta, or PI3Kgamma (namely, A66, TGX-221 and AS-252424). A bioinformatics global pathway analysis of phosphoproteomics data allowed us to identify common and specific signals activated by PI3K inhibitors supported by the biological data. AS-252424 was the most effective treatment and induced apoptotic pathway activation as well as the highest changes in global phosphorylation-regulated cell signal. However, AS-252424 treatment induced reactivation of Akt, therefore decreasing the treatment outcome on cell survival. Reversely, AS-252424 and A66 combination treatment prevented p-Akt reactivation and led to synergistic action in cell lines and patient organoids. The combination of clinically approved alpha-selective BYL-719 with gamma-selective IPI-549 was more efficient than single-molecule treatment on xenograft growth. Mapping unique adaptive signaling responses to isoform-selective PI3K inhibition will help to design better combinative treatments that prevent the induction of selective compensatory signals.
PXD018307	34552055	SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immunodeficiency in recovered patients by downregulating CD19 expression in B cells via enhancing B-cell metabolism. 	The Analysis of Plasma Metabolome and Lipidome of Patients with COVID-19	COVID-19, lipidome, metabolome, plasma	The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes severe immune disruption. However, it is unclear if disrupted immune regulation still exists and pertains in recovered COVID-19 patients. In our study, we have characterized the immune phenotype of B cells from 15 recovered COVID-19 patients, and found that healthy controls and recovered patients had similar B-cell populations before and after BCR stimulation, but the frequencies of PBC in patients were significantly increased when compared to healthy controls before stimulation. However, the percentage of unswitched memory B cells was decreased in recovered patients but not changed in healthy controls upon BCR stimulation. Interestingly, we found that CD19 expression was significantly reduced in almost all the B-cell subsets in recovered patients. Moreover, the BCR signaling and early B-cell response were disrupted upon BCR stimulation. Mechanistically, we found that the reduced CD19 expression was caused by the dysregulation of cell metabolism. In conclusion, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes immunodeficiency in recovered patients by downregulating CD19 expression in B cells via enhancing B-cell metabolism, which may provide a new intervention target to cure COVID-19.
PXD026100	34552568	Novel Insights Into Cellular Changes in HPV8-E7 Positive Keratinocytes: A Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analysis. 	Effect of HPV8-E7 expression on the secretome of keratinocytes	E7 oncoprotein, Human papillomavirus type 8 (HPV8), keratinocyte transformation, secretome	Human papillomavirus type 8 (HPV8) is associated with the development of non-melanoma skin cancer. In the past we already delved into the mechanisms involved in keratinocyte invasion, showing that the viral E7 oncoprotein is a key player that drives invasion of basal keratinocytes controlled by the extracellular protein fibronectin. To unravel further downstream effects in E7 expressing keratinocytes we now aimed at characterizing gene and protein/phosphoprotein alterations to narrow down on key cellular targets of HPV8-E7. We now show that gene expression of GADD34 and GDF15 are strongly activated in the presence of E7 in primary human keratinocytes. Further analyses of fibronectin-associated factors led to the identification of the Src kinase family members Fyn and Lyn being aberrantly activated in the presence of HPV8-E7. Phospho-proteomics further revealed that E7 not only targets cell polarity and cytoskeletal organization, but also deregulates the phosphorylation status of nuclear proteins involved in DNA damage repair and replication. Many of these differentially phosphorylated proteins turned out to be targets of Fyn and Lyn. Taken together, by using unbiased experimental approaches we have now arrived at a deeper understanding on how fibronectin may affect the signaling cascades in HPV8 positive keratinocytes, which may be key for skin tumorigenesis and that may also aid in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for betaHPV-mediated cancers.
PXD019480	34553132	DNA-guided photoactivatable probe-based chemical proteomics reveals the reader protein of mRNA methylation. 	DNA-guided Photoactivatable Probe-based Chemical Proteomics Reveals the Reader Protein of mRNA Methylation	Epigenetics, mRNA modifications, photo-crosslinking, readers	Chemical modification on mRNA can recruit specific binding proteins (readers/partners) to determine post-transcriptional gene regulation. However, the identification of the reader is extremely limited owing to the rather weak and highly dynamic non-covalent interactions between mRNA modification and reader, and therefore the sensitive and robust approaches are desirable. Here, we report a DNA-guided photoactivatable-based chemical proteomic approach for profiling the readers of mRNA methylation. By use of N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), we illustrated that this method can be successfully utilized for labelling and enriching the readers of mRNA modification, as well as for the discovery of new partners. Thus we applied this strategy to a new modification 2'-O-methyladenosine. As a result, DDX1 was identified and verified as a potential binding protein. Our study therefore provides a powerful chemical proteomics tool for identifying the binding factors of mRNA modification and reveals the underlying function of mRNA modification.
PXD027042	34553437	Expanding the family of extracellular chaperones: Identification of human plasma proteins with chaperone activity. 	Expanding the Family of Extracellular Chaperones: Identification of Plasma Proteins with Chaperone Activity	C1r, C1s, Extracellular Chaperones, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 3, Proteostasis, Prothrombin, Vitronectin	Proteostasis, the balance of protein synthesis, folding and degradation, is essential to maintain cellular function and viability, and the many known intracellular chaperones are recognized as playing key roles in sustaining life. In contrast, the identity of constitutively secreted extracellular chaperones (ECs) and their physiological roles in extracellular proteostasis is less completely understood. We designed and implemented a novel strategy, based on the well-known propensity of chaperones to bind to regions of hydrophobicity exposed on misfolding proteins, to discover new ECs present in human blood. We used a destabilized protein that misfolds at 37degreesC as "bait" to bind to potential ECs in human serum and captured the complexes formed on magnetic beads. Proteins eluted from the beads were identified by mass spectrometry and a group of seven abundant serum proteins was selected for in vitro analysis of chaperone activity. Five of these proteins were shown to specifically inhibit protein aggregation. Vitronectin and plasminogen activator-3 inhibited both the in vitro aggregation of the Alzheimer's beta peptide (Abeta(1-42) ) to form fibrillar amyloid, and the aggregation of citrate synthase (CS) to form unstructured (amorphous) aggregates. In contrast, prothrombin, C1r, and C1s inhibited the aggregation of Abeta(1-42) but did not inhibit CS aggregation. This study thus identified five novel and abundant putative ECs which may play important roles in the maintenance of extracellular proteostasis, and which apparently have differing abilities to inhibit the amorphous and amyloid-forming protein aggregation pathways.
PXD025409	34553759	The Drosophila orthologue of the primary ciliary dyskinesia-associated gene, DNAAF3, is required for axonemal dynein assembly. 	FASP analysis of Drosophila  tissue	FASP Drosophila Cilia	Ciliary motility is powered by a suite of highly conserved axoneme-specific dynein motor complexes. In humans, the impairment of these motors through mutation results in the disease primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Studies in Drosophila have helped to validate several PCD genes whose products are required for cytoplasmic pre-assembly of axonemal dynein motors. Here we report the characterisation of the Drosophila orthologue of the less-known assembly factor DNAAF3. This gene, CG17669 (Dnaaf3), is expressed exclusively in developing mechanosensory chordotonal (Ch) neurons and the cells that generate spermatozoa, The only two Drosophila cell types bearing cilia/flagella containing dynein motors. Mutation of Dnaaf3 results in larvae that are deaf and adults that are uncoordinated, indicating defective Ch neuron function. The mutant Ch neuron cilia of the antenna specifically lack dynein arms, while Ca imaging in larvae reveals a complete loss of Ch neuron response to vibration stimulus, confirming that mechanotransduction relies on ciliary dynein motors. Mutant males are infertile with immotile sperm whose flagella lack dynein arms and show axoneme disruption. Analysis of proteomic changes suggest a reduction in heavy chains of all axonemal dynein forms, consistent with an impairment of dynein pre-assembly.
PXD027830	34553926	Characterization of HLA-A*02:01 MHC Immunopeptide Antigens Enhanced by Ultraviolet Photodissociation Mass Spectrometry. 	Characterization of HLA-A*02:01 MHC Immunopeptide Antigens Enhanced by Ultraviolet Photodissociation Mass Spectrometry	Immunopeptides UVPD	Identifying major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I immunopeptide antigens represents a key step in the development of immune-based targeted therapeutics and vaccines. However, the complete characterization of these antigens by tandem mass spectrometry remains challenging due to their short sequence length, high degree of hydrophobicity, and/or lack of sufficiently basic amino acids. This study seeks to address the potential for 193 nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) to improve the analysis of MHC class I immunopeptides by offering enhanced characterization of these sequences in lower charge states and differentiation of prominent isomeric leucine and isoleucine residues in the HLA-A*02:01 motif. Although electron transfer dissociation-higher energy collisional dissociation (EThcD) offered some success in the differentiation of leucine and isoleucine, 193 nm UVPD was able to confirm the identity of nearly 60% of leucine and isoleucine residues in a synthetic peptide mixture. Furthermore, 193 nm UVPD led to significantly more peptide identifications and higher scoring metrics than EThcD for peptides obtained from immunoprecipitation of MHC class I immunopeptides from in vitro cell culture. Additionally, 193 nm UVPD represents a promising complementary technique to higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD), in which 424 of the 2593 peptides identified by 193 nm UVPD were not identified by HCD in HLA-A*02:01-specific immunoprecipitation and 804 of the 3300 peptides identified by 193 nm UVPD were not identified by HCD for pan HLA-A, -B, and -C immunoprecipitation. These results highlight that 193 nm UVPD offers an option for the characterization of immunopeptides, including differentiation of leucine and isoleucine residues.
PXD025753	34556814	ISGylation drives basal breast tumour progression by promoting EGFR recycling and Akt signalling. 	MDA-MB-231 MS analysis of ISGylome, GDI2 interactome and total proteome changes in different ISGylation models	Breast cancer, EGFR recycling, GDI2, ISG15	ISG15 is an ubiquitin-like modifier that is associated with reduced survival rates in breast cancer patients. The mechanism by which ISG15 achieves this however remains elusive. We demonstrate that modification of Rab GDP-Dissociation Inhibitor Beta (GDI2) by ISG15 (ISGylation) alters endocytic recycling of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in non-interferon stimulated cells using CRISPR-knock out models for ISGylation. By regulating EGFR trafficking, ISGylation enhances EGFR recycling and sustains Akt-signalling. We further show that Akt signalling positively correlates with levels of ISG15 and its E2-ligase in basal breast cancer cohorts, confirming the link between ISGylation and Akt signalling in human tumours. Persistent and enhanced Akt activation explains the more aggressive tumour behaviour observed in human breast cancers. We show that ISGylation can act as a driver of tumour progression rather than merely being a bystander.
PXD017546	34557171	Impact of Tellurite on the Metabolism of Paenibacillus pabuli AL109b With Flagellin Production Explaining High Reduction Capacity. 	Effect of  Tellurite in the proteome of Bacillusand Paenibacillus	Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Tellurite, reduction	Tellurium (Te) is a metalloid with scarce and scattered abundance but with an increased interest in human activity for its uses in emerging technologies. As is seen for other metals and metalloids, the result of mining activity and improper disposal of high-tech devices will lead to niches with increased abundance of Te. This metalloid will be more available to bacteria and represent an increasing selective pressure. This environmental problem may constitute an opportunity to search for microorganisms with genetic and molecular mechanisms of microbial resistance to Te toxic anions. Organisms from Te-contaminated niches could provide tools for Te remediation and fabrication of Te-containing structures with added value. The objective of this study was to determine the ability of a high metal-resistant Paenibacillus pabuli strain ALJ109b, isolated from high metal content mining residues, to reduce tellurite ion, and to evaluate the formation of metallic tellurium by cellular reduction, isolate the protein responsible, and determine the metabolic response to tellurite during growth. P. pabuli ALJ109b demonstrated to be resistant to Te (IV) at concentrations higher than reported for its genus. It can efficiently remove soluble Te (IV) from solution, over 20% in 8 h of growth, and reduce it to elemental Te, forming monodisperse nanostructures, verified by scattering electron microscopy. Cultivation of P. pabuli ALJ109b in the presence of Te (IV) affected the general protein expression pattern, and hence the metabolism, as demonstrated by high-throughput proteomic analysis. The Te (IV)-induced metabolic shift is characterized by an activation of ROS response. Flagellin from P. pabuli ALJ109b demonstrates high Te (0) forming activity in neutral to basic conditions in a range of temperatures from 20degreesC to 37degreesC. In conclusion, the first metabolic characterization of a strain of P. pabuli response to Te (IV) reveals a highly resistant strain with a unique Te (IV) proteomic response. This strain, and its flagellin, display, all the features of potential tools for Te nanoparticle production.
PXD019646	34558777	A phosphatase-centric mechanism drives stress signaling response. 	Endosulfines Igo1 and Igo2 promote hyperosmotic stress signaling via inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A	Cdc55, Endosulfines, Gis1, Hyperosmotic stress, Igo1, Igo2, PP2A, Phosphorylation, Quantitative Proteomics, Rph1, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Stress response, Stress signaling, phosphatase	Changing environmental cues lead to the adjustment of cellular physiology by phosphorylation signaling networks that typically center around kinases as active effectors and phosphatases as antagonistic elements. Here, we report a signaling mechanism that reverses this principle. Using the hyperosmotic stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, we find that a phosphatase-driven mechanism causes induction of phosphorylation. The key activating step that triggers this phospho-proteomic response is the Endosulfine-mediated inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A-Cdc55 (PP2A(Cdc55) ), while we do not observe concurrent kinase activation. In fact, many of the stress-induced phosphorylation sites appear to be direct substrates of the phosphatase, rendering PP2A(Cdc55) the main downstream effector of a signaling response that operates in parallel and independent of the well-established kinase-centric stress signaling pathways. This response affects multiple cellular processes and is required for stress survival. Our results demonstrate how a phosphatase can assume the role of active downstream effectors during signaling and allow re-evaluating the impact of phosphatases on shaping the phosphorylome.
PXD027623	34559566	Multistep mechanism of G-quadruplex resolution during DNA replication. 	Multistep mechanism of G-quadruplex resolution during DNA replication	DHX36, DNA replication, FANCJ, G-quadruplex, G4, G4 resolution, helicases	G-quadruplex (or G4) structures form in guanine-rich DNA sequences and threaten genome stability when not properly resolved. G4 unwinding occurs during S phase via an unknown mechanism. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we define a three-step G4 unwinding mechanism that acts during DNA replication. First, the replicative helicase composed of Cdc45, MCM2-7 and GINS (CMG) stalls at a leading strand G4 structure. Second, the DEAH-box helicase 36 (DHX36) mediates bypass of the CMG past the intact G4 structure, allowing approach of the leading strand to the G4. Third, G4 structure unwinding by the Fanconi anemia complementation group J helicase (FANCJ) enables DNA polymerase to synthesize past the G4 motif. A G4 on the lagging strand template does not stall CMG but still requires DNA replication for unwinding. DHX36 and FANCJ have partially redundant roles, conferring pathway robustness. This previously unknown genome maintenance pathway promotes faithful G4 replication, thereby avoiding genome instability.
PXD025018	34559986	ERalpha is an RNA-binding protein sustaining tumor cell survival and drug resistance. 	Mass spectrometry analysis of estrogen receptor alpha -interacting proteins.	Estrogen receptor, TMT, immunoprecipitation, mRNA binding	Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is a hormone receptor and key driver for over 70% of breast cancers that has been studied for decades as a transcription factor. Unexpectedly, we discover that ERalpha is a potent non-canonical RNA-binding protein. We show that ERalpha RNA binding function is uncoupled from its activity to bind DNA and critical for breast cancer progression. Employing genome-wide cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) sequencing and a functional CRISPRi screen, we find that ERalpha-associated mRNAs sustain cancer cell fitness and elicit cellular responses to stress. Mechanistically, ERalpha controls different steps of RNA metabolism. In particular, we demonstrate that ERalpha RNA binding mediates alternative splicing of XBP1 and translation of the eIF4G2 and MCL1 mRNAs, which facilitates survival upon stress conditions and sustains tamoxifen resistance of cancer cells. ERalpha is therefore a multifaceted RNA-binding protein, and this activity transforms our knowledge of post-transcriptional regulation underlying cancer development and drug response.
PXD027109	34560099	Mitochondrial respiratory chain function promotes extracellular matrix integrity in cartilage. 	Single cell RNA-seq analysis links respiratory dysfunction to an extracellular matrix-specific damage response	ECM, cartilage, respiration	Energy metabolism and extracellular matrix (ECM) function together orchestrate and maintain tissue organization, but crosstalk between these processes is poorly understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis to uncover the importance of the mitochondrial respiratory chain for ECM homeostasis in mature cartilage. This tissue produces large amounts of a specialized ECM to promote skeletal growth during development and maintain mobility throughout life. A combined approach of high-resolution scRNA-Seq, mass spectrometry/matrisome analysis, and atomic force microscopy was applied to mutant mice with cartilage-specific inactivation of respiratory chain function. This genetic inhibition in cartilage results in the expansion of a central area of 1-month-old mouse femur head cartilage, showing disorganized chondrocytes and increased deposition of ECM material. scRNA-Seq analysis identified a cell cluster-specific decrease in mitochondrial DNA-encoded respiratory chain genes and a unique regulation of ECM-related genes in nonarticular chondrocytes. These changes were associated with alterations in ECM composition, a shift in collagen/noncollagen protein content, and an increase of collagen crosslinking and ECM stiffness. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction is a key factor that can promote ECM integrity and mechanostability in cartilage and presumably also in many other tissues.
PXD026409	34560900	MEST promotes lung cancer invasion and metastasis by interacting with VCP to activate NF-kappaB signaling. 	MEST Promotes Lung Cancer Invasion and Metastasis by Interacting with VCP to Activate NF-ÎºB Signaling	Lung cancer, MEST, Metastasis, NF-ÎºB, VCP	BACKGROUND: Cell invasion is a hallmark of metastatic cancer, leading to unfavorable clinical outcomes. In this study, we established two highly invasive lung cancer cell models (A549-i8 and H1299-i8) and identified mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST) as a novel invasive regulator of lung cancer. We aim to characterize its biological function and clinical significance in lung cancer metastasis. METHODS: Transwell invasion assay was performed to establish high-invasive lung cancer cell model. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect MEST expression in tumor tissues. Mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analyses were used to identify MEST-regulated proteins and binding partners. Co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed to detect the interaction of MEST and VCP. The biological functions of MEST were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted to explore the colocalization of MEST and VCP. RESULTS: MEST overexpression promoted metastasis of lung cancer cells in vivo and in vitro by activating NF-kappaB signaling. MEST increased the interaction between VCP and IkappaBalpha, which accelerated IkappaBalpha degradation and NF-kappaB activation. Such acceleration was abrogated by VCP silencing, indicating that MEST is an upstream activator of the VCP/IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Furthermore, high expressions of MEST and VCP were associated with poor survival of lung cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results demonstrate that MEST plays an important role in driving invasion and metastasis of lung cancer by interacting with VCP to coordinate the IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB pathway. Targeting the MEST/VCP/IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB signaling pathway may be a promising strategy to treat lung cancer.
PXD023912	34561272	TGFBI Production by Macrophages Contributes to an Immunosuppressive Microenvironment in Ovarian Cancer. 	ECM-enriched proteomics of human fallopian tube, fimbria and ovarian tissue	ECM, TGFBI, fallopian tube, fimbria, ovarian cancer, ovary	The tumor microenvironment evolves during malignant progression, with major changes in nonmalignant cells, cytokine networks, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). In this study, we aimed to understand how the ECM changes during neoplastic transformation of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma lesions (STIC) into high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC). Analysis of the mechanical properties of human fallopian tubes (FT) and ovaries revealed that normal FT and fimbria had a lower tissue modulus, a measure of stiffness, than normal or diseased ovaries. Proteomic analysis of the matrisome fraction between FT, fimbria, and ovaries showed significant differences in the ECM protein TGF beta induced (TGFBI, also known as betaig-h3). STIC lesions in the fimbria expressed high levels of TGFBI, which was predominantly produced by CD163-positive macrophages proximal to STIC epithelial cells. In vitro stimulation of macrophages with TGFbeta and IL4 induced secretion of TGFBI, whereas IFNgamma/LPS downregulated macrophage TGFBI expression. Immortalized FT secretory epithelial cells carrying clinically relevant TP53 mutations stimulated macrophages to secrete TGFBI and upregulated integrin alphavbeta3, a putative TGFBI receptor. Transcriptomic HGSOC datasets showed a significant correlation between TGFBI expression and alternatively activated macrophage signatures. Fibroblasts in HGSOC metastases expressed TGFBI and stimulated macrophage TGFBI production in vitro. Treatment of orthotopic mouse HGSOC tumors with an anti-TGFBI antibody reduced peritoneal tumor size, increased tumor monocytes, and activated beta3-expressing unconventional T cells. In conclusion, TGFBI may favor an immunosuppressive microenvironment in STICs that persists in advanced HGSOC. Furthermore, TGFBI may be an effector of the tumor-promoting actions of TGFbeta and a potential therapeutic target. SIGNIFICANCE: Analysis of ECM changes during neoplastic transformation reveals a role for TGFBI secreted by macrophages in immunosuppression in early ovarian cancer.
PXD022707	34562372	Oncogene-dependent sloppiness in mRNA translation. 	Oncogene-dependent sloppiness in mRNA translation	cancer, immunoprecipitation, ribosomal frameshifting, translation, tryptophan depletion	mRNA translation is a highly conserved and tightly controlled mechanism for protein synthesis. Despite protein quality control mechanisms, amino acid shortage in melanoma induces aberrant proteins by ribosomal frameshifting. The extent and the underlying mechanisms related to this phenomenon are yet unknown. Here, we show that tryptophan depletion-induced ribosomal frameshifting is a widespread phenomenon in cancer. We termed this event sloppiness and strikingly observed its association with MAPK pathway hyperactivation. Sloppiness is stimulated by RAS activation in primary cells, suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of the oncogenic MAPK pathway in sloppy cells, and restored in cells with acquired resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition. Interestingly, sloppiness causes aberrant peptide presentation at the cell surface, allowing recognition and specific killing of drug-resistant cancer cells by T lymphocytes. Thus, while oncogenes empower cancer progression and aggressiveness, they also expose a vulnerability by provoking the production of aberrant peptides through sloppiness.
PXD026352	34562454	DNA-PKcs kinase activity stabilizes the transcription factor Egr1 in activated immune cells. 	DNA-PKcs kinase activity stabilizes the transcription factor Egr1 in activated immune cells	MS3, Phospo, TMT	DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is known primarily for its function in DNA double-stranded break repair and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). However, DNA-PKcs also has a critical yet undefined role in immunity impacting both myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages spurring interest in targeting DNA-PKcs for therapeutic strategies in immune-related diseases. To gain insight into the function of DNA-PKcs within immune cells, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic screen in T cells to identify phosphorylation targets of DNA-PKcs. Our results indicate that DNA-PKcs phosphorylates the transcription factor Egr1 (early growth response protein 1) at serine 301. Expression of Egr1 is induced early upon T cell activation and dictates T cell response by modulating expression of cytokines and key costimulatory molecules such as IL (interleukin) 2, IL6, IFNgamma, and NFkappaB. Inhibition of DNA-PKcs by treatment with a DNA-PKcs specific inhibitor NU7441 or shRNA knockdown increased proteasomal degradation of Egr1. Mutation of serine 301 to alanine via CRISPR-Cas9 reduced EGR1 protein expression and decreased Egr1-dependent transcription of IL2 in activated T cells. Our findings identify DNA-PKcs as a critical intermediary link between T cell activation and T cell fate and a novel phosphosite involved in regulating Egr1 activity.
PXD019360	34562649	Oxidative Modifications Switch Modulatory Activities of Urinary Proteins From Inhibiting to Promoting Calcium Oxalate Crystallization, Growth, and Aggregation. 	Oxidative modifications of urinary proteins increase kidney stone risk	Calcium oxalate, Kidney stone, Oxidative stress, Post-translation modification, Uromodulin	The incidence/prevalence of kidney stone disease has been increasing around the globe, but its pathogenic mechanisms remained unclear. We evaluated effects of oxidative modifications of urinary proteins on calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone formation processes. Urinary proteins derived from 20 healthy individuals were modified by performic oxidation, and the presence of oxidatively modified urinary proteins was verified, quantified, and characterized by Oxyblot assay and tandem MS (nanoLC-electrospray ionization-linear trap quadrupole-Orbitrap-MS/MS). Subsequently, activities of oxidatively modified urinary proteins on CaOx stone formation processes were examined. Oxyblot assay confirmed the marked increase in protein oxidation level in the modified urine. NanoLC-electrospray ionization-linear trap quadrupole-Orbitrap-MS/MS identified a total of 193 and 220 urinary proteins in nonmodified and modified urine samples, respectively. Among these, there were 1121 and 5297 unambiguous oxidatively modified peptides representing 42 and 136 oxidatively modified proteins in the nonmodified and modified urine samples, respectively. Crystal assays revealed that oxidatively modified urinary proteins significantly promoted CaOx crystallization, crystal growth, and aggregation. By contrast, the nonmodified urinary proteins had inhibitory activities. This is the first direct evidence demonstrating that oxidative modifications of urinary proteins increase the risk of kidney stone disease by switching their modulatory activities from inhibiting to promoting CaOx crystallization, crystal growth, and aggregation.
PXD026643	34562664	Salt stress downregulates 2-hydroxybutyrylation in Arabidopsis siliques. 	Salt-inhibited protein 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation affects silique development of Arabidopsis thaliana	Arabidopsis thaliana. Silique. Lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation. Salt stress	Lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (Khib) is one of the newly discovered post-translational modifications (PTMs) through protein acylation. It has been reported to be widely distributed in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and plays an important role in chromatin conformation change, gene transcription, protein subcellular localization, protein-protein interaction, signal transduction, and cellular proliferation. In this study, the Khib modification proteome of siliques from A. thaliana under salt stress (Ss) and those in the control (Cs) were compared. The results showed that Khib modification was abundant in siliques. Totally 3810 normalized Khib sites on 1254 proteins were identified, and the Khib modification showed a downregulation trend dramatically: it was down-regulated at 282 sites on 205 proteins while was up-regulated at 96 sites on 78 proteins in Ss siliques (Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD028116 and PXD026643). Among them, 13 proteins, including F4IVN6, Q9M1P5, and Q9LF33, had sites with the most significant regulation of Khib modification. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the differentially Khib-regulated proteins mainly participated in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and endocytosis. In particular, there were differentially117 Khib-regulated proteins that were mapped to the protein-protein interaction database. In the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Khib-modified proteins were enriched in several pathways related to energy metabolism, including gluconeogenesis pathway, pentose phosphate pathway, and pyruvate metabolism. Overall, our work reveals the first systematic analysis of Khib proteome in Arabidopsis siliques under salt stress, and sheds a light on the future studies on the regulatory mechanisms of Khib during the salt stress response of plants. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we found the Khib-modified proteins in silique under salt stress and described the enrichment of Khib-modified proteins involved in the biological processes and cellular localization. Proteins undergoing 2-hydroxyisobutylation were mainly involved in the gluconeogenesis pathway, pentose phosphate pathway, and pyruvate metabolism, suggesting that 2-hydroxyisobutylation affects the energy metabolic pathway, and thus the development of the plant. In addition, specific candidate proteins that may affect plant development under salt stress were selected. This study will provide a theoretical basis for revealing the function and mechanism of these proteins and their 2-hydroxyisobutyryl modifications during the development of silique under salt stress.
PXD023163	34566949	Systems-Level Proteomics Evaluation of Microglia Response to Tumor-Supportive Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines. 	Proteomic analysis of human microglia cells (HMC3) stimulated with anti-inflammatory cytokines using serum-deprived culture conditions	HMC3, Microglia, cytokines, tumor	Background: Microglia safeguard the CNS against injuries and pathogens, and in the presence of certain harmful stimuli are capable of inducing a disease-dependent inflammatory response. When exposed to anti-inflammatory cytokines, however, these cells possess the ability to switch from an inflammatory to an immunosuppressive phenotype. Cancer cells exploit this property to evade the immune system, and elicit an anti-inflammatory microenvironment that facilitates tumor attachment and growth. Objective: The tumor-supportive biological processes that are activated in microglia cells in response to anti-inflammatory cytokines released from cancer cells were explored with mass spectrometry and proteomic technologies. Methods: Serum-depleted and non-depleted human microglia cells (HMC3) were treated with a cocktail of IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, TGFbeta, and CCL2. The cellular protein extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Using functional annotation clustering tools, statistically significant proteins that displayed a change in abundance between cytokine-treated and non-treated cells were mapped to their biological networks and pathways. Results: The proteomic analysis of HMC3 cells enabled the identification of ~10,000 proteins. Stimulation with anti-inflammatory cytokines resulted in the activation of distinct, yet integrated clusters of proteins that trigger downstream a number of tumor-promoting biological processes. The observed changes could be classified into four major categories, i.e., mitochondrial gene expression, ECM remodeling, immune response, and impaired cell cycle progression. Intracellular immune activation was mediated mainly by the transducers of MAPK, STAT, TGFbeta, NFKB, and integrin signaling pathways. Abundant collagen formation along with the expression of additional receptors, matrix components, growth factors, proteases and protease inhibitors, was indicative of ECM remodeling processes supportive of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. Overexpression of integrins and their modulators was reflective of signaling processes that link ECM reorganization with cytoskeletal re-arrangements supportive of cell migration. Antigen processing/presentation was represented by HLA class I histocompatibility antigens, and correlated with upregulated proteasomal subunits, vesicular/viral transport, and secretory processes. Immunosuppressive and proangiogenic chemokines, as well as anti-angiogenic factors, were detectable in low abundance. Pronounced pro-inflammatory, chemotactic or phagocytic trends were not observed, however, the expression of certain receptors, signaling and ECM proteins indicated the presence of such capabilities. Conclusions: Comprehensive proteomic profiling of HMC3 cells stimulated with anti-inflammatory cytokines revealed a spectrum of microglia phenotypes supportive of cancer development in the brain via microenvironment-dependent biological mechanisms.
PXD024549	34566994	Characterization by Quantitative Serum Proteomics of Immune-Related Prognostic Biomarkers for COVID-19 Symptomatology. 	Serum quantitative proteomics identifies prognostic biomarkers and physiological processes related to COVID-19 symptomatology	COVID-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SWATH-MS, human serum	The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 challenges the understanding of factors affecting disease progression and severity. The identification of prognostic biomarkers and physiological processes associated with disease symptoms is relevant for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to contribute to the control of this pandemic. To address this challenge, in this study, we used a quantitative proteomics together with multiple data analysis algorithms to characterize serum protein profiles in five cohorts from healthy to SARS-CoV-2-infected recovered (hospital discharge), nonsevere (hospitalized), and severe [at the intensive care unit (ICU)] cases with increasing systemic inflammation in comparison with healthy individuals sampled prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed significantly dysregulated proteins and associated biological processes and disorders associated to COVID-19. These results corroborated previous findings in COVID-19 studies and highlighted how the representation of dysregulated serum proteins and associated BPs increases with COVID-19 disease symptomatology from asymptomatic to severe cases. The analysis was then focused on novel disease processes and biomarkers that were correlated with disease symptomatology. To contribute to translational medicine, results corroborated the predictive value of selected immune-related biomarkers for disease recovery [Selenoprotein P (SELENOP) and Serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1)], severity [Carboxypeptidase B2 (CBP2)], and symptomatology [Pregnancy zone protein (PZP)] using protein-specific ELISA tests. Our results contributed to the characterization of SARS-CoV-2-host molecular interactions with potential contributions to the monitoring and control of this pandemic by using immune-related biomarkers associated with disease symptomatology.
PXD026740	34568381	Capturing Salmonella SspH2 Host Targets in Virus-Like Particles. 	Capturing Salmonella SspH2 Host Targets in Virus-Like Particles	Salmonella, SspH2, Virotrap, effector	In the context of host-pathogen interactions, gram-negative bacterial virulence factors, such as effectors, may be transferred from bacterial to eukaryotic host cytoplasm by multicomponent Type III protein secretion systems (T3SSs). Central to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) pathogenesis is the secretion of over 40 effectors by two T3SSs encoded within pathogenicity islands SPI-1 and SPI-2. These effectors manipulate miscellaneous host cellular processes, such as cytoskeleton organization and immune signaling pathways, thereby permitting host colonization and bacterial dissemination. Recent research on effector biology provided mechanistic insights for some effectors. However, for many effectors, clearly defined roles and host target repertoires-further clarifying effector interconnectivity and virulence networks-are yet to be uncovered. Here we demonstrate the utility of the recently described viral-like particle trapping technology Virotrap as an effective approach to catalog S. Typhimurium effector-host protein complexes (EH-PCs). Mass spectrometry-based Virotrap analysis of the novel E3 ubiquitin ligase SspH2 previously shown to be implicated in modulating actin dynamics and immune signaling, exposed known host interactors PFN1 and-2 besides several putative novel, interconnected host targets. Network analysis revealed an actin (-binding) cluster among the significantly enriched hits for SspH2, consistent with the known localization of the S-palmitoylated effector with actin cytoskeleton components in the host. We show that Virotrap complements the current state-of-the-art toolkit to study protein complexes and represents a valuable means to screen for effector host targets in a high-throughput manner, thereby bridging the knowledge gap between effector-host interplay and pathogenesis.
PXD023137	34568836	Distinct CDK6 complexes determine tumor cell response to CDK4/6 inhibitors and degraders. 	Distinct CDK6 complexes determine tumor cell response to CDK4/6 inhibitors and degraders	CDK4/6 inhibitors and degraders, CDK6 complex, tumor	CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) are effective in metastatic breast cancer, but they have been only modestly effective in most other tumor types. Here we show that tumors expressing low CDK6 rely on CDK4 function, and are exquisitely sensitive to CDK4/6i. In contrast, tumor cells expressing both CDK4 and CDK6 have increased reliance on CDK6 to ensure cell cycle progression. We discovered that CDK4/6i and CDK4/6 degraders potently bind and inhibit CDK6 selectively in tumors in which CDK6 is highly thermo-unstable and strongly associated with the HSP90/CDC37 complex. In contrast, CDK4/6i and CDK4/6 degraders are ineffective in antagonizing tumor cells expressing thermostable CDK6, due to their weaker binding to CDK6 in these cells. Thus, we uncover a general mechanism of intrinsic resistance to CDK4/6i and CDK4/6i-derived degraders and the need for novel inhibitors targeting the CDK4/6i-resistant, thermostable form of CDK6 for application as cancer therapeutics.
PXD026939	34569154	A highly multiplexed quantitative phosphosite assay for biology and preclinical studies. 	Highly multiplexed quantitative phosphosite assay for biology and preclinical studies	CPTAC, breast cancer, medulloblastoma, multiple reaction monitoring, post-translational modifications, selected reaction monitoring, targeted mass spectrometry	Reliable methods to quantify dynamic signaling changes across diverse pathways are needed to better understand the effects of disease and drug treatment in cells and tissues but are presently lacking. Here, we present SigPath, a targeted mass spectrometry (MS) assay that measures 284 phosphosites in 200 phosphoproteins of biological interest. SigPath probes a broad swath of signaling biology with high throughput and quantitative precision. We applied the assay to investigate changes in phospho-signaling in drug-treated cancer cell lines, breast cancer preclinical models, and human medulloblastoma tumors. In addition to validating previous findings, SigPath detected and quantified a large number of differentially regulated phosphosites newly associated with disease models and human tumors at baseline or with drug perturbation. Our results highlight the potential of SigPath to monitor phosphoproteomic signaling events and to nominate mechanistic hypotheses regarding oncogenesis, response, and resistance to therapy.
PXD024217	34569252	Circulating extracellular vesicles of patients with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome have higher RAC1 and induce recapitulation of nephrotic syndrome phenotype in podocytes. 	Characterization of circulating extracellular vesides of steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome patients	extracellular vesides, nephrotic syndrome	Since previous research suggests a role of a circulating factor in the pathogenesis of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (NS), we speculated that circulating plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a candidate source of such a soluble mediator. Here, we aimed to characterize and try to delineate the effects of these EVs in vitro. Plasma EVs from 20 children with steroid-sensitive NS in relapse and remission, 10 healthy controls, and 6 disease controls were obtained by serial ultracentrifugation. Characterization of these EVs was performed by electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis. Major proteins from plasma EVs were identified via mass spectrometry. Gene Ontology classification analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis were performed on selectively expressed EV proteins during relapse. Immortalized human podocyte culture was used to detect the effects of EVs on podocytes. The protein content and particle number of plasma EVs were significantly increased during NS relapse. Relapse NS EVs selectively expressed proteins that involved actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Among these, the level of RAC-GTP was significantly increased in relapse EVs compared with remission and disease control EVs. Relapse EVs were efficiently internalized by podocytes and induced significantly enhanced motility and albumin permeability. Moreover, relapse EVs induced significantly higher levels of RAC-GTP and phospho-p38 and decreased the levels of synaptopodin in podocytes. Circulating relapse EVs are biologically active molecules that carry active RAC1 as cargo and induce recapitulation of the NS phenotype in podocytes in vitro.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Up to now, the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the pathogenesis of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (NS) has not been studied. Here, we found that relapse NS EVs contain significantly increased active RAC1, induce enhanced podocyte motility, and increase expression of RAC-GTP and phospho-p38 expression in vitro. These results suggest that plasma EVs are biologically active molecules in the pathogenesis of NS.
PXD027337	34569643	A regulatory phosphorylation site on Mec1 controls chromatin occupancy of RNA polymerases during replication stress. 	Regulatory phosphosite on Mec1 and control of RNAP11 and PIII during replication stress	Mec1, chromatome, phosphoproteomics, replication stress	Upon replication stress, budding yeast checkpoint kinase Mec1(ATR) triggers the downregulation of transcription, thereby reducing the level of RNA polymerase (RNAP) on chromatin to facilitate replication fork progression. Here, we identify a hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation site on Mec1, Mec1-S1991, that contributes to the eviction of RNAPII and RNAPIII during replication stress. The expression of the non-phosphorylatable mec1-S1991A mutant reduces replication fork progression genome-wide and compromises survival on hydroxyurea. This defect can be suppressed by destabilizing chromatin-bound RNAPII through a TAP fusion to its Rpb3 subunit, suggesting that lethality in mec1-S1991A mutants arises from replication-transcription conflicts. Coincident with a failure to repress gene expression on hydroxyurea in mec1-S1991A cells, highly transcribed genes such as GAL1 remain bound at nuclear pores. Consistently, we find that nuclear pore proteins and factors controlling RNAPII and RNAPIII are phosphorylated in a Mec1-dependent manner on hydroxyurea. Moreover, we show that Mec1 kinase also contributes to reduced RNAPII occupancy on chromatin during an unperturbed S phase by promoting degradation of the Rpb1 subunit.
PXD028134	34570240	Fusarium BP1 is a reader of H3K27 methylation. 	Identification of PRC2 complex interactor	Flag, GFP	Histone H3 lysine 27 methylation catalyzed by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is conserved from fungi to humans and represses gene transcription. However, the mechanism for recognition of methylated H3K27 remains unclear, especially in fungi. Here, we found that the bromo-adjacent homology (BAH)-plant homeodomain (PHD) domain containing protein BAH-PHD protein 1 (BP1) is a reader of H3K27 methylation in the cereal fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum. BP1 interacts with the core PRC2 component Suz12 and directly binds methylated H3K27. BP1 is distributed in a subset of genomic regions marked by H3K27me3 and co-represses gene transcription. The BP1 deletion mutant shows identical phenotypes on mycelial growth and virulence, as well as similar expression profiles of secondary metabolite genes to the strain lacking the H3K27 methyltransferase Kmt6. More importantly, BP1 can directly bind DNA through its PHD finger, which might increase nucleosome residence and subsequently reinforce transcriptional repression in H3K27me3-marked target regions. A phylogenetic analysis showed that BP1 orthologs are mainly conserved in fungi. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the mechanism by which PRC2 mediates gene repression in fungi, which is distinct from the PRC1-PRC2 system in plants and mammals.
PXD025027	34570885	The megakaryocytic transcription factor ARID3A suppresses leukemia pathogenesis. 	CMK LC-MS/MS after CoIP of ARID3A	ARID3A, CMK, ML-DS	Given the plasticity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, multiple routes of differentiation must be blocked in the the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia, the molecular basis of which is incompletely understood. We report that posttranscriptional repression of the transcription factor ARID3A by miR-125b is a key event in the pathogenesis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). AMKL is frequently associated with trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutations (GATA1s), and children with Down syndrome are at a high risk of developing the disease. The results of our study showed that chromosome 21-encoded miR-125b synergizes with Gata1s to drive leukemogenesis in this context. Leveraging forward and reverse genetics, we uncovered Arid3a as the main miR-125b target behind this synergy. We demonstrated that, during normal hematopoiesis, this transcription factor promotes megakaryocytic differentiation in concert with GATA1 and mediates TGFbeta-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in complex with SMAD2/3. Although Gata1s mutations perturb erythroid differentiation and induce hyperproliferation of megakaryocytic progenitors, intact ARID3A expression assures their megakaryocytic differentiation and growth restriction. Upon knockdown, these tumor suppressive functions are revoked, causing a blockade of dual megakaryocytic/erythroid differentiation and subsequently of AMKL. Inversely, restoring ARID3A expression relieves the arrest of megakaryocytic differentiation in AMKL patient-derived xenografts. This work illustrates how mutations in lineage-determining transcription factors and perturbation of posttranscriptional gene regulation can interact to block multiple routes of hematopoietic differentiation and cause leukemia. In AMKL, surmounting this differentiation blockade through restoration of the tumor suppressor ARID3A represents a promising strategy for treating this lethal pediatric disease.
PXD026794	34570971	A Quantitative Proteomic Approach for the Identification of DNA Guanine Quadruplex-Binding Proteins. 	Proteome-wide Identification of DNA Guanine Quadruplex-binding Proteins	G-quadruplex, SILAC	DNA sequences of high guanine (G) content have the potential to form G quadruplex (G4) structures. A more complete understanding about the biological functions of G4 DNA requires the investigation about how these structures are recognized by proteins. Here, we conducted exhaustive quantitative proteomic experiments to profile the interaction proteomes of G4 structures by employing different sequences of G4 DNA derived from the human telomere and the promoters of c-MYC and c-KIT genes. Our results led to the identification of a number of candidate G4-interacting proteins, many of which were discovered here for the first time. These included three proteins that can bind to all three DNA G4 structures and 78 other proteins that can bind selectively to one or two of the three DNA G4 structure(s). We also validated that GRSF1 can bind directly and selectively toward G4 structure derived from the c-MYC promoter. Our quantitative proteomic screening also led to the identification of a number of candidate "antireader" proteins of G4 DNA. Together, we uncovered a number of cellular proteins that exhibit general and selective recognitions of G4 folding patterns, which underscore the complexity of G4 DNA in biology and the importance of understanding fully the G4-interaction proteome.
PXD025587	34571008	Quantitative proteomics identifies the universally conserved ATPase Ola1p as a positive regulator of heat shock response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 	Quantitative proteomics identifies Ola1p as a positive regulator of heat shock response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Saccharomyces cerevisiae, depletome, heat shock response, native SILAC	The universally conserved P-loop ATPase Ola1 is implicated in various cellular stress response pathways, as well as in cancer and tumor progression. However, Ola1p functions are divergent between species, and the involved mechanisms are only poorly understood. Here, we studied the role of Ola1p in the heat shock response of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of quantitative and pulse labeling-based proteomics approaches, in vitro studies, and cell-based assays. Our data show that when heat stress is applied to cells lacking Ola1p, the expression of stress-protective proteins is enhanced. During heat stress Ola1p associates with detergent-resistant protein aggregates and rapidly forms assemblies that localize to stress granules. The assembly of Ola1p was also observed in vitro using purified protein and conditions, which resembled those in living cells. We show that loss of Ola1p results in increased protein ubiquitination of detergent-insoluble aggregates recovered from heat-shocked cells. When cells lacking Ola1p were subsequently relieved from heat stress, reinitiation of translation was delayed, whereas, at the same time, de novo synthesis of central factors required for protein refolding and the clearance of aggregates was enhanced when compared with wild-type cells. The combined data suggest that upon acute heat stress, Ola1p is involved in the stabilization of misfolded proteins, which become sequestered in cytoplasmic stress granules. This function of Ola1p enables cells to resume translation in a timely manner as soon as heat stress is relieved.
PXD026380	34571830	Proteomic Analysis of Estrogen-Mediated Enhancement of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Induced Angiogenesis In Vivo. 	Proteomic Analysis of Estrogen Mediated Enhancement of MSC-Induced Angiogenesis in vivo	MSC, angiogeneis	Therapeutic use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for tissue repair has great potential. MSCs from multiple sources, including those derived from human umbilical matrix, namely Wharton's jelly, may serve as a resource for obtaining MSCs. However, low in vivo engraftment efficacy of MSCs remains a challenging limitation. To improve clinical outcomes using MSCs, an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms and factors involved in successful engraftment is required. We recently demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol (E2) improves MSCs in vitro proliferation, directed migration and engraftment in murine heart slices. Here, using a proteomics approach, we investigated the angiogenic potential of MSCs in vivo and the modulatory actions of E2 on mechanisms involved in tissue repair. Specifically, using a Matrigel((R)) plug assay, we evaluated the effects of E2 on MSCs-induced angiogenesis in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. Moreover, using proteomics we investigated the potential pro-repair processes, pathways, and co-mechanisms possibly modified by the treatment of MSCs with E2. Using RT-qPCR, we evaluated mRNA expression of pro-angiogenic molecules, including endoglin, Tie-2, ANG, and VEGF. Hemoglobin levels, a marker for blood vessel formation, were increased in plugs treated with E2 + MSCs, suggesting increased capillary formation. This conclusion was confirmed by the histological analysis of capillary numbers in the Matrigel((R)) plugs treated with E2 + MSC. The LC-MS screening of proteins obtained from the excised Matrigel((R)) plugs revealed 71 proteins that were significantly altered following E2 exposure, 57 up-regulated proteins and 14 down-regulated proteins. A major result was the association of over 100 microRNA molecules (miRNAs) involved in cellular communication, vesicle transport, and metabolic and energy processes, and the high percentage of approximately 25% of genes involved in unknown biological processes. Together, these data provide evidence for increased angiogenesis by MSCs treated with the sex hormone E2. In conclusion, E2 treatment may increase the engraftment and repair potential of MSCs into tissue, and may promote MSC-induced angiogenesis after tissue injury.
PXD026723	34571944	The Cell Wall Proteome of Craterostigma plantagineum Cell Cultures Habituated to Dichlobenil and Isoxaben. 	The cell wall proteome of Craterostigma plantagineum cell cultures habituated to dichlobenil and isoxaben	Craterostigma plantagineum, cell wall, dichlobenil, habituation, isoxaben, qPCR	The remarkable desiccation tolerance of the vegetative tissues in the resurrection species Craterostigma plantagineum (Hochst.) is favored by its unique cell wall folding mechanism that allows the ordered and reversible shrinking of the cells without damaging neither the cell wall nor the underlying plasma membrane. The ability to withstand extreme drought is also maintained in abscisic acid pre-treated calli, which can be cultured both on solid and in liquid culture media. Cell wall research has greatly advanced, thanks to the use of inhibitors affecting the biosynthesis of e.g., cellulose, since they allowed the identification of the compensatory mechanisms underlying habituation. Considering the innate cell wall plasticity of C. plantagineum, the goal of this investigation was to understand whether habituation to the cellulose biosynthesis inhibitors dichlobenil and isoxaben entailed or not identical mechanisms as known for non-resurrection species and to decipher the cell wall proteome of habituated cells. The results showed that exposure of C. plantagineum calli/cells triggered abnormal phenotypes, as reported in non-resurrection species. Additionally, the data demonstrated that it was possible to habituate Craterostigma cells to dichlobenil and isoxaben and that gene expression and protein abundance did not follow the same trend. Shotgun and gel-based proteomics revealed a common set of proteins induced upon habituation, but also identified candidates solely induced by habituation to one of the two inhibitors. Finally, it is hypothesized that alterations in auxin levels are responsible for the increased abundance of cell wall-related proteins upon habituation.
PXD027065	34572331	Transgelin Contributes to a Poor Response of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma to Sunitinib Treatment. 	Transgelin contributes to a poor response of metastatic renal cell carcinoma to sunitinib treatment	DIA-MS, mccRCC, resistance, sunitinib, transgelin	Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents about 2-3% of all cancers with over 400,000 new cases per year. Sunitinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, has been used mainly for first-line treatment of metastatic clear-cell RCC with good or intermediate prognosis. However, about one-third of metastatic RCC patients do not respond to sunitinib, leading to disease progression. Here, we aim to find and characterize proteins associated with poor sunitinib response in a pilot proteomics study. Sixteen RCC tumors from patients responding (8) vs. non-responding (8) to sunitinib 3 months after treatment initiation were analyzed using data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry, together with their adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Proteomics analysis quantified 1996 protein groups (FDR = 0.01) and revealed 27 proteins deregulated between tumors non-responding vs. responding to sunitinib, representing a pattern of deregulated proteins potentially contributing to sunitinib resistance. Gene set enrichment analysis showed an up-regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition with transgelin as one of the most significantly abundant proteins. Transgelin expression was silenced by CRISPR/Cas9 and RNA interference, and the cells with reduced transgelin level exhibited significantly slower proliferation. Our data indicate that transgelin is an essential protein supporting RCC cell proliferation, which could contribute to intrinsic sunitinib resistance.
PXD024132	34572333	Long Term Response to Circulating Angiogenic Cells, Unstimulated or Atherosclerotic Pre-Conditioned, in Critical Limb Ischemic Mice. 	Long-term changes following pre-conditioned circulating angiogenic cells therapy in critical limb ischemia	Circulating angiogenic cells, atherosclerotic secretome, critical limb ischemia, immune cells, neovascularization	Critical limb ischemia (CLI), the most severe form of peripheral artery disease, results from the blockade of peripheral vessels, usually correlated to atherosclerosis. Currently, endovascular and surgical revascularization strategies cannot be applied to all patients due to related comorbidities, and even so, most patients require re-intervention or amputation within a year. Circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) constitute a good alternative as CLI cell therapy due to their vascular regenerative potential, although the mechanisms of action of these cells, as well as their response to pathological conditions, remain unclear. Previously, we have shown that CACs enhance angiogenesis/arteriogenesis from the first days of administration in CLI mice. Also, the incubation ex vivo of these cells with factors secreted by atherosclerotic plaques promotes their activation and mobilization. Herein, we have evaluated the long-term effect of CACs administration in CLI mice, whether pre-stimulated or not with atherosclerotic factors. Remarkably, mice receiving CACs and moreover, pre-stimulated CACs, presented the highest blood flow recovery, lower progression of ischemic symptoms, and decrease of immune cells recruitment. In addition, many proteins potentially involved, like CD44 or matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), up-regulated in response to ischemia and decreased after CACs administration, were identified by a quantitative proteomics approach. Overall, our data suggest that pre-stimulation of CACs with atherosclerotic factors might potentiate the regenerative properties of these cells in vivo.
PXD026309	34572914	HMGB1 Protein Interactions in Prostate and Ovary Cancer Models Reveal Links to RNA Processing and Ribosome Biogenesis through NuRD, THOC and Septin Complexes. 	HMGB1 interactome in prostate and ovarian cancer cells treated with cisplatin	HMGB1, PC-3, SKOV-3, cisplatin, interactome, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer	This study reports the HMGB1 interactomes in prostate and ovary cancer cells lines. Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry confirmed that the HMGB1 nuclear interactome is involved in HMGB1 known functions such as maintenance of chromatin stability and regulation of transcription, and also in not as yet reported processes such as mRNA and rRNA processing. We have identified an interaction between HMGB1 and the NuRD complex and validated this by yeast-two-hybrid, confirming that the RBBP7 subunit directly interacts with HMGB1. In addition, we describe for the first time an interaction between two HMGB1 interacting complexes, the septin and THOC complexes, as well as an interaction of these two complexes with Rab11. Analysis of Pan-Cancer Atlas public data indicated that several genes encoding HMGB1-interacting proteins identified in this study are dysregulated in tumours from patients diagnosed with ovary and prostate carcinomas. In PC-3 cells, silencing of HMGB1 leads to downregulation of the expression of key regulators of ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing, namely BOP1, RSS1, UBF1, KRR1 and LYAR. Upregulation of these genes in prostate adenocarcinomas is correlated with worse prognosis, reinforcing their functional significance in cancer progression.
PXD022993	34573293	Substitutions in SurA and BamA Lead to Reduced Susceptibility to Broad Range Antibiotics in Gonococci. 	Quantitative proteomic analysis of the cell envelope and cytosolic fraction of drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae	Gonorrhea, Neisseria, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Periplasmic Chaperones, Resistance, Shotgun proteomics	There is growing concern about the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. To effectively control antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, it is necessary to develop new antimicrobials and to understand the resistance mechanisms to existing antibiotics. In this study, we discovered the unexpected onset of drug resistance in N. gonorrhoeae caused by amino acid substitutions in the periplasmic chaperone SurA and the beta-barrel assembly machinery component BamA. Here, we investigated the i19.05 clinical isolate with mutations in corresponding genes along with reduced susceptibility to penicillin, tetracycline, and azithromycin. The mutant strain NG05 (surA(mut) bamA(mut), and penA(mut)) was obtained using the pan-susceptible n01.08 clinical isolate as a recipient in the transformation procedure. Comparative proteomic analysis of NG05 and n01.08 strains revealed significantly increased levels of other chaperones, Skp and FkpA, and some transport proteins. Efflux pump inhibition experiments demonstrated that the reduction in sensitivity was achieved due to the activity of efflux pumps. We hypothesize that the described mutations in the surA and bamA genes cause the qualitative and quantitative changes of periplasmic chaperones, which in turn alters the function of synthesized cell envelope proteins.
PXD027132	34574245	Partial-, Double-Enzymatic Dephosphorylation and EndoGluC Hydrolysis as an Original Approach to Enhancing Identification of Casein Phosphopeptides (CPPs) by Mass Spectrometry. 	Casein phoshopeptides identification by partial-, double-dephosphorylation and endoGluC digestion	casein phosphopeptides, dephosphorylation, endoGluC digestion	The identification of phosphopeptides is currently a challenge when they are part of a complex matrix of peptides, such as a milk protein enzymatic hydrolysate. This challenge increases with both the number of phosphorylation sites on the phosphopeptides and their amino acid length. Here, this paper reports a four-phase strategy from an enzymatic casein hydrolysate before a mass spectrometry analysis in order to enhance the identification of phosphopeptides and phosphosites: (i) the control protein hydrolysate, (ii) a two-step enzymatic dephosphorylation of the latter, allowing for the almost total dephosphorylation of peptides, (iii) a one-step enzymatic dephosphorylation, allowing for the partial dephosphorylation of the peptides and (iv) an additional endoGluC enzymatic hydrolysis, allowing for the cleavage of long-size peptides into shorter ones. The reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC-MS/MS) analyses of hydrolysates that underwent this four-phase strategy allowed for the identification of 28 phosphorylation sites (90%) out of the 31 referenced in UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot (1 June 2021), compared to 17 sites (54%) without the latter. The alpha-S2 casein phosphosites, referenced by their similarity in the UniProt database, were experimentally identified, whereas pSer148, pThr166 and pSer187 from a multiphosphorylated long-size kappa-casein were not. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027132.
PXD026965	34575131	Narrow Precursor Mass Range for DIA-MS Enhances Protein Identification and Quantification in Arabidopsis. 	Narrow precursor window for DIA-MS enhances protein identification and quantification	Data independent acqusition (DIA)	Data independent acquisition-mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) is becoming widely utilised for robust and accurate quantification of samples in quantitative proteomics. Here, we describe the systematic evaluation of the effects of DIA precursor mass range on total protein identification and quantification. We show that a narrow mass range of precursors (~250 m/z) for DIA-MS enables a higher number of protein identifications. Subsequent application of DIA with narrow precursor range (from 400 to 650 m/z) on an Arabidopsis sample with spike-in known proteins identified 34.7% more proteins than in conventional DIA (cDIA) with a wide precursor range of 400-1200 m/z. When combining several DIA-MS analyses with narrow precursor ranges (i.e., 400-650, 650-900 and 900-1200 m/z), we were able to quantify 10,099 protein groups with a median coefficient of variation of <6%. These findings represent a 54.7% increase in the number of proteins quantified than with cDIA analysis. This is particularly important for low abundance proteins, as exemplified by the six-protein mix spike-in. In cDIA only five out of the six-protein mix were quantified while our approach allowed accurate quantitation of all six proteins.
PXD017972	34575877	Early Embryo Exposure to Assisted Reproductive Manipulation Induced Subtle Changes in Liver Epigenetics with No Apparent Negative Health Consequences in Rabbit. 	Transgenerational long-term effects of the embryo cryopreservation-transfer procedure: a multi-omic approach	SWATH, cryopreserved embryo, transgenerational effects	Embryo manipulation is a requisite step in assisted reproductive technology (ART). Therefore, it is of great necessity to appraise the safety of ART and investigate the long-term effect, including lipid metabolism, on ART-conceived offspring. Augmenting our ART rabbit model to investigate lipid metabolic outcomes in offspring longitudinally, we detected variations in hepatic DNA methylation ART offspring in the F3 generation for embryonic exposure (multiple ovulation, vitrification and embryo transfer). Through adult liver metabolomics and proteomics, we identified changes mainly related to lipid metabolism (e.g., polyunsaturated fatty acids, steroids, steroid hormone). We also found that DNA methylation analysis was linked to changes in lipid metabolism and apoptosis genes. Nevertheless, these differences did not apparently alter the general health status. Thus, our findings suggest that ART is likely to be a player in embryo epigenetic events related to hepatic homeostasis alteration in adulthood.
PXD027923	34576018	Impact of DICER1 and DROSHA on the Angiogenic Capacity of Human Endothelial Cells. 	Analysis of the impact of DICER1 and DROSHA on the angio-genic capacity of human endothelial cells	DICER1, DROSHA, Endothelial cells, RNA interference, angiogenesis, microRNA biogenesis	RNAi-mediated knockdown of DICER1 and DROSHA, enzymes critically involved in miRNA biogenesis, has been postulated to affect the homeostasis and the angiogenic capacity of human endothelial cells. To re-evaluate this issue, we reduced the expression of DICER1 or DROSHA by RNAi-mediated knockdown and subsequently investigated the effect of these interventions on the angiogenic capacity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro (proliferation, migration, tube formation, endothelial cell spheroid sprouting) and in a HUVEC xenograft assay in immune incompetent NSG(TM) mice in vivo. In contrast to previous reports, neither knockdown of DICER1 nor knockdown of DROSHA profoundly affected migration or tube formation of HUVEC or the angiogenic capacity of HUVEC in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of DICER1 and the combined knockdown of DICER1 and DROSHA tended to increase VEGF-induced BrdU incorporation and induced angiogenic sprouting from HUVEC spheroids. Consistent with these observations, global proteomic analyses showed that knockdown of DICER1 or DROSHA only moderately altered HUVEC protein expression profiles but additively reduced, for example, expression of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1. In conclusion, global reduction of miRNA biogenesis by knockdown of DICER1 or DROSHA does not inhibit the angiogenic capacity of HUVEC. Further studies are therefore needed to elucidate the influence of these enzymes in the context of human endothelial cell-related angiogenesis.
PXD026927	34576208	Oestrogen Activates the MAP3K1 Cascade and beta-Catenin to Promote Granulosa-like Cell Fate in a Human Testis-Derived Cell Line. 	Oestrogen Activates the MAP3K1 Cascade and beta-catenin to Promote Granulosa-Like Cell Fate in a Human Testis-Derived Cell Line	MAP3K1, SOX9, beta-catenin, oestrogen	Sex determination triggers the differentiation of the bi-potential gonad into either an ovary or testis. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the presence or absence of oestrogen dictates gonad differentiation, while in mammals, this mechanism has been supplanted by the testis-determining gene SRY. Exogenous oestrogen can override this genetic trigger to shift somatic cell fate in the gonad towards ovarian developmental pathways by limiting the bioavailability of the key testis factor SOX9 within somatic cells. Our previous work has implicated the MAPK pathway in mediating the rapid cellular response to oestrogen. We performed proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses to investigate the precise mechanism through which oestrogen impacts these pathways to activate beta-catenin-a factor essential for ovarian development. We show that oestrogen can activate beta-catenin within 30 min, concomitant with the cytoplasmic retention of SOX9. This occurs through changes to the MAP3K1 cascade, suggesting this pathway is a mechanism through which oestrogen influences gonad somatic cell fate. We demonstrate that oestrogen can promote the shift from SOX9 pro-testis activity to beta-catenin pro-ovary activity through activation of MAP3K1. Our findings define a previously unknown mechanism through which oestrogen can promote a switch in gonad somatic cell fate and provided novel insights into the impacts of exogenous oestrogen exposure on the testis.
PXD024937	34576238	Analysis of Molecular Networks in the Cerebellum in Chronic Schizophrenia: Modulation by Early Postnatal Life Stressors in Murine Models. 	Analysis Of Molecular Networks In The Cerebellum In Chronic Schizophrenia: Modulation By Early Postnatal Life Stressors In Murine Models	Cerebellum, brain	Despite the growing importance of the cerebellum as a region highly vulnerable to accumulating molecular errors in schizophrenia, limited information is available regarding altered molecular networks with potential therapeutic targets. To identify altered networks, we conducted one-shot liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in postmortem cerebellar cortex in schizophrenia and healthy individuals followed by bioinformatic analysis (PXD024937 identifier in ProteomeXchange repository). A total of 108 up-regulated proteins were enriched in stress-related proteins, half of which were also enriched in axonal cytoskeletal organization and vesicle-mediated transport. A total of 142 down-regulated proteins showed an enrichment in proteins involved in mitochondrial disease, most of which were also enriched in energy-related biological functions. Network analysis identified a mixed module of mainly axonal-related pathways for up-regulated proteins with a high number of interactions for stress-related proteins. Energy metabolism and neutrophil degranulation modules were found for down-regulated proteins. Further, two double-hit postnatal stress murine models based on maternal deprivation combined with social isolation or chronic restraint stress were used to investigate the most robust candidates of generated networks. CLASP1 from the axonal module in the model of maternal deprivation was combined with social isolation, while YWHAZ was not altered in either model. METTL7A from the degranulation pathway was reduced in both models and was identified as altered also in previous gene expression studies, while NDUFB9 from the energy network was reduced only in the model of maternal deprivation combined with social isolation. This work provides altered stress- and mitochondrial disease-related proteins involved in energy, immune and axonal networks in the cerebellum in schizophrenia as possible novel targets for therapeutic interventions and suggests that METTL7A is a possible relevant altered stress-related protein in this context.
PXD028515	34576246	Burn Injury Induces Proinflammatory Plasma Extracellular Vesicles That Associate with Length of Hospital Stay in Women: CRP and SAA1 as Potential Prognostic Indicators. 	Identification of plasma extracellular vesicle biomarkers after burn injury	extracellular vesicles, label-free quantitation, microvesicle	Severe burn injury is a devastating form of trauma that results in persistent immune dysfunction with associated morbidity and mortality. The underlying drivers of this immune dysfunction remain elusive, and there are no prognostic markers to identify at-risk patients. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as drivers of immune dysfunction as well as biomarkers. We investigated if EVs after burn injury promote macrophage activation and assessed if EV contents can predict length of hospital stay. EVs isolated early from mice that received a 20% total body surface area (TBSA) burn promoted proinflammatory responses in cultured splenic macrophages. Unbiased LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of early EVs (<72 h post-injury) from mice and humans showed some similarities including enrichment of acute phase response proteins such as CRP and SAA1. Semi-unbiased assessment of early human burn patient EVs found alterations consistent with increased proinflammatory signaling and loss of inhibition of CRP expression. In a sample of 50 patients with large burn injury, EV SAA1 and CRP were correlated with TBSA injury in both sexes and were correlated with length of hospital stay in women. These findings suggest that EVs are drivers of immune responses after burn injury and their content may predict hospital course.
PXD026587	34576262	Synergistic Interactions of Cannabidiol with Chemotherapeutic Drugs in MCF7 Cells: Mode of Interaction and Proteomics Analysis of Mechanisms. 	Shotgun proteomic elucidation of Synergistic mechanisms of Cannabidiol and SN-38 in the MCF7 cells	7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, Breast cancer, CBD, Cannabidiol, MCF7, SN-38, Synergy	Cannabidiol (CBD), a nonpsychoactive phytocannabinoid, has recently emerged as a potential cytotoxic agent in addition to its ameliorative activity in chemotherapy-associated side effects. In this work, the potential interactions of CBD with docetaxel (DOC), doxorubicin (DOX), paclitaxel (PTX), vinorelbine (VIN), and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) were explored in MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells using different synergy quantification models. The apoptotic profiles of MCF7 cells after the treatments were assessed via flow cytometry. The molecular mechanisms of CBD and the most promising combinations were investigated via label-free quantification proteomics. A strong synergy was observed across all synergy models at different molar ratios of CBD in combination with SN-38 and VIN. Intriguingly, synergy was observed for CBD with all chemotherapeutic drugs at a molar ratio of 636:1 in almost all synergy models. However, discording synergy trends warranted the validation of the selected combinations against different models. Enhanced apoptosis was observed for all synergistic CBD combinations compared to monotherapies or negative controls. A shotgun proteomics study highlighted 121 dysregulated proteins in CBD-treated MCF7 cells compared to the negative controls. We reported the inhibition of topoisomerase II beta and alpha, cullin 1, V-type proton ATPase, and CDK-6 in CBD-treated MCF7 cells for the first time as additional cytotoxic mechanisms of CBD, alongside sabotaged energy production and reduced mitochondrial translation. We observed 91 significantly dysregulated proteins in MCF7 cells treated with the synergistic combination of CBD with SN-38 (CSN-38), compared to the monotherapies. Regulation of telomerase, cell cycle, topoisomerase I, EGFR1, protein metabolism, TP53 regulation of DNA repair, death receptor signalling, and RHO GTPase signalling pathways contributed to the proteome-wide synergistic molecular mechanisms of CSN-38. In conclusion, we identified significant synergistic interactions between CBD and the five important chemotherapeutic drugs and the key molecular pathways of CBD and its synergistic combination with SN-38 in MCF7 cells. Further in vivo and clinical studies are warranted to evaluate the implementation of CBD-based synergistic adjuvant therapies for breast cancer.
PXD008885	34578131	Approaching In Vivo Models of Pneumococcus-Host Interaction: Insights into Surface Proteins, Capsule Production, and Extracellular Vesicles. 	Pneumococcal surface tryptic digestion	streptococcus pneumoniae, surface proteins, surfomic, trypsin, vaccine	Infections caused by the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae have become a major health problem worldwide because of their high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in developing countries. This microorganism colonizes the human upper respiratory tract and becomes pathogenic under certain circumstances, which are not well known. In the interaction with the host, bacterial surface structures and proteins play major roles. To gain knowledge into gradual changes and adaptive mechanisms that this pathogen undergoes from when it enters the host, we mimicked several in vivo situations representing interaction with epithelial and macrophage cells, as well as a condition of presence in blood. Then, we analyzed, in four pneumococcal strains, two major surface structures, the capsule and extracellular vesicles produced by the pneumococci, as well as surface proteins by proteomics, using the "shaving" approach, followed by LC-MS/MS. We found important differences in both surface ultrastructures and proteins among the culture conditions and strains used. Thus, this work provides insights into physiological adaptations of the pneumococcus when it interacts with the host, which may be useful for the design of strategies to combat infections caused by this pathogen.
PXD027172	34578313	Examining the Effects of an Anti-Salmonella Bacteriophage Preparation, BAFASAL((R)), on Ex-Vivo Human Gut Microbiome Composition and Function Using a Multi-Omics Approach. 	Effects of BAFASAL on human microbiome	metaproteomics, microbiome assay, phage	Salmonella infections (salmonellosis) pose serious health risks to humans, usually via food-chain contamination. This foodborne pathogen causes major food losses and human illnesses, with significant economic impacts. Overuse of antibiotics in the food industry has led to multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria, and governments are now restricting their use, leading the food industry to search for alternatives to secure food chains. Bacteriophages, viruses that infect and kill bacteria, are currently being investigated and used as replacement treatments and prophylactics due to their specificity and efficacy. They are generally regarded as safe alternatives to antibiotics, as they are natural components of the ecosystem. However, when specifically used in the industry, they can also make their way into humans through our food chain or exposure, as is the case for antibiotics. In particular, agricultural workers could be repeatedly exposed to bacteriophages supplemented to animal feeds. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effects of such exposure to bacteriophages on the human gut microbiome. In this study, we used a novel in-vitro assay called RapidAIM to investigate the effect of a bacteriophage mixture, BAFASAL((R)), used in poultry farming on five individual human gut microbiomes. Multi-omics analyses, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomic, revealed that ex-vivo human gut microbiota composition and function were unaffected by BAFASAL((R)) treatment, providing an additional measure for its safety. Due to the critical role of the gut microbiome in human health and the known role of bacteriophages in regulation of microbiome composition and function, we suggest assaying the impact of bacteriophage-cocktails on the human gut microbiome as a part of their safety assessment.
PXD027260	34578385	Construction, Identification and Analysis of the Interaction Network of African Swine Fever Virus MGF360-9L with Host Proteins. 	Screening of host proteins interacting with African swine fever virus MGF360-9L	African swine fever virus, MGF360-9L, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, protein interaction	African swine fever virus (ASFV) is prevalent in many countries and is a contagious and lethal virus that infects pigs, posing a threat to the global pig industry and public health. The interaction between the virus and the host is key to unlocking the mystery behind viral pathogenesis. A comprehensive understanding of the viral and host protein interaction may provide clues for developing new antiviral strategies. Here, we show a network of ASFV MGF360-9L protein interactions in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. Overall, 268 proteins that interact with MGF360-9L are identified using immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Accordingly, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was created. It was speculated that the cellular proteins interacting with MGF360-9L are involved in protein binding, metabolism, and the innate immune response. Proteasome subunit alpha type (PSMA3), 26S protease regulatory subunit 4 (PSMC1), autophagy and beclin 1 regulator 1 (AMBRA1), and DEAD-box helicase 20 (DDX20) could interact with MGF360-9L in vitro. PSMA3 and PSMC1 overexpression significantly promoted ASFV replication, and MGF360-9L maintained the transcriptional level of PSMA3 and PSMC1. Here, we show the interaction between ASFV MGF360-9L and cellular proteins and elucidate the virus-host interaction network, which effectively provides useful protein-related information that can enable further study of the potential mechanism and pathogenesis of ASFV infection.
PXD028310	34578700	Detection of Circulating Serum Protein Biomarkers of Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer after Protein Corona-Silver Nanoparticles Analysis by SWATH-MS. 	Detection of Circulating Serum Protein Biomarkers of Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer after the Protein Corona-Silver Nanoparticles Analysis by SWATH-MS	Protein corona (PC), SWATH-MS, bi-omarkers, bladder cancer (BC), fingerprinting, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)	Because cystoscopy is expensive and invasive, a new method of detecting non-invasive muscular bladder cancer (NMIBC) is needed. This study aims to identify potential serum protein markers for NMIBC to improve diagnosis and to find treatment approaches that avoid disease progression to a life-threatening phenotype (muscle-invasive bladder cancer, MIBC). Here, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs, 9.73 +/- 1.70 nm) as a scavenging device together with sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) were used to quantitatively analyze the blood serum protein alterations in two NMIBC subtypes, T1 and Ta, and they were compared to normal samples (HC). NMIBC's analysis of serum samples identified three major groups of proteins, the relative content of which is different from the HC content: proteins implicated in the complement and coagulation cascade pathways and apolipoproteins. In conclusion, many biomarker proteins were identified that merit further examination to validate their useful significance and utility within the clinical management of NMIBC patients.
PXD028348	34581808	The human sperm basal body is a complex centrosome important for embryo preimplantation development. 	Human sperm tails proteomics - Centrosome enrichment	centrosome, sperm cells	The mechanism of conversion of the human sperm basal body to a centrosome after fertilization, and its role in supporting human early embryogenesis, has not been directly addressed so far. Using proteomics and immunofluorescence studies, we show here that the human zygote inherits a basal body enriched with centrosomal proteins from the sperm, establishing the first functional centrosome of the new organism. Injection of human sperm tails containing the basal body into human oocytes followed by parthenogenetic activation, showed that the centrosome contributes to the robustness of the early cell divisions, increasing the probability of parthenotes reaching the compaction stage. In the absence of the sperm-derived centrosome, pericentriolar material (PCM) components stored in the oocyte can form de novo structures after genome activation, suggesting a tight PCM expression control in zygotes. Our results reveal that the sperm basal body is a complex organelle which converts to a centrosome after fertilization, ensuring the early steps of embryogenesis and successful compaction. However, more experiments are needed to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms of centrosome inheritance in humans.
PXD023451	34581812	Nucleolar TFIIE plays a role in ribosomal biogenesis and performance. 	Nucleolar TFIIE plays a role in ribosomal biogenesis and performance	RNA polymerase I, Ribosome, TFIIE, proteostasis, translational fidelity	Ribosome biogenesis is a highly energy-demanding process in eukaryotes which requires the concerted action of all three RNA polymerases. In RNA polymerase II transcription, the general transcription factor TFIIH is recruited by TFIIE to the initiation site of protein-coding genes. Distinct mutations in TFIIH and TFIIE give rise to the degenerative disorder trichothiodystrophy (TTD). Here, we uncovered an unexpected role of TFIIE in ribosomal RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I. With high resolution microscopy we detected TFIIE in the nucleolus where TFIIE binds to actively transcribed rDNA. Mutations in TFIIE affects gene-occupancy of RNA polymerase I, rRNA maturation, ribosomal assembly and performance. In consequence, the elevated translational error rate with imbalanced protein synthesis and turnover results in an increase in heat-sensitive proteins. Collectively, mutations in TFIIE-due to impaired ribosomal biogenesis and translational accuracy-lead to a loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) which can partly explain the clinical phenotype in TTD.

While the respective bodies of literature and -omics data for each of these organisms are extensive, comparatively few studies investigate the molecular biological processes occurring between the two. We are interested in elucidating the network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involved in human-soybean allergies. To this end, we leverage state-of-the-art sequence-based PPI predictors amenable to predicting the enormous comprehensive interactome between human and soybean. A network-based analytical approach is proposed, leveraging similar interaction profiles to identify candidate allergens and proteins involved in the allergy response. Interestingly, the predicted interactome can be explored from two complementary perspectives: which soybean proteins are predicted to interact with specific human proteins and which human proteins are predicted to interact with specific soybean proteins. A total of eight proteins (six specific to the human proteome and two to the soy proteome) have been identified and supported by the literature to be involved in human health, specifically related to immunological and neurological pathways. This study, beyond generating the most comprehensive human-soybean interactome to date, elucidated a soybean seed interactome and identified several proteins putatively consequential to human health.
PXD027103	34582688	Enrichment and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab Using Affimer Reagents. 	Unspecific Binding of Beads to Plasma Proteins	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Antibodies (B/D-HPP), Unspecif binding Plsam proteins	Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies used in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Therapeutic proteins may undergo chemical modifications that may affect the results of bioanalytical assays, as well as their therapeutic efficacy. Modifications may arise during production and storage, as well as after administration to patients. Studying in vivo biotransformation of monoclonal, therapeutic antibodies requires their enrichment from plasma to discriminate them from endogenous antibodies, as well as from other plasma proteins. To this end, we screened Affimer reagents for selectivity toward trastuzumab or pertuzumab. Affimer reagents are alternative binding proteins possessing two variable binding loops that are based on the human protease inhibitor stefin A or phytocystatin protein scaffolds. Affimer reagents were selected from an extensive library by phage display. The four best-performing binders for each therapeutic antibody were prioritized using a microtiter plate-based approach combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. These Affimer reagents were immobilized via engineered 6-His or Cys tags to Ni(2+)- or maleimide beads, respectively. Recovery values of 70% and higher were obtained for both trastuzumab and pertuzumab when spiked at 100, 150, and 200 mug/mL concentrations in human plasma followed by trypsin digestion in the presence of 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Notably, the maleimide beads showed undetectable unspecific binding to endogenous immunoglobulin G (IgGs) or other plasma proteins when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The enrichment method was applied to samples from stress tests of the antibodies at 37 degreesC to mimic in vivo conditions.
PXD027887	34582793	Intrinsic bias at non-canonical, beta-arrestin-coupled seven transmembrane receptors. 	Intrinsic bias at non-canonical, beta-arrestin-coupled seven transmembrane receptors	Complement C5a, GPCR kinases, GPCRs, biased signaling, seven transmembrane receptors, beta-arrestin-coupled receptors, beta-arrestins	G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs), typically interact with two distinct signal-transducers, i.e., G proteins and beta-arrestins (betaarrs). Interestingly, there are some non-canonical 7TMRs that lack G protein coupling but interact with betaarrs, although an understanding of their transducer coupling preference, downstream signaling, and structural mechanism remains elusive. Here, we characterize two such non-canonical 7TMRs, namely, the decoy D6 receptor (D6R) and the complement C5a receptor subtype 2 (C5aR2), in parallel with their canonical GPCR counterparts. We discover that D6R and C5aR2 efficiently couple to betaarrs, exhibit distinct engagement of GPCR kinases (GRKs), and activate non-canonical downstream signaling pathways. We also observe that betaarrs adopt distinct conformations for D6R and C5aR2, compared to their canonical GPCR counterparts, in response to common natural agonists. Our study establishes D6R and C5aR2 as betaarr-coupled 7TMRs and provides key insights into their regulation and signaling with direct implication for biased agonism.
PXD027423	34582888	Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein complex regulates alternative splicing and polyadenylation at potential G-quadruplex-forming splice site sequences. 	CBLL1 IP from HUVEC whole cell lysates	CBLL1, PPI	Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) is a core component of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-methyltransferase complex, along with VIRMA, CBLL1, ZC3H13 (KIAA0853), RBM15/15B, and METTL3/14, which generate m6A, a key RNA modification that affects various processes of RNA metabolism. WTAP also interacts with splicing factors; however, despite strong evidence suggesting a role of Drosophila WTAP homolog fl(2)d in alternative splicing (AS), its role in splicing regulation in mammalian cells remains elusive. Here we demonstrate using RNAi coupled with RNA-seq that WTAP, VIRMA, CBLL1, and ZC3H13 modulate AS, promoting exon skipping and intron retention in AS events that involve short introns/exons with higher GC content and introns with weaker polypyrimidine-tract and branch points. Further analysis of GC-rich sequences involved in AS events regulated by WTAP, together with minigene assay analysis, revealed potential G-quadruplex formation at splice sites where WTAP has an inhibitory effect. We also found that several AS events occur in the last exon of one isoform of MSL1 and WTAP, leading to competition for polyadenylation. Proteomic analysis also suggested that WTAP/CBLL1 interaction promotes recruitment of the 3'-end processing complex. Taken together, our results indicate that the WTAP complex regulates AS and alternative polyadenylation via inhibitory mechanisms in GC-rich sequences.
PXD026437	34583635	Exploration of the lactation function of protein phosphorylation sites in goat mammary tissues by phosphoproteome analysis. 	Explore the lactation function of Protein phosphorylation sites in goat mammary tissues by phosphoproteome	IRS1, Phosphoproteome, goat, lactation, triglycerides, beta-casein	BACKGROUND: Protein phosphorylation plays an important role in lactation. Differentially modified phosphorylation sites and phosphorylated proteins between peak lactation (PL, 90 days postpartum) and late lactation (LL, 280 days postpartum) were investigated using an integrated approach, namely, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, to determine the molecular changes in the mammary tissues during the different stages of goat lactation. RESULTS: A total of 1,938 (1,111 upregulated, 827 downregulated) differentially modified phosphorylation sites of 1,172 proteins were identified (P values < 0.05 and fold change of phosphorylation ratios > 1.5). Multiple phosphorylation sites of FASN, ACACA, mTOR, PRKAA, IRS1, RPS6KB, EIF4EBP1, JUN, and TSC2 were different in PL compared with LL. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the calcium signaling pathway, oxytocin signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway were enriched. The western blot results showed that the phosphorylation levels of ACACA (Ser80), EIF4EBP1 (Thr46) and IRS1 (Ser312) increased and JUN (Ser63) decreased in PL compared with LL. These results were consistent with the phosphoproteome results. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified for the first time the differentially modified phosphorylation sites in goat mammary tissues between PL and LL. These results indicate that the multiple differentially modified phosphorylation sites of FASN, ACACA, mTOR, PRKAA, IRS1, RPS6KB, EIF4EBP1, TSC2, and JUN and proteins involved in the calcium signaling pathway, oxytocin signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway are worthy of further exploration.
PXD024680	34583743	Activity of the mouse Notch ligand DLL1 is sensitive to C-terminal tagging in vivo. 	Activity of the mouse Notch ligand DLL1 is sensitive to C-terminal tagging in vivo	endogenous tagging, protein complexes	OBJECTIVE: The mammalian Notch ligand DLL1 has essential functions during development. To visualise DLL1 in tissues, for sorting and enrichment of DLL1-expressing cells, and to efficiently purify DLL1 protein complexes we tagged DLL1 in mice with AcGFPHA or Strep/FLAG. RESULTS: We generated constructs to express DLL1 that carried C-terminal in-frame an AcGFPHA tag flanked by loxP sites followed by a Strep/FLAG (SF) tag out of frame. Cre-mediated recombination replaced AcGFP-HA by SF. The AcGFPHAstopSF cassette was added to DLL1 for tests in cultured cells and introduced into endogenous DLL1 in mice by homologous recombination. Tagged DLL1 protein was detected by antibodies against GFP and HA or Flag, respectively, both in CHO cells and embryo lysates. In CHO cells the AcGFP fluorophore fused to DLL1 was functional. In vivo AcGFP expression was below the level of detection by direct fluorescence. However, the SF tag allowed us to specifically purify DLL1 complexes from embryo lysates. Homozygous mice expressing AcGFPHA or SF-tagged DLL1 revealed a vertebral column phenotype reminiscent of disturbances in AP polarity during somitogenesis, a process most sensitive to reduced DLL1 function. Thus, even small C-terminal tags can impinge on sensitive developmental processes requiring DLL1 activity.
PXD020141	34584066	The long non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1 promotes tumor aggressiveness and radiotherapy resistance in glioblastoma. 	The long non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1 promotes tumor aggressiveness and radiotherapy resistance in glioblastoma	Glioblastoma, HOTAIRM1, long non-coding RNA, radiosensitivity	Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor. To date, clinically relevant biomarkers are restricted to isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene 1 or 2 mutations and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to contribute to glioblastoma pathogenesis and could potentially serve as novel biomarkers. The clinical significance of HOXA Transcript Antisense RNA, Myeloid-Specific 1 (HOTAIRM1) was determined by analyzing HOTAIRM1 in multiple glioblastoma gene expression data sets for associations with prognosis, as well as, IDH mutation and MGMT promoter methylation status. Finally, the role of HOTAIRM1 in glioblastoma biology and radiotherapy resistance was characterized in vitro and in vivo. We identified HOTAIRM1 as a candidate lncRNA whose up-regulation is significantly associated with shorter survival of glioblastoma patients, independent from IDH mutation and MGMT promoter methylation. Glioblastoma cell line models uniformly showed reduced cell viability, decreased invasive growth and diminished colony formation capacity upon HOTAIRM1 down-regulation. Integrated proteogenomic analyses revealed impaired mitochondrial function and determination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels confirmed increased ROS levels upon HOTAIRM1 knock-down. HOTAIRM1 knock-down decreased expression of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), a candidate protein implicated in mitochondrial function, and knock-down of TGM2 mimicked the phenotype of HOTAIRM1 down-regulation in glioblastoma cells. Moreover, HOTAIRM1 modulates radiosensitivity of glioblastoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our data support a role for HOTAIRM1 as a driver of biological aggressiveness, radioresistance and poor outcome in glioblastoma. Targeting HOTAIRM1 may be a promising new therapeutic approach.
PXD022452	34584135	Protein expression reveals a molecular sexual identity of avian primordial germ cells at pre-gonadal stages. 	Molecular sexual identity of chicken in vitro derived pre-gonadal primordial germ cells	Chicken, primordial germ cells, sex differentiation	In poultry, in vitro propagated primordial germ cells (PGCs) represent an important tool for the cryopreservation of avian genetic resources. However, several studies have highlighted sexual differences exhibited by PGCs during in vitro propagation, which may compromise their reproductive capacities. To understand this phenomenon, we compared the proteome of pregonadal migratory male (ZZ) and female (ZW) chicken PGCs propagated in vitro by quantitative proteomic analysis using a GeLC-MS/MS strategy. Many proteins were found to be differentially abundant in chicken male and female PGCs indicating their early sexual identity. Many of the proteins more highly expressed in male PGCs were encoded by genes localised to the Z sex chromosome. This suggests that the known lack of dosage compensation of the transcription of Z-linked genes between sexes persists at the protein level in PGCs, and that this may be a key factor of their autonomous sex differentiation. We also found that globally, protein differences do not closely correlate with transcript differences indicating a selective translational mechanism in PGCs. Male and female PGC expressed protein sets were associated with differential biological processes and contained proteins known to be biologically relevant for male and female germ cell development, respectively. We also discovered that female PGCs have a higher capacity to uptake proteins from the cell culture medium than male PGCs. This study presents the first evidence of an early predetermined sex specific cell fate of chicken PGCs and their sexual molecular specificities which will enable the development of more precise sex-specific in vitro culture conditions for the preservation of avian genetic resources.
PXD024030	34585037	Identification and Functional Characterization of a Novel Androgen Receptor Coregulator, EAP1. 	Androgen receptor RIME using LNCaP cells	AR, IRF2BPL, RIME	The androgen receptor (AR) plays an essential role in the development of prostate cancer, and androgen-deprivation therapy is used as a first-line treatment for prostate cancer. However, under androgen-deprivation therapy, castration-resistant prostate cancer inevitably arises, suggesting that the interacting transcriptional coregulators of AR are promising targets for developing novel therapeutics. In this study, we used novel proteomic techniques to evaluate the AR interactome, including biochemically labile binding proteins, which might go undetected by conventional purification methods. Using rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins, we identified enhanced at puberty 1 (EAP1) as a novel AR coregulator, whereas its interaction with AR could not be detected under standard biochemical conditions. EAP1 enhanced the transcriptional activity of AR via the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and its ubiquitination substrate proteins included AR and HDAC1. Furthermore, in prostate cancer specimens, EAP1 expression was significantly correlated with AR expression as well as a poor prognosis of prostate cancer. Together, these results suggest that EAP1 is a novel AR coregulator that promotes AR activity and potentially plays a role in prostate cancer progression.
PXD027945	34585113	Phagocytosis by stroma confounds coculture studies. 	Proteomics of HS-5 and NKTert stroma cells	Stroma HS-5 NKTert Proteomics	Signals provided by the microenvironment can modify and circumvent pathway activities that are therapeutically targeted by drugs. Bone marrow stromal cell coculture models are frequently used to study the influence of the bone marrow niche on ex vivo drug response. Here, we show that mesenchymal stromal cells from selected donors and NKTert, a stromal cell line, which is commonly used for coculture studies with primary leukemia cells, extensively phagocytose apoptotic cells. This could lead to misinterpretation of results, especially if viability readouts of the target cells (e.g. leukemic cells) in such coculture models are based on the relative proportions of dead and alive cells. Future coculture studies which aim to investigate the impact of bone marrow stromal cells on drug response should take into account that stromal cells have the capacity to phagocytose apoptotic cells.
PXD023497	34585527	Bile acid metabolism dysregulation associates with cancer cachexia: roles of liver and gut microbiome. 	TMT-based proteomic approach was used to compare the liver protein expression profiles of cancer cachexia mice and healthy control mice	cachexia, liver, mice	BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial metabolic syndrome in which bile acid (BA) metabolism might be involved. The aim of the present study was to clarify the contribution of liver and gut microbiota to BA metabolism disturbance in cancer cachexia and to check the possibility of targeting BA metabolism using agents such as tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) for cancer cachexia therapy. METHODS: The BA profiles in liver, intestine, and serum of mice with cancer cachexia induced by inoculation of colon C26 tumour cells were analysed using metabolomics methods and compared with that of control mice. Proteomic analysis of liver protein expression profile and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of gut microbiota composition in cancer cachexia mice were conducted. Expression levels of genes related to farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling pathway in the intestine and liver tissues were analysed using RT-PCR analysis. The BA profiles in serum of clinical colon cancer patients with or without cachexia were also analysed and compared with that of healthy volunteers. The effects of TUDCA in treating cancer cachexia mice were observed. RESULTS: In the liver of cancer cachexia mice, expression of BA synthesis enzymes was inhibited while the amount of total BAs increased (P < 0.05). The ratios of conjugated BAs/un-conjugated BAs significantly increased in cancer cachexia mice liver (P < 0.01). Gut microbiota dysbiosis such as decrease in Lachnospiraceae and increase in Enterobacteriaceae was observed in the intestine of cancer cachexia mice, and microbial metabolism of BAs was reduced. Increase in expression of FGF15 in intestine (P < 0.01) suggested the activation of FXR signalling pathway which might contribute to the regulation of BA synthesis enzymes, transporters, and metabolic enzymes. Increase in the BA conjugation was observed in the serum of cancer cachexia mice. Results of clinical patients showed changes in BA metabolism, especially the increase in BA conjugation, and also suggested compensatory mechanism in BA metabolism regulation. Oral administration of 50 mg/kg TUDCA could significantly ameliorate the decrease in body weight (P < 0.001), muscle loss (P < 0.001), and atrophy of heart and liver (P < 0.05) in cancer cachexia mice without influence on tumour growth. CONCLUSIONS: Bile acid metabolism dysregulation such as decrease in BA synthesis, increase in BA conjugation, and decrease in BA microbial metabolism was involved in development of cancer cachexia in mice. Targeting BA metabolism using agents such as TUDCA might be helpful for cancer cachexia therapy.
PXD023899	34585630	Exploration of the typical features of tubulovillous adenoma using in-depth quantitative proteomics analysis. 	Proteome profiling of normal epithelium, tubular adenoma, tubulovillous adenoma, high-grade neoplasia, cancer tissues in colorectum	carcinogenesis, colorectal adenoma, colorectal cancer, high-grade neoplasia, quantitative proteomics, tubulovillous adenoma	This present study aimed to explore the typical protein features of tubulovillous adenoma (TVA) using proteomic and bioinformatic analyses. Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analyses were conducted on normal mucosa, tubular adenoma, TVA and adenocarcinoma tissues. We identified 5,665 proteins categorized into seven clusters based on Pearson's correlation analysis. The bioinfomatic analysis showed mitochondrial and metabolism-related events were typical characteristics of TVA and mitochondrial-, ribosome- and matrisome-related biological processes may contribute to carcinogenesis. PLOD3 was identified as a key protein associated with the malignant potential of TVA and promoted the viability of adenoma organoids. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis revealed PLOD3 as a risk factor for disease-free and overall survival. Furthermore, the PLOD3 expression correlated negatively with the abundance of B cells, CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, neutrophils, macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells. In conclusion, enhanced metabolic and mitochondrial reprogramming are typical features of TVA, and PLOD3 might be related to the "immune desert" phenotype and contribute to TVA tumorigenesis and colorectal cancer development.
PXD025166	34585727	LRRC23 is a conserved component of the radial spoke that is necessary for sperm motility and male fertility in mice. 	Lrrc23 WT and KO whole sperm proteomic analysis	LRRC23, sperm flagella	Cilia and flagella are ancient structures that achieve controlled motor functions through the coordinated interaction based on microtubules and some attached projections. Radial spokes (RSs) facilitate the beating motion of these organelles by mediating signal transduction between dyneins and a central pair (CP) of singlet microtubules. RS complex isolation from Chlamydomonas axonemes enabled the detection of 23 radial spoke proteins (RSP1-RSP23), although the roles of some radial spoke proteins remain unknown. Recently, RSP15 has been reported to be bound to the stalk of RS2, but its homolog in mammals has not been identified. Herein, we show that Lrrc23 is an evolutionarily conserved testis-enriched gene encoding an RSP15 homolog in mice. We found that LRRC23 localizes to the RS complex within murine sperm flagella and interacts with RSPH3A and RSPH3B. The knockout of Lrrc23 resulted in male infertility due to RS disorganization and impaired motility in murine spermatozoa, whereas the ciliary beating was not significantly affected. These data indicate that LRRC23 is a key regulator that underpins the integrity of the RS complex within the flagella of mammalian spermatozoa, whereas it is dispensable in cilia. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.
PXD019638	34586745	Glutathione peroxidase 4-dependent glutathione high-consumption drives acquired platinum chemoresistance in lung cancer-derived brain metastasis. 	GPX4-dependent Glutathione (GSH) high consumption drives platinum chemotherapeutic resistance by inhibiting ferroptosis in lung cancer derived brain metastasis	GPX4, brain metastasis, chemotherapeutic resistance, ferroptosis, glutathione metabolism, lung cancer	BACKGROUND: Platinum-based chemotherapy is effective in inducing shrinkage of primary lung cancer lesions; however, it shows finite therapeutic efficacy in patients suffering from brain metastasis (BM). The intrinsic changes of BM cells, which contribute to the poor results remain unknown. METHODS: Platinum drug-sensitivity was assessed by utilizing a preclinical BM model of PC9 lung adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. High consumption of glutathione (GSH) and two associated upregulated proteins (GPX4 and GSTM1) in BM were identified by integrated metabolomics and proteomics in cell lines and verified by clinical serum sample. Gain-of-function and rescue experiments were implemented to reveal the impact and mechanism of GPX4 and GSTM1 on the chemosensitivity in BM. The interaction between GPX4 and GSTM1 was examined by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. The mechanism of upregulation of GPX4 was further uncovered by luciferase reporter assay, immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RESULTS: The derivative brain metastatic subpopulations (PC9-BrMs) of parental cells PC9 developed obvious resistance to platinum. Radically altered profiles of BM metabolism and protein expression compared with primary lung cancer cells were described and GPX4 and GSTM1 were identified as being responsible for the high consumption of GSH, leading to decreased chemosensitivity by negatively regulating ferroptosis. Besides, GSTM1 was found regulated by GPX4, which was transcriptionally activated by the Wnt/NR2F2 signaling axis in BM. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings demonstrated that Wnt/NR2F2/GPX4 promoted acquired chemoresistance by suppressing ferroptosis with high consumption of GSH. GPX4 inhibitor was found to augment the anticancer effect of platinum drugs in lung cancer BM, providing novel strategies for lung cancer patients with BM.
PXD026798	34587999	Increasing the power of interpretation for soil metaproteomics data. 	Strategies for the interpretation of soil metaproteomic data	bioinformatics, mags, metagenomics, metaproteomics, sediment, soil	BACKGROUND: Soil and sediment microorganisms are highly phylogenetically diverse but are currently largely under-represented in public molecular databases. Their functional characterization by means of metaproteomics is usually performed using metagenomic sequences acquired for the same sample. However, such hugely diverse metagenomic datasets are difficult to assemble; in parallel, theoretical proteomes from isolates available in generic databases are of high quality. Both these factors advocate for the use of theoretical proteomes in metaproteomics interpretation pipelines. Here, we examined a number of database construction strategies with a view to increasing the outputs of metaproteomics studies performed on soil samples. RESULTS: The number of peptide-spectrum matches was found to be of comparable magnitude when using public or sample-specific metagenomics-derived databases. However, numbers were significantly increased when a combination of both types of information was used in a two-step cascaded search. Our data also indicate that the functional annotation of the metaproteomics dataset can be maximized by using a combination of both types of databases. CONCLUSIONS: A two-step strategy combining sample-specific metagenome database and public databases such as the non-redundant NCBI database and a massive soil gene catalog allows maximizing the metaproteomic interpretation both in terms of ratio of assigned spectra and retrieval of function-derived information.

PXD026874	34590387	Inhibition of Autophagy by a Small Molecule through Covalent Modification of the LC3 Protein. 	ABPP-LC/MS results of covalent inhibitor targeting LC3A/B in HeLa cells	ABPP, Autophagy, LC3, covalent	The autophagic ubiquitin-like protein LC3 functions through interactions with LC3-interaction regions (LIRs) of other autophagy proteins, including autophagy receptors, which stands out as a promising protein-protein interaction (PPI) target for the intervention of autophagy. Post-translational modifications like acetylation of Lys49 on the LIR-interacting surface could disrupt the interaction, offering an opportunity to design covalent small molecules interfering with the interface. Through screening covalent compounds, we discovered a small molecule modulator of LC3A/B that covalently modifies LC3A/B protein at Lys49. Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) based evaluations reveal that a derivative molecule DC-LC3in-D5 exhibits a potent covalent reactivity and selectivity to LC3A/B in HeLa cells. DC-LC3in-D5 compromises LC3B lipidation in vitro and in HeLa cells, leading to deficiency in the formation of autophagic structures and autophagic substrate degradation. DC-LC3in-D5 could serve as a powerful tool for autophagy research as well as for therapeutic interventions.
PXD022802	34590603	Comprehensive Proteomic Analysis of Colon Cancer Tissue Revealed the Reason for the Worse Prognosis of Right-Sided Colon Cancer and Mucinous Colon Cancer at the Protein Level. 	Proteome profiling of mucinous and non-mucinous colorectal cancer	TMT, colorectal cancer, mucinous	To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the poor prognosis of right-sided and mucinous colon cancer at the proteomic level. A tandem mass tag-proteomics approach was used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in colon carcinoma tissues from different locations and with different histological types to reveal the underlying mechanisms of these differences at the protein level. In additional, the DEPs were analyzed using bioinformatics methods. The proteomics profiles among colon cancers with different tumor locations and histological types were dramatically distinguished. In terms of tumor locations, the right-sided carcinoma specific DEPs may promote the tumor progression via activating inflammation, metastasis associated pathways. When referring to histological types, the mucinous colon cancers perhaps increased the invasion and metastasis through distinct mechanisms in different tumor locations. For mucinous cancer located in right-sided colon, the mucinous specific DEPs were mainly associated with ECM-related remodeling and the IL-17 signal pathway. For mucinous cancer located in left-sided colon, the mucinous specific DEPs showed a strong relationship with ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis. The proteomics profiles of colon cancers showed distinct differences related to locations and histological types. These results suggested a distinct mechanism underlying the diverse subtypes of colon cancers.
PXD028048	34590677	Cryo-EM structure of the monomeric Rhodobacter sphaeroides RC-LH1 core complex at 2.5 Aa. 	Structural characterization of the reaction center-light harvesting 1-PufXY complex from Rhodobacter sphaeroides	Rhodobacter sphaeroides, photosynthesis, purple bacteria, reaction center light-harvesting-1-PufXY complex	Reaction centre light-harvesting 1 (RC-LH1) complexes are the essential components of bacterial photosynthesis. The membrane-intrinsic LH1 complex absorbs light and the energy migrates to an enclosed RC where a succession of electron and proton transfers conserves the energy as a quinol, which is exported to the cytochrome bc1 complex. In some RC-LH1 variants quinols can diffuse through small pores in a fully circular, 16-subunit LH1 ring, while in others missing LH1 subunits create a gap for quinol export. We used cryogenic electron microscopy to obtain a 2.5 Aa resolution structure of one such RC-LH1, a monomeric complex from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The structure shows that the RC is partly enclosed by a 14-subunit LH1 ring in which each alphabeta heterodimer binds two bacteriochlorophylls and, unusually for currently reported complexes, two carotenoids rather than one. Although the extra carotenoids confer an advantage in terms of photoprotection and light harvesting, they could impede passage of quinones through small, transient pores in the LH1 ring, necessitating a mechanism to create a dedicated quinone channel. The structure shows that two transmembrane proteins play a part in stabilising an open ring structure; one of these components, the PufX polypeptide, is augmented by a hitherto undescribed protein subunit we designate as protein-Y, which lies against the transmembrane regions of the thirteenth and fourteenth LH1alpha polypeptides. Protein-Y prevents LH1 subunits 11-14 adjacent to the RC QB site from bending inwards towards the RC and, with PufX preventing complete encirclement of the RC, this pair of polypeptides ensures unhindered quinone diffusion.
PXD025931	34591612	A protein interaction landscape of breast cancer. 	The protein interaction landscape of breast cancer	breast cancer, ph, ub	Cancers have been associated with a diverse array of genomic alterations. To help mechanistically understand such alterations in breast-invasive carcinoma, we applied affinity purification-mass spectrometry to delineate comprehensive biophysical interaction networks for 40 frequently altered breast cancer (BC) proteins, with and without relevant mutations, across three human breast cell lines. These networks identify cancer-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs), interconnected and enriched for common and rare cancer mutations, that are substantially rewired by the introduction of key BC mutations. Our analysis identified BPIFA1 and SCGB2A1 as PIK3CA-interacting proteins, which repress PI3K-AKT signaling, and uncovered USP28 and UBE2N as functionally relevant interactors of BRCA1. We also show that the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit spinophilin interacts with and regulates dephosphorylation of BRCA1 to promote DNA double-strand break repair. Thus, PPI landscapes provide a powerful framework for mechanistically interpreting disease genomic data and can identify valuable therapeutic targets.
PXD027617	34592107	Targeted Protein Acetylation in Cells Using Heterobifunctional Molecules. 	Targeted Protein Acetylation in Cells Using Heterobifunctional Molecules	acetylproteomics, heterobifunctional molecules, p300/CBP, targeted acetylation	Protein acetylation is a central event in orchestrating diverse cellular processes. However, current strategies to investigate protein acetylation in cells are often nonspecific or lack temporal and magnitude control. Here, we developed an acetylation tagging system, AceTAG, to induce acetylation of targeted proteins. The AceTAG system utilizes bifunctional molecules to direct the lysine acetyltransferase p300/CBP to proteins fused with the small protein tag FKBP12(F36V), resulting in their induced acetylation. Using AceTAG, we induced targeted acetylation of a diverse array of proteins in cells, specifically histone H3.3, the NF-kappaB subunit p65/RelA, and the tumor suppressor p53. We demonstrate that targeted acetylation with the AceTAG system is rapid, selective, reversible and can be controlled in a dose-dependent fashion. AceTAG represents a useful strategy to modulate protein acetylation and should enable the exploration of targeted acetylation in basic biological and therapeutic contexts.
PXD022383	34592149	ULK1 phosphorylation of striatin activates protein phosphatase 2A and autophagy. 	ULK1 regulated phosphatases in mouse and human cells	A549, MEFs, SILAC, autophagy, chemical proteomics	The evolutionarily conserved ULK1 kinase complex acts as gatekeeper of canonical autophagy and regulates induction of autophagosome biogenesis. To better understand control of ULK1 and analyze whether ULK1 has broader functions that are also linked to the later steps of autophagy, we perform comprehensive phosphoproteomic analyses. Combining in vivo with in vitro data, we identify numerous direct ULK1 target sites within autophagy-relevant proteins that are critical for autophagosome maturation and turnover. In addition, we highlight an intimate crosstalk between ULK1 and several phosphatase complexes. ULK1 is not only a PP2A target but also directly phosphorylates the regulatory PP2A subunit striatin, activating PP2A and serving as positive feedback to promote autophagy-dependent protein turnover. Thus, ULK1 and phosphatase activities are tightly coordinated to robustly regulate protein degradation by autophagy.

Structural mapping of the surfaces of fibrillar 1N3R and 1N4R human tau	NHS-Biotin, Structural proteomics, chemical surface modification, nanoLC-MSMS, proteolysis, tau fibrils	The rigid core of intracellular tau filaments from Alzheimer's disease (AD), Pick's disease (PiD), and Corticobasal disease (CBD) brains has been shown to differ in their cryo-EM atomic structure. Despite providing critical information on the intimate arrangement of a fraction of htau molecule within the fibrillar scaffold, the cryo-EM studies neither yield a complete picture of tau fibrillar assemblies structure nor contribute insights into the surfaces that define their interactions with numerous cellular components. Here, using proteomic approaches such as proteolysis and molecular covalent painting, we mapped the exposed amino acid stretches at the surface and those constituting the fibrillar core of in vitro-assembled fibrils of human htau containing one N-terminal domain and three (1N3R) or four (1N4R) C-terminal microtubule-binding repeat domains as a result of alternative splicing. Using limited proteolysis, we identified the proteolytic fragments composing the molecular "bar-code" for each type of fibril. Our results are in agreement with structural data reported for filamentous tau from AD, PiD, and CBD cases predigested with the protease pronase. Finally, we report two amino acid stretches, exposed to the solvent in 1N4R not in 1N3R htau, which distinguish the surfaces of these two kinds of fibrils. Our findings open new perspectives for the design of highly specific ligands with diagnostic and therapeutic potential.
PXD027454	34592425	A Novel Spectral Annotation Strategy Streamlines Reporting of Mono-ADP-ribosylated Peptides Derived from Mouse Liver and Spleen in Response to IFN-gamma. 	A Novel Spectral Annotation Strategy Streamlines Reporting of mono-ADP-ribosylated Peptides Derived from Mouse Liver and Spleen in Response to IFN-gamma	ADP-ribosylation, IFN-gamma, Liver, Software, Spleen	Mass-spectrometry-enabled ADP-ribosylation workflows are developing rapidly, providing researchers a variety of ADP-ribosylome enrichment strategies and mass spectrometric acquisition options. Despite the growth spurt in upstream technologies, systematic ADP-ribosyl (ADPr) peptide mass spectral annotation methods are lacking. HCD-dependent ADP-ribosylome studies are common, but the resulting MS2 spectra are complex, owing to a mixture of b/y-ions and the m/p-ion peaks representing one or more dissociation events of the ADPr moiety (m-ion) and peptide (p-ion). In particular, p-ions that dissociate further into one or more fragment ions can dominate HCD spectra but are not recognized by standard spectral annotation workflows. As a result, annotation strategies that are solely reliant upon the b/y-ions result in lower spectral scores that in turn reduce the number of reportable ADPr peptides. To improve the confidence of spectral assignments, we implemented an ADPr peptide annotation and scoring strategy. All MS2 spectra are scored for the ADPr m-ions, but once spectra are assigned as an ADPr peptide, they are further annotated and scored for the p-ions. We implemented this novel workflow to ADPr peptides enriched from the liver and spleen isolated from mice post 4 h exposure to systemic IFN-gamma. HCD collision energy experiments were first performed on the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos and the Q Exactive, with notable ADPr peptide dissociation properties verified with CID (Lumos). The m-ion and p-ion series score distributions revealed that ADPr peptide dissociation properties vary markedly between instruments and within instrument collision energy settings, with consequences on ADPr peptide reporting and amino acid localization. Consequentially, we increased the number of reportable ADPr peptides by 25% (liver) and 17% (spleen) by validation and the inclusion of lower confidence ADPr peptide spectra. This systematic annotation strategy will streamline future reporting of ADPr peptides that have been sequenced using any HCD/CID-based method.
PXD023078	34593797	Chromatin accessibility associates with protein-RNA correlation in human cancer. 	A chromatin basis for protein-RNA correlation in human cancer	Human cancer, proteomics MS/MS, systems biology	Although alterations in chromatin structure are known to exist in tumors, how these alterations relate to molecular phenotypes in cancer remains to be demonstrated. Multi-omics profiling of human tumors can provide insight into how alterations in chromatin structure are propagated through the pathway of gene expression to result in malignant protein expression. We applied multi-omics profiling of chromatin accessibility, RNA abundance, and protein abundance to 36 human thyroid cancer primary tumors, metastases, and patient-match normal tissue. Through quantification of chromatin accessibility associated with active transcription units and global protein expression, we identify a local chromatin structure that is highly correlated with coordinated RNA and protein expression. In particular, we identify enhancers located within gene-bodies as predictive of correlated RNA and protein expression, that is independent of overall transcriptional activity. To demonstrate the generalizability of these findings we also identify similar results in an independent cohort of human breast cancers. Taken together, these analyses suggest that local enhancers, rather than distal enhancers, are likely most predictive of cancer gene expression phenotypes. This allows for identification of potential targets for cancer therapeutic approaches and reinforces the utility of multi-omics profiling as a methodology to understand human disease.
PXD027411	34594315	The Binary Toxin of Clostridioides difficile Alters the Proteome and Phosphoproteome of HEp-2 Cells. 	The Binary Toxin of Clostridioides difficile Alters the Proteome and Phosphoproteome of HEp-2 Cells	CDT, Clostridioides difficile, Phosphoproteomics, TMT	Clostridioides difficile is a major cause of nosocomial infection worldwide causing antibiotic-associated diarrhea and some cases are leading to pseudomembranous colitis. The main virulence factors are toxin A and toxin B. Hypervirulent strains of C. difficile are linked to higher mortality rates and most of these strains produce additionally the C. difficile binary toxin (CDT) that possesses two subunits, CDTa and CDTb. The latter is responsible for binding and transfer of CDTa into the cytoplasm of target cells; CDTa is an ADP ribosyltransferase catalyzing the modification of actin fibers that disturbs the actin vs microtubule balance and induces microtubule-based protrusions of the cell membrane increasing the adherence of C. difficile. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Thus, we performed a screening experiment using MS-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics techniques. Epithelial Hep-2 cells were treated with CDTa and CDTb in a multiplexed study for 4 and 8 h. Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using affinity chromatography with TiO2 and Fe-NTA; for quantification, a TMT-based approach and DDA measurements were used. More than 4,300 proteins and 5,600 phosphosites were identified and quantified at all time points. Although only moderate changes were observed on proteome level, the phosphorylation level of nearly 1,100 phosphosites responded to toxin treatment. The data suggested that CSNK2A1 might act as an effector kinase after treatment with CDT. Additionally, we confirmed ADP-ribosylation on Arg-177 of actin and the kinetic of this modification for the first time.
PXD023214	34594319	Identification of Four Secreted Aspartic Protease-Like Proteins Associated With Sophorolipids Synthesis in Starmerella bombicola CGMCC 1576. 	Proteomics analysis of fermentation broth under different nitrogen sources in Starmerella bombicola	Starmerella bombicola, nitrogen sources	The non-pathogenic yeast Starmerella bombicola CGMCC 1576 is an efficient producer of sophorolipids (SLs). The lactonic SLs are mainly produced with yeast extract, and the acidic SLs are mainly produced with ammonium sulfate. Naturally produced SLs are a mixture of various lactonic and acidic SLs. Usually, the SL mixture is not well separated technically, and the separation cost is relatively high. In order to reduce the cost of separation, four secreted aspartic protease-like proteins were identified through proteomic analysis of fermentation broth of S. bombicola under different nitrogen source conditions. The coding genes of the four proteins, namely, sapl1, sapl2, sapl3, and sapl4, are of high sequence similarity (above 55%) and included in a gene cluster. The expression of the four genes was significantly upregulated on (NH4)2SO4 compared with that on yeast extract. The four genes were deleted together to generate a strain Deltasapl. The titer of SLs in Deltasapl reached 60.71 g/L after 5 days of fermentation using (NH4)2SO4 as the nitrogen source and increased by 90% compared with the wild-type strain. The concentration of acidic SLs was 55.84 g/L, accounting for 92% of the total SLs. The yield of SLs from glucose (g/g) by Deltasapl was 0.78, much higher than that by wild-type strain (0.47). However, no increase of SLs production was observed in Deltasapl under yeast extract condition. Compared with that of the wild-type strain, the expression levels of the key genes for SLs synthesis were all upregulated to varying degrees in Deltasapl under (NH4)2SO4 conditions, and particularly, the expression level of ugta1 encoding UDP glucosyltransferase was upregulated by 14.3-fold. The results suggest that the sapl gene cluster is negatively involved in the production of SLs in the case of (NH4)2SO4 by restraining the expression of the key genes involved in SLs synthesis. The Deltasapl strain is an excellent producer of high-titer and high-yield acidic SLs.
PXD025173	34596797	Atypical activation of signaling downstream of inactivated Bcr-Abl mediates chemoresistance in chronic myeloid leukemia. 	iTRAQ analysis of K562 cell line	K562, iTRAQ	Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) epitomises successful targeted therapy, where inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of oncoprotein Bcr-Abl1 by imatinib, induces remission in 86% patients in initial chronic phase (CP). However, in acute phase of blast crisis, 80% patients show resistance, 40% among them despite inhibition of Bcr-Abl1 activity. This implies activation of either Bcr-Abl1- independent signalling pathways or restoration of signalling downstream of inactive Bcr-Abl1. In the present study, mass spectrometry and subsequent in silico pathway analysis of differentiators in resistant CML-CP cells identified key differentiators, 14-3-3epsilon and p38 MAPK, which belong to Bcr-Abl1 pathway. Their levels and activity respectively, indicated active Bcr-Abl1 pathway in CML-BC resistant cells, though Bcr-Abl1 is inhibited by imatinib. Further, contribution of these components to resistance was demonstrated by inhibition of Bcr-Abl1 down-stream signalling by knocking-out of 14-3-3epsilon and inhibition of p38 MAPK activity. The observations merit clinical validation to explore their translational potential.
PXD011757	34597184	Chronic Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide induces adverse myocardial infarction wound healing through activation of CD8(+) T cells. 	Tc1 and Tc2 secretion proteome evaluation	Tc1 and Tc2 secretion	Oral and gum health have long been associated with incidence and outcomes of cardiovascular disease. Periodontal disease increases myocardial infarction (MI) mortality by sevenfold through mechanisms that are not fully understood. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from a periodontal pathogen accelerates inflammation after MI through memory T-cell activation. We compared four groups [no MI, chronic LPS, day 1 after MI, and day 1 after MI with chronic LPS (LPS + MI); n = 68 mice] using the mouse heart attack research tool 1.0 database and tissue bank coupled with new analyses and experiments. LPS + MI increased total CD8(+) T cells in the left ventricle versus the other groups (P < 0.05 vs. all). Memory CD8(+) T cells (CD44( + )CD27(+)) were 10-fold greater in LPS + MI than in MI alone (P = 0.02). Interleukin (IL)-4 stimulated splenic CD8(+) T cells away from an effector phenotype and toward a memory phenotype, inducing secretion of factors associated with the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that promoted monocyte migration and decreased viability. To dissect the effect of CD8(+) T cells after MI, we administered a major histocompatibility complex-I-blocking antibody starting 7 days before MI, which prevented effector CD8(+) T-cell activation without affecting the memory response. The reduction in effector cells diminished infarct wall thinning but had no effect on macrophage numbers or MertK expression. LPS + MI + IgG attenuated macrophages within the infarct without effecting CD8(+) T cells, suggesting these two processes were independent. Overall, our data indicate that effector and memory CD8(+) T cells at post-MI day 1 are amplified by chronic LPS to potentially promote infarct wall thinning.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although there is a well-documented link between periodontal disease and heart health, the mechanisms are unclear. Our study indicates that in response to circulating periodontal endotoxins, memory CD8(+) T cells are activated, resulting in an acceleration of macrophage-mediated inflammation after MI. Blocking activation of effector CD8(+) T cells had no effect on the macrophage numbers or wall thinning at post-MI day 1, indicating that this response was likely due in part to memory CD8(+) T cells.
PXD023239	34597346	The proximal proteome of 17 SARS-CoV-2 proteins links to disrupted antiviral signaling and host translation. 	The proximal proteome of 17 SARS-CoV-2 proteins links to disrupted host antiviral signaling and translation	BioID, Covid-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, Proximity labeling, Sars-cov-2	Viral proteins localize within subcellular compartments to subvert host machinery and promote pathogenesis. To study SARS-CoV-2 biology, we generated an atlas of 2422 human proteins vicinal to 17 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins using proximity proteomics. This identified viral proteins at specific intracellular locations, such as association of accessary proteins with intracellular membranes, and projected SARS-CoV-2 impacts on innate immune signaling, ER-Golgi transport, and protein translation. It identified viral protein adjacency to specific host proteins whose regulatory variants are linked to COVID-19 severity, including the TRIM4 interferon signaling regulator which was found proximal to the SARS-CoV-2 M protein. Viral NSP1 protein adjacency to the EIF3 complex was associated with inhibited host protein translation whereas ORF6 localization with MAVS was associated with inhibited RIG-I 2CARD-mediated IFNB1 promoter activation. Quantitative proteomics identified candidate host targets for the NSP5 protease, with specific functional cleavage sequences in host proteins CWC22 and FANCD2. This data resource identifies host factors proximal to viral proteins in living human cells and nominates pathogenic mechanisms employed by SARS-CoV-2.
PXD022465	34598978	Multiomics reveal unique signatures of human epiploic adipose tissue related to systemic insulin resistance. 	Characterization of epiploic adipose tissue	Adipose tissue, Type-2-Diabetes, epiploic adipose tissue, multi-omics, obesity	OBJECTIVE: Human white adipose tissue (AT) is a metabolically active organ with distinct depot-specific functions. Despite their locations close to the gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric AT and epiploic AT (epiAT) have only scarcely been investigated. Here, we aim to characterise these ATs in-depth and estimate their contribution to alterations in whole-body metabolism. DESIGN: Mesenteric, epiploic, omental and abdominal subcutaneous ATs were collected from 70 patients with obesity undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The metabolically well-characterised cohort included nine subjects with insulin sensitive (IS) obesity, whose AT samples were analysed in a multiomics approach, including methylome, transcriptome and proteome along with samples from subjects with insulin resistance (IR) matched for age, sex and body mass index (n=9). Findings implying differences between AT depots in these subgroups were validated in the entire cohort (n=70) by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: While mesenteric AT exhibited signatures similar to those found in the omental depot, epiAT was distinct from all other studied fat depots. Multiomics allowed clear discrimination between the IS and IR states in all tissues. The highest discriminatory power between IS and IR was seen in epiAT, where profound differences in the regulation of developmental, metabolic and inflammatory pathways were observed. Gene expression levels of key molecules involved in AT function, metabolic homeostasis and inflammation revealed significant depot-specific differences with epiAT showing the highest expression levels. CONCLUSION: Multi-omics epiAT signatures reflect systemic IR and obesity subphenotypes distinct from other fat depots. Our data suggest a previously unrecognised role of human epiploic fat in the context of obesity, impaired insulin sensitivity and related diseases.
PXD033935	34599019	Natural and cryptic peptides dominate the immunopeptidome of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors. 	Natural and cryptic peptides dominate the immunopeptidome of atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors.	HLA-I and HLA-II, primary AT/RT tumors	BACKGROUND: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) are highly aggressive CNS tumors of infancy and early childhood. Hallmark is the surprisingly simple genome with inactivating mutations or deletions in the SMARCB1 gene as the oncogenic driver. Nevertheless, AT/RTs are infiltrated by immune cells and even clonally expanded T cells. However, it is unclear which epitopes T cells might recognize on AT/RT cells. METHODS: Here, we report a comprehensive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of naturally presented human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II ligands on 23 AT/RTs. MS data were validated by matching with a human proteome dataset and exclusion of peptides that are part of the human benignome. Cryptic peptide ligands were identified using Peptide-PRISM. RESULTS: Comparative HLA ligandome analysis of the HLA ligandome revealed 55 class I and 139 class II tumor-exclusive peptides. No peptide originated from the SMARCB1 region. In addition, 61 HLA class I tumor-exclusive peptide sequences derived from non-canonically translated proteins. Combination of peptides from natural and cryptic class I and class II origin gave optimal representation of tumor cell compartments. Substantial overlap existed with the cryptic immunopeptidome of glioblastomas, but no concordance was found with extracranial tumors. More than 80% of AT/RT exclusive peptides were able to successfully prime CD8(+) T cells, whereas naturally occurring memory responses in AT/RT patients could only be detected for class II epitopes. Interestingly, >50% of AT/RT exclusive class II ligands were also recognized by T cells from glioblastoma patients but not from healthy donors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight that AT/RTs, potentially paradigmatic for other pediatric tumors with a low mutational load, present a variety of highly immunogenic HLA class I and class II peptides from canonical as well as non-canonical protein sources. Inclusion of such cryptic peptides into therapeutic vaccines would enable an optimized mapping of the tumor cell surface, thereby reducing the likelihood of immune evasion.
PXD027915	34599168	SPOP mutation induces replication over-firing by impairing Geminin ubiquitination and triggers replication catastrophe upon ATR inhibition. 	SPOP mutation induces replication over-firing by impairing Geminin ubiquitination and triggers replication catastrophe upon ATR inhibition	Geminin coIP-mass spec, Geminin ubiquitin modification site mapping	Geminin and its binding partner Cdt1 are essential for the regulation of DNA replication. Here we show that the CULLIN3 E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein SPOP binds Geminin at endogenous level and regulates DNA replication. SPOP promotes K27-linked non-degradative poly-ubiquitination of Geminin at lysine residues 100 and 127. This poly-ubiquitination of Geminin prevents DNA replication over-firing by indirectly blocking the association of Cdt1 with the MCM protein complex, an interaction required for DNA unwinding and replication. SPOP is frequently mutated in certain human cancer types and implicated in tumorigenesis. We show that cancer-associated SPOP mutations impair Geminin K27-linked poly-ubiquitination and induce replication origin over-firing and re-replication. The replication stress caused by SPOP mutations triggers replication catastrophe and cell death upon ATR inhibition. Our results reveal a tumor suppressor role of SPOP in preventing DNA replication over-firing and genome instability and suggest that SPOP-mutated tumors may be susceptible to ATR inhibitor therapy.
PXD021650	34599184	Rett syndrome linked to defects in forming the MeCP2/Rbfox/LASR complex in mouse models. 	Identification of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) interacting proteins in the high molecular weight (HMW) extract prepared from the human HEK293T cells by immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry analysis	IP mass spectrometry	Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurological disorder and a leading cause of intellectual disability in young females. RTT is mainly caused by mutations found in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanism underlying RTT pathogenesis is still poorly understood. Here, we report MeCP2 as a key subunit of a higher-order multiunit protein complex Rbfox/LASR. Defective MeCP2 in RTT mouse models disrupts the assembly of the MeCP2/Rbfox/LASR complex, leading to reduced binding of Rbfox proteins to target pre-mRNAs and aberrant splicing of Nrxns and Nlgn1 critical for synaptic plasticity. We further show that MeCP2 disease mutants display defective condensate properties and fail to promote phase-separated condensates with Rbfox proteins in vitro and in cultured cells. These data link an impaired function of MeCP2 with disease mutation in splicing control to its defective properties in mediating the higher-order assembly of the MeCP2/Rbfox/LASR complex.
PXD023546	34599227	Time-gated Raman spectroscopy and proteomics analyses of hypoxic and normoxic renal carcinoma extracellular vesicles. 	Renal Cell Carcinoma (Renca) Extracellular Vesicles under Hypoxia and Normoxia	Carcinoma, Extracellular Vesisles, Kidney, LC-MS	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent a diverse group of small membrane-encapsulated particles involved in cell-cell communication, but the technologies to characterize EVs are still limited. Hypoxia is a typical condition in solid tumors, and cancer-derived EVs support tumor growth and invasion of tissues by tumor cells. We found that exposure of renal adenocarcinoma cells to hypoxia induced EV secretion and led to notable changes in the EV protein cargo in comparison to normoxia. Proteomics analysis showed overrepresentation of proteins involved in adhesion, such as integrins, in hypoxic EV samples. We further assessed the efficacy of time-gated Raman spectroscopy (TG-RS) and surface-enhanced time-gated Raman spectroscopy (TG-SERS) to characterize EVs. While the conventional continuous wave excitation Raman spectroscopy did not provide a notable signal, prominent signals were obtained with the TG-RS that were further enhanced in the TG-SERS. The Raman signal showed characteristic changes in the amide regions due to alteration in the chemical bonds of the EV proteins. The results illustrate that the TG-RS and the TG-SERS are promising label free technologies to study cellular impact of external stimuli, such as oxygen deficiency, on EV production, as well as differences arising from distinct EV purification protocols.
PXD026625	34600154	The global proteome and ubiquitinome of bacterial and viral co-infected bronchial epithelial cells. 	The global Proteome and Ubiquitinome of bacterial and viral co-infected Bronchial Epithelial Cells	16HBE, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, co-infection, influenza A virus	Viral infections facilitate bacterial trafficking to the lower respiratory tract resulting in bacterial-viral co-infections. Bacterial dissemination to the lower respiratory tract is enhanced by influenza A virus induced epithelial cell damage and dysregulation of immune responses. Epithelial cells act as a line of defense and detect pathogens by a high variety of pattern recognition receptors. The post-translational modification ubiquitin is involved in almost every cellular process. Moreover, ubiquitination contributes to the regulation of host immune responses, influenza A virus uncoating and transport within host cells. We applied proteomics with a special focus on ubiquitination to assess the impact of single bacterial and viral as well as bacterial-viral co-infections on bronchial epithelial cells. We used Tandem Ubiquitin Binding Entities to enrich polyubiquitinated proteins and assess changes in the ubiquitinome. Infecting 16HBE cells with Streptococcus pyogenes led to an increased abundance of proteins related to mitochondrial translation and energy metabolism in proteome and ubiquitinome. In contrast, influenza A virus infection mainly altered the ubiquitinome. Co-infections had no additional impact on protein abundances or affected pathways. Changes in protein abundance and enriched pathways were assigned to imprints of both infecting pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE: Viral and bacterial co-infections of the lower respiratory tract are a burden for health systems worldwide. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the complex interplay between the host and the infecting pathogens. Thus, we analyzed the proteome and the ubiquitinome of co-infected bronchial epithelial cells to elaborate a potential synergism of the two infecting organisms. The results presented in this work can be used as a starting point for further analyses.
PXD022143	34600886	The deubiquitinase USP11 is a versatile and conserved regulator of autophagy. 	Versatile regulation of autophagy by the deubiquitinase USP11	USP11, Ubiquitination, autophagy	Autophagy is a major cellular quality control system responsible for the degradation of proteins and organelles in response to stress and damage to maintain homeostasis. Ubiquitination of autophagy-related proteins or regulatory components is important for the precise control of autophagy pathways. Here, we show that the deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) restricts autophagy and that KO of USP11 in mammalian cells results in elevated autophagic flux. We also demonstrate that depletion of the USP11 homolog H34C03.2 in Caenorhabditis elegans triggers hyperactivation of autophagy and protects the animals against human amyloid-beta peptide 42 aggregation-induced paralysis. USP11 coprecipitated with autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I and limited its interaction with nuclear receptor-binding factor 2, thus decreasing lipid kinase activity of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I and subsequent recruitment of effectors such as WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting proteins to the autophagosomal membrane. Accordingly, more WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 2 puncta accumulated in USP11 KO cells. In addition, USP11 interacts with and stabilizes the serine/threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin, thereby further contributing to the regulation of autophagy induction. Taken together, our data suggested that USP11 impinges on the autophagy pathway at multiple sites and that inhibiting USP11 alleviates symptoms of proteotoxicity, which is a major hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases.
PXD026822	34601133	Extracellular vesicle-mediated communication between hepatocytes and natural killer cells promotes hepatocellular tumorigenesis. 	Extracellular vesicle-mediated communication between hepatocytes and natural killer cells promotes hepatocellular tumorigenesis	Extracellular vesicle	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is frequently characterized by metabolic and immune remodeling in the tumor microenvironment. We previously discovered that liver-specific deletion of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1), a gluconeogenic enzyme ubiquitously suppressed in HCC tissues, promotes liver tumorigenesis and induces metabolic and immune perturbations closely resembling human HCC. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we reported that FBP1-deficient livers exhibit diminished amounts of natural killer (NK) cells and accelerated tumorigenesis. Using the diethylnitrosamine-induced HCC mouse model, we analyzed potential changes in the immune cell populations purified from control and FBP1-depleted livers and found that NK cells were strongly suppressed. Mechanistically, FBP1 attenuation in hepatocytes derepresses an zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-dependent transcriptional program to inhibit PKLR expression. This leads to reduced levels of PKLR cargo proteins sorted into hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), dampened activity of EV-targeted NK cells, and accelerated liver tumorigenesis. Our study demonstrated that hepatic FBP1 depletion promotes HCC-associated immune remodeling, partly through the transfer of hepatocyte-secreted, PKLR-attenuated EVs to NK cells.
PXD026223	34603285	Quantitative Analyses Reveal How Hypoxia Reconfigures the Proteome of Primary Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes. 	The impact of hypoxia on the cytotoxic T lymphocyte proteome	CD8 T cells, CTLs, Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, Hypoxia, oxygen sensing	Metabolic and nutrient-sensing pathways play an important role in controlling the efficacy of effector T cells. Oxygen is a critical regulator of cellular metabolism. However, during immune responses T cells must function in oxygen-deficient, or hypoxic, environments. Here, we used high resolution mass spectrometry to investigate how the proteome of primary murine CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is reconfigured in response to hypoxia in vitro. We identified and quantified over 7,600 proteins and discovered that hypoxia increased the abundance of a selected number of proteins in CTLs. This included glucose transporters, metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, cytolytic effector molecules, checkpoint receptors and adhesion molecules. While some of these proteins may augment the effector functions of CTLs, others may limit their cytotoxicity. Moreover, we determined that hypoxia could inhibit IL-2-induced proliferation cues and antigen-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in CTLs. These data provide a comprehensive resource for understanding the magnitude of the CTL response to hypoxia and emphasise the importance of oxygen-sensing pathways for controlling CD8(+) T cells. Additionally, this study provides new understanding about how hypoxia may promote the effector function of CTLs, while contributing to their dysfunction in some contexts.
PXD027095	34603364	Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Thermomorphogenic Responses in Arabidopsis. 	Phosphoproteomic analysis of thermomorphogenic responses in Arabidopsis	Hypocotyl growth, Phosphoproteomics, Thermomorphogenesis, Warm Temperature	Plants rapidly adapt to elevated ambient temperature by adjusting their growth and developmental programs. To date, a number of experiments have been carried out to understand how plants sense and respond to warm temperatures. However, how warm temperature signals are relayed from thermosensors to transcriptional regulators is largely unknown. To identify new early regulators of plant thermo-responsiveness, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis using TMT (Tandem Mass Tags) labeling and phosphopeptide enrichment with Arabidopsis etiolated seedlings treated with or without 3h of warm temperatures (29degreesC). In total, we identified 13,160 phosphopeptides in 5,125 proteins with 10,700 quantifiable phosphorylation sites. Among them, 200 sites (180 proteins) were upregulated, while 120 sites (87 proteins) were downregulated by elevated temperature. GO (Gene Ontology) analysis indicated that phosphorelay-related molecular function was enriched among the differentially phosphorylated proteins. We selected ATL6 (ARABIDOPSIS TOXICOS EN LEVADURA 6) from them and expressed its native and phosphorylation-site mutated (S343A S357A) forms in Arabidopsis and found that the mutated form of ATL6 was less stable than that of the native form both in vivo and in cell-free degradation assays. Taken together, our data revealed extensive protein phosphorylation during thermo-responsiveness, providing new candidate proteins/genes for studying plant thermomorphogenesis in the future.
PXD027202	34603392	Development and Initial Characterization of Cellular Models for COG Complex-Related CDG-II Diseases. 	Development and initial characterization of cellular models for COG complexrelated CDG-II diseases	COG complex, CRISPR, Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, Golgi apparatus, glycan processing, glycosylation, mass-spectrometry, vesicle tethering	Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) is an octameric protein complex that orchestrates intra-Golgi trafficking of glycosylation enzymes. Over a hundred individuals with 31 different COG mutations have been identified until now. The cellular phenotypes and clinical presentations of COG-CDGs are heterogeneous, and patients primarily represent neurological, skeletal, and hepatic abnormalities. The establishment of a cellular COG disease model will benefit the molecular study of the disease, explaining the detailed sequence of the interplay between the COG complex and the trafficking machinery. Moreover, patient fibroblasts are not a good representative of all the organ systems and cell types that are affected by COG mutations. We developed and characterized cellular models for human COG4 mutations, specifically in RPE1 and HEK293T cell lines. Using a combination of CRISPR/Cas9 and lentiviral transduction technologies, both myc-tagged wild-type and mutant (G516R and R729W) COG4 proteins were expressed under the endogenous COG4 promoter. Constructed isogenic cell lines were comprehensively characterized using biochemical, microscopy (superresolution and electron), and proteomics approaches. The analysis revealed similar stability and localization of COG complex subunits, wild-type cell growth, and normal Golgi morphology in all three cell lines. Importantly, COG4-G516R cells demonstrated increased HPA-647 binding to the plasma membrane glycoconjugates, while COG4-R729W cells revealed high GNL-647 binding, indicating specific defects in O- and N-glycosylation. Both mutant cell lines express an elevated level of heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Moreover, a quantitative mass-spectrometry analysis of proteins secreted by COG-deficient cell lines revealed abnormal secretion of SIL1 and ERGIC-53 proteins by COG4-G516R cells. Interestingly, the clinical phenotype of patients with congenital mutations in the SIL1 gene (Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome) overlaps with the phenotype of COG4-G516R patients (Saul-Wilson syndrome). Our work is the first compressive study involving the creation of different COG mutations in different cell lines other than the patient's fibroblast. It may help to address the underlying cause of the phenotypic defects leading to the discovery of a proper treatment guideline for COG-CDGs.
PXD025429	34603401	Proteomic Response of Rat Pituitary Under Chronic Mild Stress Reveals Insights Into Vulnerability and Resistance to Anxiety or Depression. 	Pituitary proteomic response to CMS	anxiety, chronic mild stress, depression, rat pituitary	Chronic stress as one of the most significant risk factor can trigger overactivity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in depression as well as anxiety. Yet, the shared and unique neurobiological underpinnings underlying the pituitary abnormality in these two disorders have not been made clear. We previously have established depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible and insusceptible groups using a valid chronic mild stress (CMS) model. In this work, the possible protein expression changes in the rat pituitary of these three groups were continuously investigated through the use of the comparative quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics approaches. The pituitary-proteome analysis identified totally 197 differential proteins as a CMS response. These deregulated proteins were involved in diverse biological functions and significant pathways potentially connected with the three different behavioral phenotypes, likely serving as new investigative protein targets. Afterwards, parallel reaction monitoring-based independent analysis found out that expression alterations in Oxct1, Sec24c, Ppp1cb, Dock1, and Coq3; Lama1, Glb1, Gapdh, Sccpdh, and Renbp; Sephs1, Nup188, Spp1, Prodh1, and Srm were specifically linked to depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible and insusceptible groups, respectively, suggesting that the same CMS had different impacts on the pituitary protein regulatory system. Collectively, the current proteomics research elucidated an important molecular basis and furnished new valuable insights into neurochemical commonalities and specificities of the pituitary dysfunctional mechanisms in HPA axis underlying vulnerability and resistance to stress-induced anxiety or depression.
PXD027302	34604117	Roles and Cellular Localization of GBP2 and NAB2 During the Blood Stage of Malaria Parasites. 	Identification of GBP2- and NAB2-interacting proteins in malaria parasites		The quality control and export of mRNA by RNA-binding proteins are necessary for the survival of malaria parasites, which have complex life cycles. Nuclear poly(A) binding protein 2 (NAB2), THO complex subunit 4 (THO4), nucleolar protein 3 (NPL3), G-strand binding protein 2 (GBP2) and serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SR1) are involved in nuclear mRNA export in malaria parasites. However, their roles in asexual and sexual development, and in cellular localization, are not fully understood. In this study using the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei, we found that NAB2 and SR1, but not THO4, NPL3 or GBP2, played essential roles in the asexual development of malaria parasites. By contrast, GBP2 but not NPL3 was involved in male and female gametocyte production. THO4 was involved in female gametocyte production, but had a lower impact than GBP2. In this study, we focused on GBP2 and NAB2, which play important roles in the sexual and asexual development of malaria parasites, respectively, and examined their cellular localization. GBP2 localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of malaria parasites. Using immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry (IP-MS), GBP2 interacted with the proteins ALBA4, DOZI, and CITH, which play roles in translational repression. IP-MS also revealed that phosphorylated adapter RNA export protein (PHAX) domain-containing protein, an adaptor protein for exportin-1, also interacted with GBP2, implying that mRNA export occurs via the PHAX domain-containing protein pathway in malaria parasites. Live-cell fluorescence imaging revealed that NAB2 localized at the nuclear periphery. Moreover, IP-MS indicated that NAB2 interacted with transportin. RNA immunoprecipitation coupled to RNA sequencing revealed that NAB2 bound directly to 143 mRNAs, including those encoding 40S and 60S ribosomal proteins. Our findings imply that malaria parasites use an evolutionarily ancient mechanism conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution.
PXD027882	34604175	Acetylated Thioredoxin Reductase 1 Resists Oxidative Inactivation. 	Aspirin Acetylates Thioredoxin Reductase 1 (isoform 4)	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Cancer (B/D-HPP), Thioredoxin Reductase, acetylation, aspirin	Thioredoxin Reductase 1 (TrxR1) is an enzyme that protects human cells against reactive oxygen species generated during oxidative stress or in response to chemotherapies. Acetylation of TrxR1 is associated with oxidative stress, but the function of TrxR1 acetylation in oxidizing conditions is unknown. Using genetic code expansion, we produced recombinant and site-specifically acetylated variants of TrxR1 that also contain the non-canonical amino acid, selenocysteine, which is essential for TrxR1 activity. We previously showed site-specific acetylation at three different lysine residues increases TrxR1 activity by reducing the levels of linked dimers and low activity TrxR1 tetramers. Here we use enzymological studies to show that acetylated TrxR1 is resistant to both oxidative inactivation and peroxide-induced multimer formation. To compare the effect of programmed acetylation at specific lysine residues to non-specific acetylation, we produced acetylated TrxR1 using aspirin as a model non-enzymatic acetyl donor. Mass spectrometry confirmed aspirin-induced acetylation at multiple lysine residues in TrxR1. In contrast to unmodified TrxR1, the non-specifically acetylated enzyme showed no loss of activity under increasing and strongly oxidating conditions. Our data suggest that both site-specific and general acetylation of TrxR1 regulate the enzyme's ability to resist oxidative damage.
PXD027232	34604215	SIRT7-Induced PHF5A Decrotonylation Regulates Aging Progress Through Alternative Splicing-Mediated Downregulation of CDK2. 	SIRT7-induced PHF5A de-crotonylation regulates ageing progress through alternative splicing-mediated downregulation of CDK2	Crotonylation, fibroblasts	Dysregulation of protein posttranslational modification (PTM) can lead to a variety of pathological processes, such as abnormal sperm development, malignant tumorigenesis, depression, and aging process. SIRT7 is a NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase. Besides known deacetylation, SIRT7 may also have the capacity to remove other acylation. However, the roles of SIRT7-induced other deacylation in aging are still largely unknown. Here, we found that the expression of SIRT7 was significantly increased in senescent fibroblasts and aged tissues. Knockdown or overexpression of SIRT7 can inhibit or promote fibroblast senescence. Knockdown of SIRT7 led to increased pan-lysine crotonylation (Kcr) levels in senescent fibroblasts. Using modern mass spectrometry (MS) technology, we identified 5,149 Kcr sites across 1,541 proteins in senescent fibroblasts, and providing the largest crotonylome dataset to date in senescent cells. Specifically, among the identified proteins, we found SIRT7 decrotonylated PHF5A, an alternative splicing (AS) factor, at K25. Decrotonylation of PHF5A K25 contributed to decreased CDK2 expression by retained intron (RI)-induced abnormal AS, thereby accelerating fibroblast senescence, and supporting a key role of PHF5A K25 decrotonylation in aging. Collectively, our data revealed the molecular mechanism of SIRT7-induced k25 decrotonylation of PHF5A regulating aging and provide new ideas and molecular targets for drug intervention in cellular aging and the treatment of aging-related diseases, and indicating that protein crotonylation has important implications in the regulation of aging progress.
PXD025729	34604665	Interactome Networks of FOSL1 and FOSL2 in Human Th17 Cells. 	Mapping interactome networks of FOSL1 and FOSL2 in human Th17 cells	Interactomics, Th17 cells	Dysregulated function of Th17 cells has implications in immunodeficiencies and autoimmune disorders. Th17 cell differentiation is orchestrated by a complex network of transcription factors, including several members of the activator protein (AP-1) family. Among the latter, FOSL1 and FOSL2 modulate the effector functions of Th17 cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear, owing to the poorly characterized protein interaction networks of FOSL factors. Here, we establish the first interactomes of FOSL1 and FOSL2 in human Th17 cells, using affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis. In addition to the known JUN proteins, we identified several novel binding partners of FOSL1 and FOSL2. Gene ontology analysis found a significant fraction of these interactors to be associated with RNA-binding activity, which suggests new mechanistic links. Intriguingly, 29 proteins were found to share interactions with FOSL1 and FOSL2, and these included key regulators of Th17 fate. We further validated the binding partners identified in this study by using parallel reaction monitoring targeted mass spectrometry and other methods. Our study provides key insights into the interaction-based signaling mechanisms of FOSL proteins that potentially govern Th17 cell differentiation and associated pathologies.
PXD027190	34604676	Phosphoproteomics Provides Novel Insights into the Response of Primary Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Cells to Microtubule Depolymerization in G1 Phase of the Cell Cycle. 	Phosphoproteomics provides novel insights into the response of primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to microtubule depolymerization in G1 phase of the cell cycle	DNA damage response, Microtubule-targeting agents, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, c-Jun, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, microtubules, palbociclib, phosphoproteomics, vincristine	Microtubule targeting agents (MTAs) have been used for the treatment of cancer for many decades and are among the most successful chemotherapeutic agents. However, their application and effectiveness are limited because of toxicity and resistance as well as a lack of knowledge of molecular mechanisms downstream of microtubule inhibition. Insights into key pathways that link microtubule disruption to cell death is critical for optimal use of these drugs, for defining biomarkers useful in patient stratification, and for informed design of drug combinations. Although MTAs characteristically induce death in mitosis, microtubule destabilizing agents such as vincristine also induce death directly in G1 phase in primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Because many signaling pathways regulating cell survival and death involve changes in protein expression and phosphorylation, we undertook a comprehensive quantitative proteomic study of G1 phase ALL cells treated with vincristine. The results revealed distinct alterations associated with c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling, anti-proliferative signaling, the DNA damage response, and cytoskeletal remodeling. Signals specifically associated with cell death were identified by pre-treatment with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, which caused G1 arrest and precluded death induction. These results provide insights into signaling mechanisms regulating cellular responses to microtubule inhibition and provide a foundation for a better understanding of the clinical mechanisms of MTAs and for the design of novel drug combinations. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the PRIDE Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD027190 and 10.6019/PXD027190.
PXD022970	34605140	PLK1-dependent phosphorylation restrains EBNA2 activity and lymphomagenesis in EBV-infected mice. 	PLK1 phosphorylation of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2	Phosphoproteomics, cancer	While Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes a life-long latent infection in apparently healthy human immunocompetent hosts, immunodeficient individuals are at particular risk to develop lymphoproliferative B-cell malignancies caused by EBV. A key EBV protein is the transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), which initiates B-cell proliferation. Here, we combine biochemical, cellular, and in vivo experiments demonstrating that the mitotic polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) binds to EBNA2, phosphorylates its transactivation domain, and thereby inhibits its biological activity. EBNA2 mutants that impair PLK1 binding or prevent EBNA2 phosphorylation are gain-of-function mutants. They exhibit enhanced transactivation capacities, accelerate the proliferation of infected B cells, and promote the development of monoclonal B-cell lymphomas in infected mice. Thus, PLK1 coordinates the activity of EBNA2 to attenuate the risk of tumor incidences in favor of the establishment of latency in the infected but healthy host.
PXD026574	34605151	Advanced Maternal Age-associated SIRT1 Deficiency Compromises Trophoblast Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition through an Increase in Vimentin Acetylation. 	SIRT1 binding proteins in human first trimester villi and HTR8/SVneo cells	Coimmunoprecipitation, HTR8/SVneo cells, Human villi, SIRT1, Tandem mass spectrometry	Advanced maternal age (AMA) pregnancies are rapidly increasing and are associated with aberrant trophoblast cell function, poor placentation, and unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, presumably due to premature placental senescence. SIRT1 is an NAD(+) -dependent deacetylase with well-known antiaging effects, but its connection with placental senescence is unreported. In this study, human term placentas and first-trimester villi were collected from AMA and normal pregnancies, and a mouse AMA model was established by cross breeding young and aged male and female C57 mice. SIRT1 expression and activity in HTR8/SVneo cells were genetically or pharmacologically manipulated. Trophoblast-specific Sirt1-knockout (KO) mouse placentas were generated by mating Elf5-Cre and Sirt1(fl/fl) mice. Trophoblast cell mobility was assessed with transwell invasion and wound-healing assays. SIRT1-binding proteins in HTR8/SVneo cells and human placental tissue were identified by mass spectrometry. We identified SIRT1 as the only differentially expressed sirtuin between AMA and normal placentas. It is downregulated in AMA placentas early in the placental life cycle and is barely impacted by paternal age. SIRT1 loss upregulates P53 acetylation and P21 expression and impairs trophoblast invasion and migration. Sirt1-KO mouse placentas exhibit senescence markers and morphological disruption, along with decreased fetal weight. In trophoblasts, SIRT1 interacts with vimentin, regulating its acetylation. In conclusion, SIRT1 promotes trophoblast epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to enhance invasiveness by modulating vimentin acetylation. AMA placentas are associated with premature senescence during placentation due to SIRT1 loss. Therefore, SIRT1 may be an antiaging therapeutic target for improving placental development and perinatal outcomes in AMA pregnancies.
PXD022194	34605646	PeptiCHIP: A Microfluidic Platform for Tumor Antigen Landscape Identification. 	Immunopeptidomics by use of a microfluidics chip.	HLA-I, Immunopeptidome, JY cell line, Ligandome, MHC-I, RCC, bladder cancer, chip, microfluidics, ovarian cancer, patient derived organoid, renal cell carcinoma	Identification of HLA class I ligands from the tumor surface (ligandome or immunopeptidome) is essential for designing T-cell mediated cancer therapeutic approaches. However, the sensitivity of the process for isolating MHC-I restricted tumor-specific peptides has been the major limiting factor for reliable tumor antigen characterization, making clear the need for technical improvement. Here, we describe our work from the fabrication and development of a microfluidic-based chip (PeptiCHIP) and its use to identify and characterize tumor-specific ligands on clinically relevant human samples. Specifically, we assessed the potential of immobilizing a pan-HLA antibody on solid surfaces via well-characterized streptavidin-biotin chemistry, overcoming the limitations of the cross-linking chemistry used to prepare the affinity matrix with the desired antibodies in the immunopeptidomics workflow. Furthermore, to address the restrictions related to the handling and the limited availability of tumor samples, we further developed the concept toward the implementation of a microfluidic through-flow system. Thus, the biotinylated pan-HLA antibody was immobilized on streptavidin-functionalized surfaces, and immune-affinity purification (IP) was carried out on customized microfluidic pillar arrays made of thiol-ene polymer. Compared to the standard methods reported in the field, our methodology reduces the amount of antibody and the time required for peptide isolation. In this work, we carefully examined the specificity and robustness of our customized technology for immunopeptidomics workflows. We tested this platform by immunopurifying HLA-I complexes from 1 x 10(6) cells both in a widely studied B-cell line and in patients-derived ex vivo cell cultures, instead of 5 x 10(8) cells as required in the current technology. After the final elution in mild acid, HLA-I-presented peptides were identified by tandem mass spectrometry and further investigated by in vitro methods. These results highlight the potential to exploit microfluidics-based strategies in immunopeptidomics platforms and in personalized immunopeptidome analysis from cells isolated from individual tumor biopsies to design tailored cancer therapeutic vaccines. Moreover, the possibility to integrate multiple identical units on a single chip further improves the throughput and multiplexing of these assays with a view to clinical needs.
PXD016985	34606284	Analysis of Brain Protein Stability Changes in Mouse Models of Normal Aging and alpha-Synucleinopathy Reveals Age- and Disease-Related Differences. 	Analysis of Brain Protein Stability Changes in Mouse Models of Normal Aging and a Synucleinopathy Reveals Age- and Disease-Related Differences	Brain, Parkinsons Disease	Here, we utilize the stability of proteins from rates of oxidation (SPROX) technique, to profile the thermodynamic stabilities of proteins in brain tissue cell lysates from Hualpha-Syn(A53T) transgenic mice at three time points including at 1 month (n = 9), at 6 months (n = 7), and at the time (between 9 and 16 months) a mouse became symptomatic (n = 8). The thermodynamic stability profiles generated here on 332 proteins were compared to thermodynamic stability profiles generated on the same proteins from similarly aged wild-type mice using a two-way unbalanced analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis. This analysis identified a group of 22 proteins with age-related protein stability changes and a group of 11 proteins that were differentially stabilized in the Hualpha-Syn(A53T) transgenic mouse model. A total of 9 of the 11 proteins identified here with disease-related stability changes have been previously detected in human cerebral spinal fluid and thus have potential utility as biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD). The differential stability observed for one protein, glutamate decarboxylase 2 (Gad2), with an age-related change in stability, was consistent with the differential presence of a known, age-related truncation product of this protein, which is shown here to have a higher folding stability than full-length Gad2. Mass spectrometry data were deposited at ProteomeXchange (PXD016985).
PXD027524	34606338	Identification of a Proteasome-Targeting Arylsulfonamide with Potential for the Treatment of Chagas' Disease. 	Ubiquitination in treated T. cruzi parasites	Trypanosoma cruzi, proteasome, ubiquitination	Phenotypic screening identified an arylsulfonamide compound with activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease. Comprehensive mode of action studies revealed that this compound primarily targets the T. cruzi proteasome, binding at the interface between beta4 and beta5 subunits that catalyze chymotrypsin-like activity. A mutation in the beta5 subunit of the proteasome was associated with resistance to compound 1, while overexpression of this mutated subunit also reduced susceptibility to compound 1. Further genetically engineered and in vitro-selected clones resistant to proteasome inhibitors known to bind at the beta4/beta5 interface were cross-resistant to compound 1. Ubiquitinated proteins were additionally found to accumulate in compound 1-treated epimastigotes. Finally, thermal proteome profiling identified malic enzyme as a secondary target of compound 1, although malic enzyme inhibition was not found to drive potency. These studies identify a novel pharmacophore capable of inhibiting the T. cruzi proteasome that may be exploitable for anti-chagasic drug discovery.
PXD025924	34606373	MdaB and NfrA, Two Novel Reductases Important in the Survival and Persistence of the Major Enteropathogen Campylobacter jejuni. 	Campylobacter gene regulation for persistance and survival	Redox cycling, RrpA, RrpB	The paralogues RrpA and RrpB, which are members of the MarR family of DNA binding proteins, are important for the survival of the global bacterial foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni under redox stress. We report that RrpA is a positive regulator of mdaB, encoding a flavin-dependent quinone reductase that contributes to the protection from redox stress mediated by structurally diverse quinones, while RrpB negatively regulates the expression of cj1555c (renamed nfrA for NADPH-flavin reductase A), encoding a flavin reductase. NfrA reduces riboflavin at a greater rate than its derivatives, suggesting that exogenous free flavins are the natural substrate. MdaB and NfrA both prefer NADPH as an electron donor. Cysteine substitution and posttranslational modification analyses indicated that RrpA and RrpB employ a cysteine-based redox switch. Complete genome sequence analyses revealed that mdaB is frequently found in Campylobacter and related Helicobacter spp., while nfrA is predominant in C. jejuni strains. Quinones and flavins are redox cycling agents secreted by a wide range of cell types that can form damaging superoxide by one-electron reactions. We propose a model for stress adaptation where MdaB and NfrA facilitate a two-electron reduction mechanism to the less toxic hydroquinones, thus aiding survival and persistence of this major pathogen. IMPORTANCE Changes in cellular redox potential result in alteration in the oxidation state of intracellular metabolites and enzymes; consequently, cells make adjustments that favor growth and survival. The work we present here answers some of the many questions that have remained elusive over the years of investigation into the enigmatic microaerophile bacterium Campylobacter jejuni. We employed molecular approaches to understand the regulation mechanisms and functional analyses to reveal the roles of two novel quinone and flavin reductases; both serve as major pools of cellular redox-active molecules. This work extends our knowledge on bacterial redox sensing mechanisms and the significance of hemostasis.
PXD027497	34606723	Combined Molecular and Elemental Mass Spectrometry Approaches for Absolute Quantification of Proteomes: Application to the Venomics Characterization of the Two Species of Desert Black Cobras, Walterinnesia aegyptia and Walterinnesia morgani. 	Venomics of the desert black cobra Walterinnesia morgani from Çörten village, Turkey	Walterinnesia morgani, snake venom, venomics	We report a novel hybrid, molecular and elemental mass spectrometry (MS) setup for the absolute quantification of snake venom proteomes shown here for two desert black cobra species within the genus Walterinnesia, Walterinnesia aegyptia and Walterinnesia morgani. The experimental design includes the decomplexation of the venom samples by reverse-phase chromatography independently coupled to four mass spectrometry systems: the combined bottom-up and top-down molecular MS for protein identification and a parallel reverse-phase microbore high-performance liquid chromatograph (RP-muHPLC) on-line to inductively coupled plasma (ICP-MS/MS) elemental mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-QToF MS). This allows to continuously record the absolute sulfur concentration throughout the chromatogram and assign it to the parent venom proteins separated in the RP-muHPLC-ESI-QToF parallel run via mass profiling. The results provide a locus-resolved and quantitative insight into the three desert black cobra venom proteome samples. They also validate the units of measure of our snake venomics strategy for the relative quantification of snake venom proteomes as % of total venom peptide bonds as a proxy for the % by weight of the venom toxins/toxin families. In a more general context, our work may pave the way for broader applications of hybrid elemental/molecular MS setups in diverse areas of proteomics.
PXD028244	34606827	A bioorthogonal chemical reporter for fatty acid synthase-dependent protein acylation. 	A bioorthogonal chemical reporter for fatty acid synthase-dependent protein acylation	N-myristoylation, S-palmitoylation, click chemistry, fatty acid synthase, protein acylation	Mammalian cells acquire fatty acids (FAs) from dietary sources or via de novo palmitate production by fatty acid synthase (FASN). Although most cells express FASN at low levels, it is upregulated in cancers of the breast, prostate, and liver, among others, and is required during the replication of many viruses, such as dengue virus, hepatitis C, HIV-1, hepatitis B, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, among others. The precise role of FASN in disease pathogenesis is poorly understood, and whether de novo FA synthesis contributes to host or viral protein acylation has been traditionally difficult to study. Here, we describe a cell-permeable and click chemistry-compatible alkynyl acetate analog (alkynyl acetic acid or 5-hexynoic acid [Alk-4]) that functions as a reporter of FASN-dependent protein acylation. In an FASN-dependent manner, Alk-4 selectively labels the cellular protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 at its known palmitoylation sites, a process that is essential for the antiviral activity of the protein, and the HIV-1 matrix protein at its known myristoylation site, a process that is required for membrane targeting and particle assembly. Alk-4 metabolic labeling also enabled biotin-based purification and identification of more than 200 FASN-dependent acylated cellular proteins. Thus, Alk-4 is a useful bioorthogonal tool to selectively probe FASN-mediated protein acylation in normal and diseased states.
PXD022886	34608709	Metabolomic and proteomic characterization of sng and pain phenotypes in fibromyalgia. 	Serum proteomics of sng- and pain-trend fibromyalgia patients	Fibromyalgia, serum	BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic widespread pain. Its pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood, and effective diagnosis and treatments are lacking. This study aimed to identify significantly changed biosignatures in FM and propose a novel classification for FM based on pain and soreness (sng) symptoms. METHODS: Urine and serum samples from 30 FM patients and 25 controls underwent metabolomic and proteomic profiling. RESULTS: Compared with controls, FM patients showed significant differential expression of three metabolites in urine and five metabolites and eight proteins in serum. Of them, DETP, 4-guanidinobutanoic acid, SM(d18:1/18:0), PC(20:1(11Z)/18:0), S100A7, SERPINB3, galectin-7 and LYVE1 were first reported as potential biomarkers for FM. Furthermore, lactate, 2-methylmaleate and cotinine in urine and lactate, SM(d18:1/25:1), SM(d18:1/26:1) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and PCYOX1, ITIH4, PFN1, LRG1, C8G, C8A, CP, CDH5 and DBH in serum could differentiate pain- (PG) and sng-dominant groups (SG). Lactate, 2-methylmaleate, cotinine, PCYOX1, ITIH4, PFN1 and DBH have a higher level in SG. SM(d18:1/25:1), SM(d18:1/26:1), PGD2, LRG1, C8G, C8A, CP and CDH5 in SG are lower than PG. The omics results indicated disordered free radical scavenging, and lipid and amino acid metabolism networks and resulting NF-kappaB-dependent cytokine generation in FM. Lactate level was altered simultaneously in urine and serum and significantly higher in sng-dominant patients than others. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified potential biomarkers from FM patients. The selected biomarkers could discriminate sng and pain phenotypes in FM patients. These results could help elucidate the underlying pathological mechanisms for more effective diagnosis and therapy for FM.
PXD020283	34609160	Extending the Proteomic Characterization of Candida albicans Exposed to Stress and Apoptotic Inducers through Data-Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry. 	Evaluating the stress response in Candida albicans by data independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics	Candida albicans, DIA MS, acetic acid, apoptosis, oxidative stress, proteasome	Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that causes systemic infections in immunosuppressed patients. In order to deal with the changing environment during commensalism or infection, C. albicans must reprogram its proteome. Characterizing the stress-induced changes in the proteome that C. albicans uses to survive should be very useful in the development of new antifungal drugs. We studied the C. albicans global proteome after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and acetic acid (AA), using a data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) strategy. More than 2,000 C. albicans proteins were quantified using an ion library previously constructed using data-dependent acquisition mass spectrometry (DDA-MS). C. albicans responded to treatment with H2O2 with an increase in the abundance of many proteins involved in the oxidative stress response, protein folding, and proteasome-dependent catabolism, which led to increased proteasome activity. The data revealed a previously unknown key role for Prn1, a protein similar to pirins, in the oxidative stress response. Treatment with AA resulted in a general decrease in the abundance of proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis, protein folding, and rRNA processing. Almost all proteasome proteins declined, as did proteasome activity. Apoptosis was observed after treatment with H2O2 but not AA. A targeted proteomic study of 32 proteins related to apoptosis in yeast supported the results obtained by DIA-MS and allowed the creation of an efficient method to quantify relevant proteins after treatment with stressors (H2O2, AA, and amphotericin B). This approach also uncovered a main role for Oye32, an oxidoreductase, suggesting this protein as a possible apoptotic marker common to many stressors. IMPORTANCE Fungal infections are a worldwide health problem, especially in immunocompromised patients and patients with chronic disorders. Invasive candidiasis, caused mainly by C. albicans, is among the most common fungal diseases. Despite the existence of treatments to combat candidiasis, the spectrum of drugs available is limited. For the discovery of new drug targets, it is essential to know the pathogen response to different stress conditions. Our study provides a global vision of proteomic remodeling in C. albicans after exposure to different agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and amphotericin B, that can cause apoptotic cell death. These results revealed the significance of many proteins related to oxidative stress response and proteasome activity, among others. Of note, the discovery of Prn1 as a key protein in the defense against oxidative stress as well the increase in the abundance of Oye32 protein when apoptotic process occurred point them out as possible drug targets.
PXD014503	34609894	Systems approach reveals distinct and shared signaling networks of the four PGE2 receptors in T cells. 	PGE2 signaling networks in T cells	EPIC-XS, ProteomeXchange project tag: PRIME-XS Project, T cells, phosphoflow, phosphoproteomics, signaling	Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment in cancer, partly by signaling through four receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) on T cells. Here, we comprehensively characterized PGE2 signaling networks in helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory T cells using a phosphoproteomics and phosphoflow cytometry approach. We identified ~1500 PGE2-regulated phosphosites and several important EP1-4 signaling nodes, including PKC, CK2, PKA, PI3K, and Src. T cell subtypes exhibited distinct signaling pathways, with the strongest signaling in EP2-stimulated CD8(+) cells. EP2 and EP4, both of which signal through Galphas, induced similar signaling outputs, but with distinct kinetics and intensity. Functional predictions from the observed phosphosite changes revealed PGE2 regulation of key cellular and immunological processes. Last, network modeling suggested signal integration between the receptors and a substantial contribution from G protein-independent signaling. This study offers a comprehensive view of the different PGE2-regulated phosphoproteomes in T cell subsets, providing a valuable resource for further research on this physiologically and pathophysiologically important signaling system.
PXD026791	34610306	Regulation of CYLD activity and specificity by phosphorylation and ubiquitin-binding CAP-Gly domains. 	Regulation of CYLD activity and specificity by phosphorylation and ubiquitin-binding CAP-Gly domains	CYLD phosphorylation and Ub-binding	Non-degradative ubiquitin chains and phosphorylation events govern signaling responses by innate immune receptors. The deubiquitinase CYLD in complex with SPATA2 is recruited to receptor signaling complexes by the ubiquitin ligase LUBAC and regulates Met1- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin and receptor signaling outcomes. Here, we investigate the molecular determinants of CYLD activity. We reveal that two CAP-Gly domains in CYLD are ubiquitin-binding domains and demonstrate a requirement of CAP-Gly3 for CYLD activity and regulation of immune receptor signaling. Moreover, we identify a phosphorylation switch outside of the catalytic USP domain, which activates CYLD toward Lys63-linked polyubiquitin. The phosphorylated residue Ser568 is a novel tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-regulated phosphorylation site in CYLD and works in concert with Ser418 to enable CYLD-mediated deubiquitination and immune receptor signaling. We propose that phosphorylated CYLD, together with SPATA2 and LUBAC, functions as a ubiquitin-editing complex that balances Lys63- and Met1-linked polyubiquitin at receptor signaling complexes to promote LUBAC signaling.

The reproductive toxicant acrylamide modulates the mouse epididymal proteome to drive alterations to the sperm epigenome and dysregulate embryo development	acrylamide, embryo development, epididymis, small non-protein-coding RNA, sperm maturation, spermatozoa	Paternal exposure to environmental stressors elicits distinct changes to the sperm sncRNA profile, modifications that have significant post-fertilization consequences. Despite this knowledge, there remains limited mechanistic understanding of how paternal exposures modify the sperm sncRNA landscape. Here, we report the acute sensitivity of the sperm sncRNA profile to the reproductive toxicant acrylamide. Furthermore, we trace the differential accumulation of acrylamide-responsive sncRNAs to coincide with sperm transit of the proximal (caput) segment of the epididymis, wherein acrylamide exposure alters the abundance of several transcription factors implicated in the expression of acrylamide-sensitive sncRNAs. We also identify extracellular vesicles secreted from the caput epithelium in relaying altered sncRNA profiles to maturing spermatozoa and dysregulated gene expression during early embryonic development following fertilization by acrylamide-exposed spermatozoa. These data provide mechanistic links to account for how environmental insults can alter the sperm epigenome and compromise the transcriptomic profile of early embryos.
PXD017997	34610315	Multiomics of synaptic junctions reveals altered lipid metabolism and signaling following environmental enrichment. 	Multi-omics reveals the lipid inventory of synaptic junctions and altered lipid signaling in environmental enrichment	Endocannabinoid Signaling, Enriched Environment, Lipidomics, Multi-omics, Synaptic Junctions	Membrane lipids and their metabolism have key functions in neurotransmission. Here we provide a quantitative lipid inventory of mouse and rat synaptic junctions. To this end, we developed a multiomics extraction and analysis workflow to probe the interplay of proteins and lipids in synaptic signal transduction from the same sample. Based on this workflow, we generate hypotheses about novel mechanisms underlying complex changes in synaptic connectivity elicited by environmental stimuli. As a proof of principle, this approach reveals that in mice exposed to an enriched environment, reduced endocannabinoid synthesis and signaling is linked to increased surface expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) in a subset of Cannabinoid-receptor 1 positive synapses. This mechanism regulates synaptic strength in an input-specific manner. Thus, we establish a compartment-specific multiomics workflow that is suitable to extract information from complex lipid and protein networks involved in synaptic function and plasticity.
PXD025472	34611154	C. elegans feed yolk to their young in a form of primitive lactation. 	C. elegans provide "milk" for their young	C. elegans, ageing, milk, reproductive death, semelparity, yolk	The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits rapid senescence that is promoted by the insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS) pathway via regulated processes that are poorly understood. IIS also promotes production of yolk for egg provisioning, which in post-reproductive animals continues in an apparently futile fashion, supported by destructive repurposing of intestinal biomass that contributes to senescence. Here we show that post-reproductive mothers vent yolk which can be consumed by larvae and promotes their growth. This implies that later yolk production is not futile; instead vented yolk functions similarly to milk. Moreover, yolk venting is promoted by IIS. These findings suggest that a self-destructive, lactation-like process effects resource transfer from postreproductive C. elegans mothers to offspring, in a fashion reminiscent of semelparous organisms that reproduce in a single, suicidal burst. That this process is promoted by IIS provides insights into how and why IIS shortens lifespan in C. elegans.
PXD024077	34612695	Influenza A H1N1 Induced Disturbance of the Respiratory and Fecal Microbiome of German Landrace Pigs - a Multi-Omics Characterization. 	Influenza A H1N1 induced disturbance of the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiome - a multi-omics characterization	16S rRNA, gastrointestinal, influenza, metabolomics, metaproteomics, microbiome	Seasonal influenza outbreaks represent a large burden for the health care system as well as the economy. While the role of the microbiome has been elucidated in the context of various diseases, the impact of respiratory viral infections on the human microbiome is largely unknown. In this study, swine was used as an animal model to characterize the temporal dynamics of the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiome in response to an influenza A virus (IAV) infection. A multi-omics approach was applied on fecal samples to identify alterations in microbiome composition and function during IAV infection. We observed significantly altered microbial richness and diversity in the gastrointestinal microbiome after IAV infection. In particular, increased abundances of Prevotellaceae were detected, while Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae decreased. Moreover, our metaproteomics data indicated that the functional composition of the microbiome was heavily affected by the influenza infection. For instance, we identified decreased amounts of flagellin, correlating with reduced abundances of Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiaceae, possibly indicating involvement of a direct immune response toward flagellated Clostridia during IAV infection. Furthermore, enzymes involved in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis were identified in higher abundances, while metabolome analyses revealed rather stable concentrations of SCFAs. In addition, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to characterize effects on the composition and natural development of the upper respiratory tract microbiome. Our results showed that IAV infection resulted in significant changes in the abundance of Moraxellaceae and Pasteurellaceae in the upper respiratory tract. Surprisingly, temporal development of the respiratory microbiome structure was not affected. IMPORTANCE Here, we used swine as a biomedical model to elucidate the impact of influenza A H1N1 infection on structure and function of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract microbiome by employing a multi-omics analytical approach. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the temporal development of the porcine microbiome and to provide insights into the functional capacity of the gastrointestinal microbiome during influenza A virus infection.
PXD028096	34613632	The pseudoprotease iRhom1 controls ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins in the nervous system. 	The pseudoprotease iRhom1 controls ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins in the nervous system	CSF, Neuron, hiSPECS	Proteolytic ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins is a fundamental mechanism to control the communication between cells and their environment. A key protease for membrane protein shedding is ADAM17, which requires a non-proteolytic subunit, either inactive Rhomboid 1 (iRhom1) or iRhom2 for its activity. While iRhom1 and iRhom2 are co-expressed in most tissues and appear to have largely redundant functions, the brain is an organ with predominant expression of iRhom1. Yet, little is known about the spatio-temporal expression of iRhom1 in mammalian brain and about its function in controlling membrane protein shedding in the nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that iRhom1 is expressed in mouse brain from the prenatal stage to adulthood with a peak in early postnatal development. In the adult mouse brain iRhom1 was widely expressed, including in cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. Proteomic analysis of the secretome of primary neurons using the hiSPECS method and of cerebrospinal fluid, obtained from iRhom1-deficient and control mice, identified several membrane proteins that require iRhom1 for their shedding in vitro or in vivo. One of these proteins was 'multiple-EGF-like-domains protein 10' (MEGF10), a phagocytic receptor in the brain that is linked to the removal of amyloid beta and apoptotic neurons. MEGF10 was further validated as an ADAM17 substrate using ADAM17-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Taken together, this study discovers a role for iRhom1 in controlling membrane protein shedding in the mouse brain, establishes MEGF10 as an iRhom1-dependent ADAM17 substrate and demonstrates that iRhom1 is widely expressed in murine brain.
PXD013742	34613784	L-bodies are RNA-protein condensates driving RNA localization in Xenopus oocytes. 	L-Bodies are Novel RNA-Protein Condensates Driving RNA Transport in Xenopus Oocytes	RNA localization, RNP, RNP granule, xenopus	Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are membraneless compartments within cells, formed by phase separation, that function as regulatory hubs for diverse biological processes. However, the mechanisms by which RNAs and proteins interact to promote RNP granule structure and function in vivo remain unclear. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, maternal mRNAs are localized as large RNPs to the vegetal hemisphere of the developing oocyte, where local translation is critical for proper embryonic patterning. Here we demonstrate that RNPs containing vegetally localized RNAs represent a new class of cytoplasmic RNP granule, termed localization-bodies (L-bodies). We show that L-bodies contain a dynamic protein-containing phase surrounding a nondynamic RNA-containing phase. Our results support a role for RNA as a critical component within these RNP granules and suggest that cis-elements within localized mRNAs may drive subcellular RNA localization through control over phase behavior.
PXD027961	34615347	tipNrich: A Tip-Based N-Terminal Proteome Enrichment Method. 	tipNrich, a tip-based N-terminal proteome enrichment method	Human plasma, Protein mixture, Recombinant single proteins	The mass spectrometry-based analysis of protein post-translational modifications requires large amounts of sample, complicating the analysis of samples with limited amounts of proteins such as clinical biopsies. Here, we present a tip-based N-terminal analysis method, tipNrich. The entire procedure is processed in a single pipette tip to minimize sample loss, which is so highly optimized to analyze small amounts of proteins, even femtomole-scale of a single protein. With tipNrich, we investigated various single proteins purified from different organisms using a low-resolution mass spectrometer and identified several N-terminal peptides with different Nt-modifications such as ragged N-termini. Furthermore, we applied matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to our method for shortening the analysis time. Moreover, we showed that our method could be utilized in disease diagnosis as exemplified by the characterization of wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis patients compared to the healthy individuals based on N-terminome profiling. In summary, tipNrich will satisfy the need of identifying N-terminal peptides even with highly scarce amounts of proteins and of having faster processing time to check the quality of protein products or to characterize N-terminal proteoform-related diseases.
PXD019519	34615851	Inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system by an NQO1-activatable compound. 	Bioactivatable inhibitor of ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation	UPR, UPS, click-chemistry, pulldown	Malignant cells display an increased sensitivity towards drugs that reduce the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is the primary proteolytic system for destruction of aberrant proteins. Here, we report on the discovery of the bioactivatable compound CBK77, which causes an irreversible collapse of the UPS, accompanied by a general accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins and caspase-dependent cell death. CBK77 caused accumulation of ubiquitin-dependent, but not ubiquitin-independent, reporter substrates of the UPS, suggesting a selective effect on ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. In a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified the redox enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) as a critical mediator of CBK77 activity, and further demonstrated its role as the compound bioactivator. Through affinity-based proteomics, we found that CBK77 covalently interacts with ubiquitin. In vitro experiments showed that CBK77-treated ubiquitin conjugates were less susceptible to disassembly by deubiquitylating enzymes. In vivo efficacy of CBK77 was validated by reduced growth of NQO1-proficient human adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice treated with CBK77. This first-in-class NQO1-activatable UPS inhibitor suggests that it may be possible to exploit the intracellular environment in malignant cells for leveraging the impact of compounds that impair the UPS.
PXD027167	34616044	Metabolic modulation of tumours with engineered bacteria for immunotherapy. 	Metabolic modulation of tumors with engineered bacteria for immunotherapy	Bacteria-based therapies, Cancer Immunotherapy, L-arginine, Metabolic modulation of tumors, Synthetic biology	The availability of L-arginine in tumours is a key determinant of an efficient anti-tumour T cell response(1-4). Consequently, increases of typically low L-arginine concentrations within the tumour may greatly potentiate the anti-tumour responses of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-blocking antibodies(5). However, currently no means are available to locally increase intratumoural L-arginine levels. Here we used a synthetic biology approach to develop an engineered probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 strain that colonizes tumours and continuously converts ammonia, a metabolic waste product that accumulates in tumours(6), to L-arginine. Colonization of tumours with these bacteria increased intratumoural L-arginine concentrations, increased the number of tumour-infiltrating T cells and had marked synergistic effects with PD-L1 blocking antibodies in the clearance of tumours. The anti-tumour effect of these bacteria was mediated by L-arginine and was dependent on T cells. These results show that engineered microbial therapies enable metabolic modulation of the tumour microenvironment leading to enhanced efficacy of immunotherapies.
PXD027539	34616727	ESRRB Facilitates the Conversion of Trophoblast-Like Stem Cells From Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells by Directly Regulating CDX2. 	ESRRB Facilitates the Conversion of Trophoblast-like Stem Cells from Induced Pluripotent Stem cells by Directly Regulating KRT8 and CDX2	CDX2, ESRRB, KRT8, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), trophoblast stem cells (TSCs)	Porcine-induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) could serve as a great model system for human stem cell preclinical research. However, the pluripotency gene network of piPSCs, especially the function for the core transcription factor estrogen-related receptor beta (ESRRB), was poorly understood. Here, we constructed ESRRB-overexpressing piPSCs (ESRRB-piPSCs). Compared with the control piPSCs (CON-piPSCs), the ESRRB-piPSCs showed flat, monolayered colony morphology. Moreover, the ESRRB-piPSCs showed greater chimeric capacity into trophectoderm than CON-piPSCs. We found that ESRRB could directly regulate the expressions of trophoblast stem cell (TSC)-specific markers, including KRT8, KRT18 and CDX2, through binding to their promoter regions. Mutational analysis proved that the N-terminus zinc finger domain is indispensable for ESRRB to regulate the TSC markers. Furthermore, this regulation needs the participation of OCT4. Accordingly, the cooperation between ESRRB and OCT4 facilitates the conversion from pluripotent state to the trophoblast-like state. Our results demonstrated a unique and crucial role of ESRRB in determining piPSCs fate, and shed new light on the molecular mechanism underlying the segregation of embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages.
PXD026695	34616733	Mitochondrial Impairment by MitoBloCK-6 Inhibits Liver Cancer Cell Proliferation. 	Inhibition of the mitochondrial disulfide relay system impairs liver cancer cell proliferation	HCC, disulfide relay, heme, iron, mitochondria	Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) is a critical multi-isoform protein with its longer isoform, located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, being part of the mitochondrial disulfide relay system (DRS). Upregulation of ALR was observed in multiple forms of cancer, among them hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To shed light into ALR function in HCC, we used MitoBloCK-6 to pharmacologically inhibit ALR, resulting in profound mitochondrial impairment and cancer cell proliferation deficits. These effects were mostly reversed by supplementation with bioavailable hemin b, linking ALR function to mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Since many tumor cells are known for their increased iron demand and since increased iron levels in cancer are associated with poor clinical outcome, these results help to further advance the intricate relation between iron and mitochondrial homeostasis in liver cancer.
PXD026851	34619150	Coordinated regulation of the ribosome and proteasome by PRMT1 in the maintenance of neural stemness in cancer cells and neural stem cells. 	Identification of PRMT1 interaction proteins in cancer and neural stem cells	HepG2, NE-4C, PRMT1	Previous studies suggested that cancer cells resemble neural stem/progenitor cells in regulatory network, tumorigenicity, and differentiation potential, and that neural stemness might represent the ground or basal state of differentiation and tumorigenicity. The neural ground state is reflected in the upregulation and enrichment of basic cell machineries and developmental programs, such as cell cycle, ribosomes, proteasomes, and epigenetic factors, in cancers and in embryonic neural or neural stem cells. However, how these machineries are concertedly regulated is unclear. Here, we show that loss of neural stemness in cancer or neural stem cells via muscle-like differentiation or neuronal differentiation, respectively, caused downregulation of ribosome and proteasome components and major epigenetic factors, including PRMT1, EZH2, and LSD1. Furthermore, inhibition of PRMT1, an oncoprotein that is enriched in neural cells during embryogenesis, caused neuronal-like differentiation, downregulation of a similar set of proteins downregulated by differentiation, and alteration of subcellular distribution of ribosome and proteasome components. By contrast, PRMT1 overexpression led to an upregulation of these proteins. PRMT1 interacted with these components and protected them from degradation via recruitment of the deubiquitinase USP7, also known to promote cancer and enriched in embryonic neural cells, thereby maintaining a high level of epigenetic factors that maintain neural stemness, such as EZH2 and LSD1. Taken together, our data indicate that PRMT1 inhibition resulted in repression of cell tumorigenicity. We conclude that PRMT1 coordinates ribosome and proteasome activity to match the needs for high production and homeostasis of proteins that maintain stemness in cancer and neural stem cells.
PXD021186	34620845	ATP-citrate lyase promotes axonal transport across species. 	ATP-Citrate lyase fuels axonal transport across species	Citrate, transport	Microtubule (MT)-based transport is an evolutionary conserved process finely tuned by posttranslational modifications. Among them, alpha-tubulin acetylation, primarily catalyzed by a vesicular pool of alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (Atat1), promotes the recruitment and processivity of molecular motors along MT tracks. However, the mechanism that controls Atat1 activity remains poorly understood. Here, we show that ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) is enriched in vesicles and provide Acetyl-Coenzyme-A (Acetyl-CoA) to Atat1. In addition, we showed that Acly expression is reduced upon loss of Elongator activity, further connecting Elongator to Atat1 in a pathway regulating alpha-tubulin acetylation and MT-dependent transport in projection neurons, across species. Remarkably, comparable defects occur in fibroblasts from Familial Dysautonomia (FD) patients bearing an autosomal recessive mutation in the gene coding for the Elongator subunit ELP1. Our data may thus shine light on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FD.
PXD027517	34621259	Quantitative Proteomic Analysis for High- and Low-Aflatoxin-Yield Aspergillus flavus Strains Isolated From Natural Environments. 	Quantitative proteomic analysis for high- and low-aflatoxin-yield Aspergillus flavus strains isolated from natural environments	Aspergillus flavus, Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), Food and Nutrition (B/D-HPP), Human Proteome Project, PRIME-XS Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Toxicoproteomics (B/D-HPP), natural environments, quantifica	The molecular mechanisms underlying aflatoxin production have been well-studied in strains of the fungus Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus) under artificial conditions. However, aflatoxin biosynthesis has rarely been studied in A. flavus strains isolated from field conditions with different aflatoxin-producing ability. In the present study, tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with tandem-mass spectrometry analysis were used for proteomic quantification in natural isolates of high- and low-aflatoxin-yield A. flavus strains. Additionally, findings obtained using the TMT-labeling method were validated using the high-resolution multiple reaction monitoring (MRM-HR) method. In total, 4,363 proteins were quantified, among which 1,045 proteins were differentially expressed between the high- and low-aflatoxin-yield A. flavus strains. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the up-regulated proteins were significantly enriched in carbon-related metabolism and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, whereas the down-regulated proteins were enriched in oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, GST proteins were found to be significantly down-regulated in high-yield A. flavus strains; this result contradicted previous findings obtained from A. flavus strains grown under artificial conditions. In summary, our study provides novel insights into aflatoxin regulation in A. flavus under field conditions and could facilitate the development of various strategies for the effective control of aflatoxin contamination in food crops.
PXD022551	34621277	Virulence of Vibrio alginolyticus Accentuates Apoptosis and Immune Rigor in the Oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis. 	Virulence of Vibrio alginolyticus as determinants of immune outcomes in the oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis	Vibrio alginolyticus, host-pathogen interactions, oyster, virulence	Vibrio species are ubiquitously distributed in marine environments, with important implications for emerging infectious diseases. However, relatively little is known about defensive strategies deployed by hosts against Vibrio pathogens of distinct virulence traits. Being an ecologically relevant host, the oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis can serve as an excellent model for elucidating mechanisms underlying host-Vibrio interactions. We generated a Vibrio alginolyticus mutant strain (V. alginolyticus(^)(vscC) ) with attenuated virulence by knocking out the vscC encoding gene, a core component of type III secretion system (T3SS), which led to starkly reduced apoptotic rates in hemocyte hosts compared to the V. alginolyticus(WT) control. In comparative proteomics, it was revealed that distinct immune responses arose upon encounter with V. alginolyticus strains of different virulence. Quite strikingly, the peroxisomal and apoptotic pathways are activated by V. alginolyticus(WT) infection, whereas phagocytosis and cell adhesion were enhanced in V. alginolyticus(^)(vscC) infection. Results for functional studies further show that V. alginolyticus(WT) strain stimulated respiratory bursts to produce excess superoxide (O2(*-)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in oysters, which induced apoptosis regulated by p53 target protein (p53tp). Simultaneously, a drop in sGC content balanced off cGMP accumulation in hemocytes and repressed the occurrence of apoptosis to a certain extent during V. alginolyticus(^)(vscC) infection. We have thus provided the first direct evidence for a mechanistic link between virulence of Vibrio spp. and its immunomodulation effects on apoptosis in the oyster. Collectively, we conclude that adaptive responses in host defenses are partially determined by pathogen virulence, in order to safeguard efficiency and timeliness in bacterial clearance.
PXD023979	34622232	Single-cell RNA-seq unravels alterations of the human spermatogonial stem cell compartment in patients with impaired spermatogenesis. 	EGR4-dependent decrease of UTF1 is associated with failure to reserve spermatogonial stem cells in infertile men	Male germline stem cells, human spermatogenesis, impaired spermatogenesis, male infertility, single cell RNA sequencing, spermatogonial stem cells, stem cell differentiation, testis	Despite the high incidence of male infertility, only 30% of infertile men receive a causative diagnosis. To explore the regulatory mechanisms governing human germ cell function in normal and impaired spermatogenesis (crypto), we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (>30,000 cells). We find major alterations in the crypto spermatogonial compartment with increased numbers of the most undifferentiated spermatogonia (PIWIL4(+)). We also observe a transcriptional switch within the spermatogonial compartment driven by increased and prolonged expression of the transcription factor EGR4. Intriguingly, the EGR4-regulated chromatin-associated transcriptional repressor UTF1 is downregulated at transcriptional and protein levels. This is associated with changes in spermatogonial chromatin structure and fewer Adark spermatogonia, characterized by tightly compacted chromatin and serving as reserve stem cells. These findings suggest that crypto patients are disadvantaged, as fewer cells safeguard their germline's genetic integrity. These identified spermatogonial regulators will be highly interesting targets to uncover genetic causes of male infertility.
PXD024760	34622320	A possible role of gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (nES GEMMA) in extracellular vesicle research. 	Human platelet-derived extracellular vesicle proteome	EV, SEC, timsTOF	The emerging role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers and their envisioned therapeutic use require advanced techniques for their detailed characterization. In this context, we investigated gas-phase electrophoresis on a nano electrospray gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analyzer (nES GEMMA, aka nES differential mobility analyzer, nES DMA) as an alternative to standard analytical techniques. In gas-phase electrophoresis, single-charged, surface-dry, native, polydisperse, and aerosolized analytes, e.g., proteins or bio-nanoparticles, are separated according to their electrophoretic mobility diameter, i.e., globular size. Subsequently, monodisperse particles are counted after a nucleation step in a supersaturated atmosphere as they pass a focused laser beam. Hence, particle number concentrations are obtained in accordance with recommendations of the European Commission for nanoparticle characterization (2011/696/EU from October 18th, 2011). Smaller sample constituents (e.g., co-purified proteins) can be detected next to larger ones (e.g., vesicles). Focusing on platelet-derived EVs, we compared different vesicle isolation techniques. In all cases, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) confirmed the presence of vesicles. However, nES GEMMA often revealed a significant co-purification of proteins from the sample matrix, precluding gas-phase electrophoresis of less-diluted samples containing higher vesicle concentrations. Therefore, mainly peaks in the protein size range were detected. Mass spectrometry revealed that these main contaminants belonged to the group of globulins and coagulation-related components. An additional size exclusion chromatography (SEC) step enabled the depletion of co-purified, proteinaceous matrix components, while a label-free quantitative proteomics approach revealed no significant differences in the detected EV core proteome. Hence, the future in-depth analysis of EVs via gas-phase electrophoresis appears feasible. Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs)with/without additional size exclusion chromatographic (SEC) purification were subjected to nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and gas-phase electrophoresis (nES GEMMA). The latter revealed presence of co-purified proteins, targetable via mass spectrometry (MS). MS also revealed that SEC did not influence EV protein content. To conclude, nES GEMMA is a valuable tool for quality control of EV-containing samples under native conditions allowing for detection of co-purified proteins from complex matrices.
PXD028553	34622934	Cryo-EM structure of the dimeric Rhodobacter sphaeroides RC-LH1 core complex at 2.9 Aa: the structural basis for dimerisation. 	Proteomic analysis of the reaction center-light harvesting 1 complex from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, identifying a previously uncharacterized protein component encoded by a newly-identified  ORF.	Rhodobacter sphaeroides, dimerization, photosynthesis, purple bacteria, reaction center light-harvesting-1- complex	The dimeric reaction centre light-harvesting 1 (RC-LH1) core complex of Rhodobacter sphaeroides converts absorbed light energy to a charge separation, and then it reduces a quinone electron and proton acceptor to a quinol. The angle between the two monomers imposes a bent configuration on the dimer complex, which exerts a major influence on the curvature of the membrane vesicles, known as chromatophores, where the light-driven photosynthetic reactions take place. To investigate the dimerisation interface between two RC-LH1 monomers, we determined the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the dimeric complex at 2.9 Aa resolution. The structure shows that each monomer consists of a central RC partly enclosed by a 14-subunit LH1 ring held in an open state by PufX and protein-Y polypeptides, thus enabling quinones to enter and leave the complex. Two monomers are brought together through N-terminal interactions between PufX polypeptides on the cytoplasmic side of the complex, augmented by two novel transmembrane polypeptides, designated protein-Z, that bind to the outer faces of the two central LH1 beta polypeptides. The precise fit at the dimer interface, enabled by PufX and protein-Z, by C-terminal interactions between opposing LH1 alphabeta subunits, and by a series of interactions with a bound sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol lipid, bring together each monomer creating an S-shaped array of 28 bacteriochlorophylls. The seamless join between the two sets of LH1 bacteriochlorophylls provides a path for excitation energy absorbed by one half of the complex to migrate across the dimer interface to the other half.
PXD020278	34623918	Metabolic responsiveness to training depends on insulin sensitivity and protein content of exosomes in insulin-resistant males. 	Small extracellular vesicles from skeletal muscle cells (human)	DIA, EVs, LC-MS, human muscle cells	High-intensity interval training (HIIT) improves cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max), but its impact on metabolism remains unclear. We hypothesized that 12-week HIIT increases insulin sensitivity in males with or without type 2 diabetes [T2D and NDM (nondiabetic humans)]. However, despite identically higher VO2max, mainly insulin-resistant (IR) persons (T2D and IR NDM) showed distinct alterations of circulating small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) along with lower inhibitory metabolic (protein kinase Cepsilon activity) or inflammatory (nuclear factor kappaB) signaling in muscle of T2D or IR NDM, respectively. This is related to the specific alterations in SEV proteome reflecting down-regulation of the phospholipase C pathway (T2D) and up-regulated antioxidant capacity (IR NDM). Thus, SEV cargo may contribute to modulating the individual metabolic responsiveness to exercise training in humans.
PXD018961	34624079	SHMT2 inhibition disrupts the TCF3 transcriptional survival program in Burkitt lymphoma. 	SHMT2 controls Burkitt lymphoma cell survival by maintaining an oncogenic TCF3 transcriptional program	B cell receptor, Burkitt's Lymphoma, One carbon metabolism	Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive lymphoma type that is currently treated by intensive chemoimmunotherapy. Despite the favorable clinical outcome for most patients with BL, chemotherapy-related toxicity and disease relapse remain major clinical challenges, emphasizing the need for innovative therapies. Using genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we identified B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, specific transcriptional regulators, and one-carbon metabolism as vulnerabilities in BL. We focused on serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), a key enzyme in one-carbon metabolism. Inhibition of SHMT2 by either knockdown or pharmacological compounds induced anti-BL effects in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SHMT2 inhibition led to a significant reduction of intracellular glycine and formate levels, which inhibited the mTOR pathway and thereby triggered autophagic degradation of the oncogenic transcription factor TCF3. Consequently, this led to a collapse of tonic BCR signaling, which is controlled by TCF3 and is essential for BL cell survival. In terms of clinical translation, we also identified drugs such as methotrexate that synergized with SHMT inhibitors. Overall, our study has uncovered the dependency landscape in BL, identified and validated SHMT2 as a drug target, and revealed a mechanistic link between SHMT2 and the transcriptional master regulator TCF3, opening up new perspectives for innovative therapies.
PXD021491	34624180	Molecular characterization of triple negative breast cancer formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded samples by data-independent acquisition proteomics. 	Molecular characterization of triple negative breast cancer formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded samples by DIA  proteomics	DIA, DIA+, FFPE, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, breast cancer	Triple negative breast cancer accounts for 15%-20% of all breast carcinomas and is clinically characterized by an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. Triple negative tumors do not benefit from targeted therapies, so further characterization is needed to define subgroups with potential therapeutic value. In this work, the proteomes of 125 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from patients diagnosed with non-metastatic triple negative breast cancer were analyzed using data-independent acquisition + in a LTQ-Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer coupled to an EASY-nLC 1000. 1206 proteins were identified in at least 66% of the samples. Hierarchical clustering, probabilistic graphical models and Significance Analysis of Microarrays were combined to characterize proteomics-based molecular groups. Two molecular groups were defined with differences in biological processes such as glycolysis, translation and immune response. These two molecular groups showed also several differentially expressed proteins. This clinically homogenous dataset may serve to design new therapeutic strategies in the future.
PXD026196	34624297	In vivo Profiling of the Alk Proximitome in the Developing Drosophila Brain. 	BioID-screening reveals the Alk "proximitome" of the Drosophila brain	BirA*, CNS, MiniTurbo, TurboID, signaling	Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk) is an evolutionary conserved receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the insulin receptor superfamily. In addition to its well-studied role in cancer, numerous studies have revealed that Alk signaling is associated with a variety of complex traits such as: regulation of growth and metabolism, hibernation, regulation of neurotransmitters, synaptic coupling, axon targeting, decision making, memory formation and learning, alcohol use disorder, as well as steroid hormone metabolism. In this study, we used BioID-based in vivo proximity labeling to identify molecules that interact with Alk in the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). To do this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 induced homology-directed repair (HDR) to modify the endogenous Alk locus to produce first and next generation Alk::BioID chimeras. This approach allowed identification of Alk proximitomes under physiological conditions and without overexpression. Our results show that the next generation of BioID proteins (TurboID and miniTurbo) outperform the first generation BirA* fusion in terms of labeling speed and efficiency. LC-MS3-based BioID screening of Alk(TurboID) and Alk(miniTurbo) larval brains revealed an extensive neuronal Alk proximitome identifying numerous potential components of Alk signaling complexes. Validation of Alk proximitome candidates further revealed co-expression of Stardust (Sdt), Discs large 1 (Dlg1), Syntaxin (Syx) and Rugose (Rg) with Alk in the CNS and identified the protein-tyrosine-phosphatase Corkscrew (Csw) as a modulator of Alk signaling.
PXD025268	34624498	Long-term adjustment of hepatic lipid metabolism after chronic stress and the role of FGF21. 	Long-term adjustment of hepatic lipid metabolism after chronic stress and the role of FGF21	fatty liver, long-term effects of chronic stress, mouse hepatocytes, secreted proteins	Chronic stress leads to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and metabolic disorders including fatty liver. We hypothesized that stress-induced molecular mechanisms alter energy metabolism, thereby promoting hepatic lipid accumulation even after a stress-free recovery period. In this context, we investigated fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) as protective for energy and glucose homeostasis. FGF21 knockout mice (B6.129S6(SJL)-Fgf21tm1.2Djm; FGF21KO) and control mice (C57BL6; WT) were subjected to chronic variable stress. Mice were examined directly after acute intervention (Cvs) and long-term after 3 months of recovery (3mCvs). In WT, Cvs reduced insulin sensitivity and hepatic lipid accumulation, whilst fatty acid uptake increased. FGF21KO mice responded to Cvs with improved glucose tolerance, insulin resistance but liver triglycerides and plasma lipids were unaltered. Hepatic gene expression was specifically altered by genotype and stress e.g. by PPARa and SREBP-1 regulated genes. The stress-induced alteration of hepatic metabolism persisted after stress recovery. In hepatocytes at 3mCvs, differential gene regulation and secreted proteins indicated a genotype specific progression of liver dysfunction. Overall, at 3mCvs FGF21 was involved in maintaining mitochondrial activity, attenuating de novo lipogenesis, increased fatty acid uptake and histone acetyltransferase activity. Glucocorticoid release and binding to the FGF21 promoter may contribute to prolonged FGF21 release and protection against hepatic lipid accumulation. In conclusion, we showed that stress favors fatty liver disease and FGF21 protected against hepatic lipid accumulation after previous chronic stress loading by i) restored physiological function, ii) modulated gene expression via DNA-modifying enzymes, and iii) maintained energy metabolism.
PXD023835	34625544	The regulatory landscape of the human HPF1- and ARH3-dependent ADP-ribosylome. 	The regulatory landscape of the human HPF1- and ARH3-dependent ADP-ribosylome (part 1)	ADP-ribosylation, ADPr, ARH3, Af1521, HPF1, MAR, PAR, PARG, PARP1, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS	Despite the involvement of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) in many important biological pathways, the target residues of PARP1-mediated ADP-ribosylation remain ambiguous. To explicate the ADP-ribosylation regulome, we analyze human cells depleted for key regulators of PARP1 activity, histone PARylation factor 1 (HPF1) and ADP-ribosylhydrolase 3 (ARH3). Using quantitative proteomics, we characterize 1,596 ADP-ribosylation sites, displaying up to 1000-fold regulation across the investigated knockout cells. We find that HPF1 and ARH3 inversely and homogenously regulate the serine ADP-ribosylome on a proteome-wide scale with consistent adherence to lysine-serine-motifs, suggesting that targeting is independent of HPF1 and ARH3. Notably, we do not detect an HPF1-dependent target residue switch from serine to glutamate/aspartate under the investigated conditions. Our data support the notion that serine ADP-ribosylation mainly exists as mono-ADP-ribosylation in cells, and reveal a remarkable degree of histone co-modification with serine ADP-ribosylation and other post-translational modifications.
PXD028392	34628858	Multiomics Profiling of Alzheimer's Disease Serum for the Identification of Autoantibody Biomarkers. 	Multiomics Profiling of Alzheimer's Disease Serum for the Identification of Autoantibody Biomarkers	Alzheimers disease, PrEST microarrays, autoantibodies, autoantigens, protein microarrays	New biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a diagnostic value in preclinical and prodromal stages are urgently needed. AD-related serum autoantibodies are potential candidate biomarkers. Here, we aimed at identifying AD-related serum autoantibodies using protein microarrays and mass spectrometry-based methods. To this end, an untargeted complementary screening using high-density (42,100 antigens) and low-density (384 antigens) planar protein-epitope signature tag (PrEST) arrays and an immunoprecipitation protocol coupled to mass spectrometry analysis were used for serum autoantibody profiling. From the untargeted screening phase, 377 antigens corresponding to 338 proteins were selected for validation. Out of them, IVD, CYFIP1, and ADD2 seroreactivity was validated using 128 sera from AD patients and controls by PrEST-suspension bead arrays, and ELISA or luminescence Halotag-based bead immunoassay using full-length recombinant proteins. Importantly, IVD, CYFIP1, and ADD2 showed in combination a noticeable AD diagnostic ability. Moreover, IVD protein abundance in the prefrontal cortex was significantly two-fold higher in AD patients than in controls by western blot and immunohistochemistry, whereas CYFIP1 and ADD2 were significantly down-regulated in AD patients. The panel of AD-related autoantigens identified by a comprehensive multiomics approach may provide new insights of the disease and should help in the blood-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Mass spectrometry raw data are available in the ProteomeXchange database with the access number PXD028392.
PXD026015	34630032	Tandem Mass Tag-Based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis Reveals Pathways Involved in Brain Injury Induced by Chest Exposure to Shock Waves. 	TMT-Based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis Reveals the Crucial Biological Pathways Involved in Brain Injury Induced by Chest Exposure to Shock Waves	Chest blast, brain injury, inflammation, signaling pathways, tandem mass spectrometry quantitative proteomics	Recurrent chest blast exposure can lead to brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and mental disorders in soldiers. However, the mechanism that underlies brain injury caused indirectly by chest blasts remains unclear. It is urgent to find additional reliable biomarkers to reveal the intimate details of the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. We used the term tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to screen for differentially expressed proteins in rat brain at different time points after a chest blast. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD025204. Gene Ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), and Cytoscape analyses were used to analyze the proteomic profiles of blast-exposed rats. In addition, we performed Western blotting to verify protein levels. We identified 6,931 proteins, of which 255 were differentially expressed and 43, 84, 52, 97, and 49 were identified in brain tissues at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and 1 week after chest blast exposure, respectively. In this study, the GO, KEGG, Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins, and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) analyses indicated that brain damage caused by chest blast exposure involved many important biological processes and signaling pathways, such as inflammation, cell adhesion, phagocytosis, neuronal and synaptic damage, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Furthermore, Western blotting confirmed that these differentially expressed proteins and affected signaling pathways were associated with brain damage caused by chest blast exposure. This study identifies potential protein biomarkers of brain damage caused indirectly by chest blast and new targets for the treatment of this condition.
PXD028231	34630090	AK2 Promotes the Migration and Invasion of Lung Adenocarcinoma by Activating TGF-beta/Smad Pathway In vitro and In vivo. 	AK2 promotes the migration and invasion of lung adenocarcinoma by activating TGF-beta/Smad pathway in vitro and in vivo	AK2, EMT, TGF-beta, lung adenocarcinoma, tumor metastasis	Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) is a wide-spread and highly conserved protein kinase whose main function is to catalyze the exchange of nucleotide phosphate groups. In this study, we showed that AK2 regulated tumor cell metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma. Positive expression of AK2 is related to lung adenocarcinoma progression and poor survival of patients. Knockdown or knockout of AK2 inhibited, while overexpression of AK2 promoted, human lung adenocarcinoma cell migration and invasion ability. Differential proteomics results showed that AK2 might be closely related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Further research indicated that AK2 regulated EMT occurrence through the Smad-dependent classical signaling pathways as measured by western blot and qPCR assays. Additionally, in vivo experiments showed that AK2-knockout in human lung tumor cells reduced their EMT-like features and formed fewer metastatic nodules both in liver and in lung tissues. In conclusion, we uncover a cancer metastasis-promoting role for AK2 and provide a rationale for targeting AK2 as a potential therapeutic approach for lung cancer.
PXD027536	34631661	A Linkage-specific Sialic Acid Labeling Strategy Reveals Different Site-specific Glycosylation Patterns in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Produced in CHO and HEK Cell Substrates. 	A Linkage- Specific Sialic Acid Labeling Strategy Reveals Different Site-Specific Glycosylation Patterns in SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Produced in CHO and HEK Cell Substrates	Covid-19, Glycopeptide, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, Recombinant SARS-2 Spike, Sialic acids labeling	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus utilizes the extensively glycosylated spike (S) protein protruding from the viral envelope to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-related carboxypeptidase (ACE2) as its primary receptor to mediate host-cell entry. Currently, the main recombinant S protein production hosts are Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. In this study, a recombinant S protein truncated at the transmembrane domain and engineered to express a C-terminal trimerization motif was transiently produced in CHO and HEK cell suspensions. To further evaluate the sialic acid linkages presenting on S protein, a two-step amidation process, employing dimethylamine and ammonium hydroxide reactions in a solid support system, was developed to differentially modify the sialic acid linkages on the glycans and glycopeptides from the S protein. The process also adds a charge to Asp and Glu which aids in ionization. We used MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS with electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD) fragmentation to determine global and site-specific N-linked glycosylation patterns. We identified 21 and 19 out of the 22 predicted N-glycosites of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins produced in CHO and HEK, respectively. It was found that the N-glycosite at 1,158 position (N1158) and at 122, 282 and 1,158 positions (N122, N282 and N1158) were absent on S from CHO and HEK cells, respectively. The structural mapping of glycans of recombinant human S proteins reveals that CHO-Spike exhibits more complex and higher sialylation (alpha2,3-linked) content while HEK-Spike exhibits more high-mannose and a small amount of alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-linked sialic acids. The N74 site represents the most abundant glycosite on both spike proteins. The relatively higher amount of high-mannose abundant sites (N17, N234, N343, N616, N709, N717, N801, and N1134) on HEK-Spike suggests that glycan-shielding may differ among the two constructs. HEK-Spike can also provide different host immune system interaction profiles based on known immune system active lectins. Collectively, these data underscore the importance of characterizing the site-specific glycosylation of recombinant human spike proteins from HEK and CHO cells in order to better understand the impact of the production host on this complex and important protein used in research, diagnostics and vaccines.
PXD027364	34631719	Thrombospondin-4 Is a Soluble Dermal Inflammatory Signal That Selectively Promotes Fibroblast Migration and Keratinocyte Proliferation for Skin Regeneration and Wound Healing. 	Thrombospondin-4 is a soluble dermal signal that selectively promotes fibroblast migration and keratinocyte proliferation for skin regeneration and wound healing	burns, fibroblasts, psoriasis, skin regeneration, thrombospondin-4, wound healing	Thrombospondin-4 (THBS4) is a non-structural extracellular matrix molecule associated with tissue regeneration and a variety of pathological processes characterized by increased cell proliferation and migration. However, the mechanisms of how THBS4 regulates cell behavior as well as the pathways contributing to its effects have remained largely unexplored. In the present study we investigated the role of THBS4 in skin regeneration both in vitro and in vivo. We found that THBS4 expression was upregulated in the dermal compartment of healing skin wounds in humans as well as in mice. Application of recombinant THBS4 protein promoted cutaneous wound healing in mice and selectively stimulated migration of primary fibroblasts as well as proliferation of keratinocytes in vitro. By using a combined proteotranscriptomic pathway analysis approach we discovered that beta-catenin acted as a hub for THBS4-dependent cell signaling and likely plays a key role in promoting its downstream effects. Our results suggest that THBS4 is an important contributor to wound healing and its incorporation into novel wound healing therapies may be a promising strategy for treatment of cutaneous wounds.
PXD028352	34634302	TAF8 regions important for TFIID lobe B assembly or for TAF2 interactions are required for embryonic stem cell survival. 	Importance of  TAF8 regions for TFIID lobe B assembly, or for TAF2 interactions, are required for embryonic stem cell survival	CRISPR/Cas9, TAF complexes, TAF8, TATA binding protein (TBP), TBP-associated factors (TAFs), TFIID, baculovirus over expression, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), function, knock out, structure, viability	The human general transcription factor TFIID is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). In eukaryotic cells, TFIID is thought to nucleate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) preinitiation complex formation on all protein coding gene promoters and thus, be crucial for Pol II transcription. TFIID is composed of three lobes, named A, B, and C. A 5TAF core complex can be assembled in vitro constituting a building block for the further assembly of either lobe A or B in TFIID. Structural studies showed that TAF8 forms a histone fold pair with TAF10 in lobe B and participates in connecting lobe B to lobe C. To better understand the role of TAF8 in TFIID, we have investigated the requirement of the different regions of TAF8 for the in vitro assembly of lobe B and C and the importance of certain TAF8 regions for mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) viability. We have identified a region of TAF8 distinct from the histone fold domain important for assembling with the 5TAF core complex in lobe B. We also delineated four more regions of TAF8 each individually required for interacting with TAF2 in lobe C. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing indicated that the 5TAF core-interacting TAF8 domain and the proline-rich domain of TAF8 that interacts with TAF2 are both required for mouse embryonic stem cell survival. Thus, our study defines distinct TAF8 regions involved in connecting TFIID lobe B to lobe C that appear crucial for TFIID function and consequent ESC survival.
PXD028919	34634305	Basolateral protein Scribble binds phosphatase PP1 to establish a signaling network maintaining apicobasal polarity. 	Basolateral Protein Scribble Provides Phosphatase PP1 to a Signaling Network Maintaining Apicobasal Polarity	Apicobasal Polarity, Phosphatase PP1, Scribble	Scribble, a member of the LAP protein family, contributes to the apicobasal polarity (ABP) of epithelial cells. The LAP-unique region of these proteins, which is essential and sufficient for ABP, includes a conserved Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) domain. The major binding partners of this region that could regulate ABP remain unknown. Here, using proteomics, native gel electrophoresis, and site-directed mutagenesis, we show that the concave surface of LRR domain in Scribble participates in three types of mutually exclusive interactions-(i) homodimerization, serving as an auto-inhibitory mechanism; (ii) interactions with a diverse set of polarity proteins, such as Llgl1, Llgl2, EPB41L2, and EPB41L5, which produce distinct multiprotein complexes; and (iii) a direct interaction with the protein phosphatase, PP1. Analogy with the complex between PP1 and LRR domain of SDS22, a well-studied PP1 regulator, suggests that the Scibble-PP1 complex stores a latent form of PP1 in the basolateral cell cortex. Such organization may generate a dynamic signaling network wherein PP1 could be dispatched from the complex with Scribble to particular protein ligands, achieving fast dephosphorylation kinetics.
PXD028216	34634315	Altered HDL proteome predicts incident CVD in chronic kidney disease patients. 	HDL proteomics on CPROBE samples	HDL proteomics, Orbitrap Fusion, Skyline, parallel reaction monitoring, quantification	Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for CVD. However, traditional lipid risk factors, including low HDL levels, cannot completely explain the increased risk. Altered HDL proteome is linked with both CVD and CKD, but the role of HDL proteins in incident CVD events in patients with CKD is unknown. In this prospective case-control study, we used targeted proteomics to quantify 31 HDL proteins in 92 subjects (46 incident new CVD and 46 one-to-one matched controls) at various stages of CKD. We tested associations of HDL proteins with incident CVD using matched logistic regression analysis. In the model fully adjusted for clinical confounders, lipid levels, C-reactive protein, and proteinuria, no significant associations were found for HDL-C, but we observed inverse associations between levels of HDL proteins paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1), paraoxonase/arylesterase 3 (PON3), and LCAT and incident CVD. Odds ratios (per 1 SD) were 0.38 (0.18-0.97, P = 0.042), 0.42 (0.20-0.92, P = 0.031), and 0.30 (0.11-0.83, P = 0.020) for PON1, PON3, and LCAT, respectively. Apolipoprotein A-IV remained associated with incident CVD in CKD patients in models adjusted for clinical confounders and lipid levels but lost significance with the addition of C-reactive protein and proteinuria to the model. In conclusion, levels of four HDL proteins, PON1, PON3, LCAT, and apolipoprotein A-IV, were found to be inversely associated with incident CVD events in CKD patients. Our observations indicate that HDLs' protein cargo, but not HDL-C levels, can serve as a marker-and perhaps mediator-for elevated CVD risk in CKD patients.
PXD023788	34634997	Quantitative proteomics reveals that dormancy-related proteins mediate the attenuation in mycobacterium strains. 	Quantitative Proteomics Reveals Dormancy Related Proteins Mediated Attenuation Program in Mycobacterium Strain	Mycobacterium tuberculosis, QE-HF, TMT10tags	Although members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) exhibit high similarity, they are characterized by differences with respect to virulence, immune response, and transmissibility. To understand the virulence of these bacteria and identify potential novel therapeutic targets, we systemically investigated the total cell protein contents of virulent H37Rv, attenuated H37Ra, and avirulent M. bovis BCG vaccine strains at the log and stationary phases, based on tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitative proteomics. Data analysis revealed that we obtained deep-coverage protein identification and high quantification. Although 272 genetic variations were reported in H37Ra and H37Rv, they showed very little expression difference in log and stationary phase. Quantitative comparison revealed H37Ra and H37Rv had significantly dysregulation in log phase (227) compared with stationary phase (61). While BCG and H37Rv, and BCG and H37Ra showed notable differences in stationary phase (1171 and 1124) with respect to log phase (381 and 414). In the log phase, similar patterns of protein abundance were observed between H37Ra and BCG, whereas a more similar expression pattern was observed between H37Rv and H37Ra in the stationary phase. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the upregulated proteins detected for H37Rv and H37Ra in log phase were virulence-related factors. In both log and stationary phases, the dysregulated proteins detected for BCG, which have also been identified as M. tuberculosis response proteins under dormancy conditions. We accordingly describe the proteomic profiles of H37Rv, H37Ra, and BCG, which we believe will potentially provide a better understanding of H37Rv pathogenesis, H37Ra attenuation, and BCG immuno protection.
PXD028089	34635772	HMGB1 signaling phosphorylates Ku70 and impairs DNA damage repair in Alzheimer's disease pathology. 	HMGB1 signaling phosphorylates Ku70 and impairs DNA damage repair in Alzheimer's disease pathology	Alzheimers disease, HMGB1, Ku70, phosphorylation	DNA damage is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD), while the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we employ comprehensive phosphoproteome analysis, and identify abnormal phosphorylation of 70 kDa subunit of Ku antigen (Ku70) at Ser77/78, which prevents Ku70-DNA interaction, in human AD postmortem brains. The abnormal phosphorylation inhibits accumulation of Ku70 to the foci of DNA double strand break (DSB), impairs DNA damage repair and eventually causes transcriptional repression-induced atypical cell death (TRIAD). Cells under TRIAD necrosis reveal senescence phenotypes. Extracellular high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, which is released from necrotic or hyper-activated neurons in AD, binds to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) of neighboring neurons, and activates protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha) that executes Ku70 phosphorylation at Ser77/78. Administration of human monoclonal anti-HMGB1 antibody to post-symptomatic AD model mice decreases neuronal DSBs, suppresses secondary TRIAD necrosis of neurons, prevents escalation of neurodegeneration, and ameliorates cognitive symptoms. TRIAD shares multiple features with senescence. These results discover the HMGB1-Ku70 axis that accounts for the increase of neuronal DNA damage and secondary enhancement of TRIAD, the cell death phenotype of senescence, in AD.
PXD027279	34635934	Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry for site-specific glycoproteomics characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 	Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry for site-specific glycoproteomics characterization of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein	Covid-19, DIA, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, SARS-CoV-2, glycoproteomics, glycosylation, spike protein	The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global pandemic of COVID-19, is an abundant, heavily glycosylated surface protein that plays a key role in receptor binding and host cell fusion, and is the focus of all current vaccine development efforts. Variants of concern are now circulating worldwide that exhibit mutations in the spike protein. Protein sequence and glycosylation variations of the spike may affect viral fitness, antigenicity, and immune evasion. Global surveillance of the virus currently involves genome sequencing, but tracking emerging variants should include quantitative measurement of changes in site-specific glycosylation as well. In this work, we used data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry to quantitatively characterize the five N-linked glycosylation sites of the glycoprotein standard alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), as well as the 22 sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that DIA compared favorably to DDA in sensitivity, resulting in more assignments of low-abundance glycopeptides. However, the reproducibility across replicates of DIA-identified glycopeptides was lower than that of DDA, possibly due to the difficulty of reliably assigning low-abundance glycopeptides confidently. The differences in the data acquired between the two methods suggest that DIA outperforms DDA in terms of glycoprotein coverage but that overall performance is a balance of sensitivity, selectivity, and statistical confidence in glycoproteomics. We assert that these analytical and bioinformatics methods for assigning and quantifying glycoforms would benefit the process of tracking viral variants as well as for vaccine development.
PXD026561	34636324	IRAK1-dependent Regnase-1-14-3-3 complex formation controls Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay. 	Phosphorylation-dependent Regnase-1 interactome	Regnase-1, phosphorylation	Regnase-1 is an endoribonuclease crucial for controlling inflammation by degrading mRNAs encoding cytokines and inflammatory mediators in mammals. However, it is unclear how Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay is controlled in interleukin (IL)-1beta- or Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-stimulated cells. Here, by analyzing the Regnase-1 interactome, we found that IL-1beta or TLR stimulus dynamically induced the formation of Regnase-1-beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (betaTRCP) complex. Importantly, we also uncovered a novel interaction between Regnase-1 and 14-3-3 in both mouse and human cells. In IL-1R/TLR-stimulated cells, the Regnase-1-14-3-3 interaction is mediated by IRAK1 through a previously uncharacterized C-terminal structural domain. Phosphorylation of Regnase-1 at S494 and S513 is critical for Regnase-1-14-3-3 interaction, while a different set of phosphorylation sites of Regnase-1 is known to be required for the recognition by betaTRCP and proteasome-mediated degradation. We found that Regnase-1-14-3-3 and Regnase-1-betaTRCP interactions are not sequential events. Rather, 14-3-3 protects Regnase-1 from betaTRCP-mediated degradation. On the other hand, 14-3-3 abolishes Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay by inhibiting Regnase-1-mRNA association. In addition, nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Regnase-1 is abrogated by 14-3-3 interaction. Taken together, the results suggest that a novel inflammation-induced interaction of 14-3-3 with Regnase-1 stabilizes inflammatory mRNAs by sequestering Regnase-1 in the cytoplasm to prevent mRNA recognition.
PXD028303	34637398	Transcriptome and proteome analysis of the antitumor activity of maslinic acid against pancreatic cancer cells. 	proteome analysis of the antitumor activity of maslinic acid against pancreatic cancer cells	maslinic acid, pancreatic cancer cells	Maslinic acid (MA) is a triterpenoid compound of natural abundance in olive plants possessing numerous biological activities. The effect and molecular mechanism of MA on pancreatic cancer cells remain elusive. Here, we explored the anti-tumor activity of MA on human pancreatic cancer cells and the potential underlying molecular mechanism. The anti-cancer effects of MA on whole-cell processes, including proliferation, migration, and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells, were systematically assessed by colony formation, transwell, and migration assays. The search for potential therapeutic targets was achieved via transcriptomics and proteomics analyses. MA was demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PANC-1 and Patu-8988 cells, but induced apoptosis of these cells. Several key candidate genes and proteins of functional relevance for the anti-tumor activity of MA were identified through the association analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics. To our knowledge, this is the first transcription and proteomics-based comprehensive analysis of the mechanism of MA against pancreatic cancer. The findings demonstrate that MA holds promise as a therapeutic drug for managing pancreatic cancer.
PXD026999	34637779	Episymbiotic Saccharibacteria suppresses gingival inflammation and bone loss in mice through host bacterial modulation. 	Ultrasmall epiparasitic Saccharibacteria suppresses gingival inflammation and bone loss through host bacterial modulation	LC-MS, oral microbiome, symbiosis, uncultivable	Saccharibacteria (TM7) are obligate epibionts living on the surface of their host bacteria and are strongly correlated with dysbiotic microbiomes during periodontitis and other inflammatory diseases, suggesting they are putative pathogens. However, due to the recalcitrance of TM7 cultivation, causal research to investigate their role in inflammatory diseases is lacking. Here, we isolated multiple TM7 species on their host bacteria from periodontitis patients. These TM7 species reduce inflammation and consequential bone loss by modulating host bacterial pathogenicity in a mouse ligature-induced periodontitis model. Two host bacterial functions involved in collagen binding and utilization of eukaryotic sialic acid are required for inducing bone loss and are altered by TM7 association. This TM7-mediated downregulation of host bacterial pathogenicity is shown for multiple TM7/host bacteria pairs, suggesting that, in contrast to their suspected pathogenic role, TM7 could protect mammalian hosts from inflammatory damage induced by their host bacteria.
PXD028949	34638018	Machine learning for grading and prognosis of esophageal dysplasia using mass spectrometry and histological imaging. 	Machine learning for grading and prognosis of esophageal dysplasia using mass spectrometry and histological imaging	Barrett's esophagus, Deep learning, H&E staining, Machine learning, Mass spectrometry imaging	BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma and may progress from non-dysplastic through low-grade dysplasia (LGD) to high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and cancer. Grading BE is of crucial prognostic value and is currently based on the subjective evaluation of biopsies. This study aims to investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) using spatially resolved molecular data from mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and histological data from microscopic hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained imaging for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis of BE. METHODS: Biopsies from 57 patients were considered, divided into non-dysplastic (n = 15), LGD non-progressive (n = 14), LGD progressive (n = 14), and HGD (n = 14). MSI experiments were conducted at 50 x 50 mum spatial resolution per pixel corresponding to a tile size of 96x96 pixels in the co-registered H&E images, making a total of 144,823 tiles for the whole dataset. RESULTS: ML models were trained to distinguish epithelial tissue from stroma with area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.89 (MSI) and 0.95 (H&E)) and dysplastic grade (AUC of 0.97 (MSI) and 0.85 (H&E)) on a tile level, and low-grade progressors from non-progressors on a patient level (accuracies of 0.72 (MSI) and 0.48 (H&E)). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, while the H&E-based classifier was best at distinguishing tissue types, the MSI-based model was more accurate at distinguishing dysplastic grades and patients at progression risk, which demonstrates the complementarity of both approaches. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD028949.
PXD026901	34638280	Epigenetic Silencing of miR-33b Promotes Peritoneal Metastases of Ovarian Cancer by Modulating the TAK1/FASN/CPT1A/NF-kappaB Axis. 	Protein expression profile of miR-33b overexpressing ES-2 cells upon OCM treatment	Cell lysate, label free quantification proteomics	Peritoneal metastases are frequently found in high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSOC) patients and are commonly associated with a poor prognosis. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex milieu that plays a critical role in epigenetic alterations driving tumor development and metastatic progression. However, the impact of epigenetic alterations on metastatic ovarian cancer cells in the harsh peritoneal microenvironment remains incompletely understood. Here, we identified that miR-33b is frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation in HGSOC cells derived from metastatic omental tumor tissues. Enforced expression of miR-33b abrogates the oncogenic properties of ovarian cancer cells cocultured in omental conditioned medium (OCM), which mimics the ascites microenvironment, and in vivo tumor growth. Of note, restoration of miR-33b inhibited OCM-upregulated de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation in ovarian cancer cells, indicating that miR-33b may play a novel tumor suppressor role in the lipid-mediated oncogenic properties of metastatic ovarian cancer cells found in the omentum. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that miR-33b directly targets transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), thereby suppressing the activities of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) in modulating lipid metabolic activities and simultaneously inhibiting the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB signaling to govern the oncogenic behaviors of ovarian cancer cells. Thus, our data suggest that a lipid-rich microenvironment may cause epigenetic silencing of miR-33b, which negatively modulates ovarian cancer peritoneal metastases, at least in part, by suppressing TAK1/FASN/CPT1A/NF-kappaB signaling.
PXD027723	34638522	Mass Spectrometric and Bio-Computational Binding Strength Analysis of Multiply Charged RNAse S Gas-Phase Complexes Obtained by Electrospray Ionization from Varying In-Solution Equilibrium Conditions. 	Mass spectrometric and bio-computational analysis of multiply charged RNase S gas phase complexes obtained by electrospray ionization from varying in-solution equilibrium conditions	ITEM-TWO, Off-line ESI-MS, RNase S, complex stability, different pH, varying content of MeOH co-solvent	We investigated the influence of a solvent's composition on the stability of desorbed and multiply charged RNAse S ions by analyzing the non-covalent complex's gas-phase dissociation processes. RNAse S was dissolved in electrospray ionization-compatible buffers with either increasing organic co-solvent content or different pHs. The direct transition of all the ions and the evaporation of the solvent from all the in-solution components of RNAse S under the respective in-solution conditions by electrospray ionization was followed by a collision-induced dissociation of the surviving non-covalent RNAse S complex ions. Both types of changes of solvent conditions yielded in mass spectrometrically observable differences of the in-solution complexation equilibria. Through quantitative analysis of the dissociation products, i.e., from normalized ion abundances of RNAse S, S-protein, and S-peptide, the apparent kinetic and apparent thermodynamic gas-phase complex properties were deduced. From the experimental data, it is concluded that the stability of RNAse S in the gas phase is independent of its in-solution equilibrium but is sensitive to the complexes' gas-phase charge states. Bio-computational in-silico studies showed that after desolvation and ionization by electrospray, the remaining binding forces kept the S-peptide and S-protein together in the gas phase predominantly by polar interactions, which indirectly stabilized the in-bulk solution predominating non-polar intermolecular interactions. As polar interactions are sensitive to in-solution protonation, bio-computational results provide an explanation of quantitative experimental data with single amino acid residue resolution.
PXD018948	34638634	Proteomic Study of Low-Birth-Weight Nephropathy in Rats. 	Proteomic study of low-birth-weight nephropathy molecular pathogenesis in rats	Low birth weight, Meprin, kidney, mitochondria, nephropathy	The hyperfiltration theory has been used to explain the mechanism of low birth weight (LBW)-related nephropathy. However, the molecular changes in the kidney proteome have not been defined in this disease, and early biomarkers are lacking. We investigated the molecular pathogenesis of LBW rats obtained by intraperitoneal injection of dexamethasone into pregnant animals. Normal-birth-weight (NBW) rats were used as controls. When the rats were four weeks old, the left kidneys were removed and used for comprehensive label-free proteomic studies. Following uninephrectomy, all rats were fed a high-salt diet until 9 weeks of age. Differences in the molecular composition of the kidney cortex were observed at the early step of LBW nephropathy pathogenesis. Untargeted quantitative proteomics showed that proteins involved in energy metabolism, such as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the TCA cycle, and glycolysis, were specifically downregulated in the kidneys of LBW rats at four weeks. No pathological changes were detected at this early stage. Pathway analysis identified NEFL2 (NRF2) and RICTOR as potential upstream regulators. The search for biomarkers identified components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, namely, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex subunits (UQCR7/11) and ATP5I/L, two components of mitochondrial F1FO-ATP synthase. These findings were further validated by immunohistology. At later stages of the disease process, the right kidneys revealed an increased frequency of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Our findings revealed proteome changes in LBW rat kidneys and revealed a strong downregulation of specific mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins, such as UQCR7.
PXD027962	34638657	Arabidopsis LSH8 Positively Regulates ABA Signaling by Changing the Expression Pattern of ABA-Responsive Proteins. 	Functional analysis of Arabidopsis LSH8 protein involved in ABA signaling pathway	Arabidopsis LSH8 protein ABA signaling pathway	Phytohormone ABA regulates the expression of numerous genes to significantly affect seed dormancy, seed germination and early seedling responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the function of many ABA-responsive genes remains largely unknown. In order to improve the ABA-related signaling network, we conducted a large-scale ABA phenotype screening. LSH, an important transcription factor family, extensively participates in seedling development and floral organogenesis in plants, but whether its family genes are involved in the ABA signaling pathway has not been reported. Here we describe a new function of the transcription factor LSH8 in an ABA signaling pathway. In this study, we found that LSH8 was localized in the nucleus, and the expression level of LSH8 was significantly induced by exogenous ABA at the transcription level and protein level. Meanwhile, seed germination and root length measurements revealed that lsh8 mutant lines were ABA insensitive, whereas LSH8 overexpression lines showed an ABA-hypersensitive phenotype. With further TMT labeling quantitative proteomic analysis, we found that under ABA treatment, ABA-responsive proteins (ARPs) in the lsh8 mutant presented different changing patterns with those in wild-type Col4. Additionally, the number of ARPs contained in the lsh8 mutant was 397, six times the number in wild-type Col4. In addition, qPCR analysis found that under ABA treatment, LSH8 positively mediated the expression of downstream ABA-related genes of ABI3, ABI5, RD29B and RAB18. These results indicate that in Arabidopsis, LSH8 is a novel ABA regulator that could specifically change the expression pattern of APRs to positively mediate ABA responses.
PXD023866	34638725	C9ORF72 Repeat Expansion Affects the Proteome of Primary Skin Fibroblasts in ALS. 	C9ORF72 repeat expansion  affects the proteome of primary skin fibroblasts in ALS and FTD	ALS, Fibroblast, HDMSe	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of the corticospinal motor neurons, which ultimately leads to death. The repeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) represents the most common genetic cause of ALS and it is also involved in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative disorders. To offer insights into C9ORF72-mediated pathogenesis, we quantitatively analyzed the proteome of patient-derived primary skin fibroblasts from ALS patients carrying the C9ORF72 mutation compared with ALS patients who tested negative for it. Differentially expressed proteins were identified, used to generate a protein-protein interaction network and subjected to a functional enrichment analysis to unveil altered molecular pathways. ALS patients were also compared with patients affected by frontotemporal dementia carrying the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. As a result, we demonstrated that the molecular pathways mainly altered in fibroblasts (e.g., protein homeostasis) mirror the alterations observed in C9ORF72-mutated neurons. Moreover, we highlighted novel molecular pathways (nuclear and mitochondrial transports, vesicle trafficking, mitochondrial bioenergetics, glucose metabolism, ER-phagosome crosstalk and Slit/Robo signaling pathway) which might be further investigated as C9ORF72-specific pathogenetic mechanisms. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD023866.
PXD024519	34638844	Acid Stripping after Infection Improves the Detection of Viral HLA Class I Natural Ligands Identified by Mass Spectrometry. 	XL-MS analysis of human tyrosine hydroxylase	BS3, Dopamine, Tyrosine hydroxylase, XL-MS	Identification of a natural human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligandome is a key element to understand the cellular immune response. Advanced high throughput mass spectrometry analyses identify a relevant, but not complete, fraction of the many tens of thousands of self-peptides generated by antigen processing in live cells. In infected cells, in addition to this complex HLA ligandome, a minority of peptides from degradation of the few proteins encoded by the viral genome are also bound to HLA class I molecules. In this study, the standard immunopeptidomics strategy was modified to include the classical acid stripping treatment after virus infection to enrich the HLA ligandome in virus ligands. Complexes of HLA-B*27:05-bound peptide pools were isolated from vaccinia virus (VACV)-infected cells treated with acid stripping after virus infection. The HLA class I ligandome was identified using high throughput mass spectrometry analyses, yielding 37 and 51 natural peptides processed and presented untreated and after acid stripping treatment VACV-infected human cells, respectively. Most of these virus ligands were identified in both conditions, but exclusive VACV ligands detected by mass spectrometry detected on acid stripping treatment doubled the number of those identified in the untreated VACV-infected condition. Theoretical binding affinity prediction of the VACV HLA-B*27:05 ligands and acute antiviral T cell response characterization in the HLA transgenic mice model showed no differences between HLA ligands identified under the two conditions: untreated and under acid stripping condition. These findings indicated that acid stripping treatment could be useful to identify HLA class I ligands from virus-infected cells.
PXD027052	34638888	Comparative Phosphoproteomic Analysis Reveals the Response of Starch Metabolism to High-Temperature Stress in Rice Endosperm. 	Phosphoproteome of rice endosperm	Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.), endosperm, phosphoproteome, phosphorylation, starch biosynthesis, starch quality, sucrose and starch metabolism	High-temperature stress severely affects rice grain quality. While extensive research has been conducted at the physiological, transcriptional, and protein levels, it is still unknown how protein phosphorylation regulates seed development in high-temperature environments. Here, we explore the impact of high-temperature stress on the phosphoproteome of developing grains from two indica rice varieties, 9311 and Guangluai4 (GLA4), with different starch qualities. A total of 9994 phosphosites from 3216 phosphoproteins were identified in all endosperm samples. We identified several consensus phosphorylation motifs ([sP], [LxRxxs], [Rxxs], [tP]) induced by high-temperature treatment and revealed a core set of protein kinases, splicing factors, and regulatory factors in response to high-temperature stress, especially those involved in starch metabolism. A detailed phosphorylation scenario in the regulation of starch biosynthesis (AGPase, GBSSI, SSIIa, SSIIIa, BEI, BEIIb, ISA1, PUL, PHO1, PTST) in rice endosperm was proposed. Furthermore, the dynamic changes in phosphorylated enzymes related to starch synthesis (SSIIIa-Ser94, BEI-Ser562, BEI-Ser620, BEI-Ser821, BEIIb-Ser685, BEIIb-Ser715) were confirmed by Western blot analysis, which revealed that phosphorylation might play specific roles in amylopectin biosynthesis in response to high-temperature stress. The link between phosphorylation-mediated regulation and starch metabolism will provide new insights into the mechanism underlying grain quality development in response to high-temperature stress.
PXD027700	34639174	Tissue Sampling and Homogenization in the Sub-Microliter Scale with a Nanosecond Infrared Laser (NIRL) for Mass Spectrometric Proteomics. 	Sampling and homogenization of nanoliter tissue with a nanosecond infrared laser (NIRL) for mass spectrometric proteomics	Tissue sampling, laser ablation, nanosecond infrared laser	It was recently shown that ultrashort pulse infrared (IR) lasers, operating at the wavelength of the OH vibration stretching band of water, are highly efficient for sampling and homogenizing biological tissue. In this study we utilized a tunable nanosecond infrared laser (NIRL) for tissue sampling and homogenization with subsequent liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis for mass spectrometric proteomics. For the first time, laser sampling was performed with murine spleen and colon tissue. An ablation volume of 1.1 x 1.1 x 0.4 mm(3) (approximately 0.5 microL) was determined with optical coherence tomography (OCT). The results of bottom-up proteomics revealed proteins with significant abundance differences for both tissue types, which are in accordance with the corresponding data of the Human Protein Atlas. The results demonstrate that tissue sampling and homogenization of small tissue volumes less than 1 microL for subsequent mass spectrometric proteomics is feasible with a NIRL.
PXD025899	34639210	Characterization of the Human Eccrine Sweat Proteome-A Focus on the Biological Variability of Individual Sweat Protein Profiles. 	Human eccrine sweat shotgun proteomics for personalized monitoring and therapy	Eccrine sweat, Shotgun proteomics	The potential of eccrine sweat as a bio-fluid of interest for diagnosis and personalized therapy has not yet been fully evaluated, due to the lack of in-depth sweat characterization studies. Thanks to recent developments in omics, together with the availability of accredited sweat collection methods, the analysis of human sweat may now be envisioned as a standardized, non-invasive test for individualized monitoring and personalized medicine. Here, we characterized individual sweat samples, collected from 28 healthy adult volunteers under the most standardized sampling methodology, by applying optimized shotgun proteomics. The thorough characterization of the sweat proteome allowed the identification of 983 unique proteins from which 344 were identified across all samples. Annotation-wise, the study of the sweat proteome unveiled the over-representation of newly addressed actin dynamics, oxidative stress and proteasome-related functions, in addition to well-described proteolysis and anti-microbial immunity. The sweat proteome composition correlated with the inter-individual variability of sweat secretion parameters. In addition, both gender-exclusive proteins and gender-specific protein abundances were highlighted, despite the high similarity between human female and male sweat proteomes. In conclusion, standardized sample collection coupled with optimized shotgun proteomics significantly improved the depth of sweat proteome coverage, far beyond previous similar studies. The identified proteins were involved in many diverse biological processes and molecular functions, indicating the potential of this bio-fluid as a valuable biological matrix for further studies. Addressing sweat variability, our results prove the proteomic profiling of sweat to be a promising bio-fluid analysis for individualized, non-invasive monitoring and personalized medicine.
PXD025022	34639632	Proteomic Characterization of the Cellular Effects of AhR Activation by Microbial Tryptophan Catabolites in Endotoxin-Activated Human Macrophages. 	Proteomic characterization of the cellular effects of AHR activation by microbial tryptophan catabolites in endotoxin-activated human macrophages	AhR, Benzo[a]pyrene, Indole-3-acetic acide, Indole-3-aldehyde, Lipopolysaccharides, TMT, Tryptophan catabolites, human macrophages, metabolism	Sensing microbial tryptophan catabolites by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays a pivotal role in host-microbiome homeostasis by modulating the host immune response. Nevertheless, the involved cellular processes triggered by the metabolites are mainly unknown. Here, we analyzed proteomic changes in macrophages after treatment with the tryptophan metabolites indole-3-acetic acid (I3AA) or indole-3-aldehyde (IAld), as well as the prototypic exogenous AhR-ligand benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) in the absence and presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to identify affected cellular processes and pathways. The AhR-ligands regulated metabolic and immunologic processes in dependency of LPS co-stimulation. All investigated ligands time-dependently enhanced fatty acid beta-oxidation. Differences due to the combination with LPS were observed for all three ligands. Additionally, oxidative phosphorylation was significantly increased by IAld and I3AA in a time and LPS-dependent manner. Immunoregulatory processes were affected in distinct ways. While BaP and I3AA up-regulated IL-8 signaling, IL-6 signaling was decreased by IAld. BaP decreased the inflammasome pathway. Thus, AhR-ligand-dependent regulations were identified, which may modulate the response of macrophages to bacterial infections, but also the commensal microbiota through changes in immune cell signaling and metabolic pathways that may also alter functionality. These findings highlight the relevance of AhR for maintaining microbial homeostasis and, consequently, host health.
PXD025555	34641704	Myofilament Phosphorylation in Stem Cell Treated Diastolic Heart Failure. 	Hyperphosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: selective reversal of PKC hyperactivity by cell therapy	Cardiosphere-Derived Cell (CDC), Diastolic dysfunction, Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), Myofilament phosphorylation, Protein kinase C (PKC)	RATIONALE: Phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins has been implicated in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF); such changes may contribute to diastolic dysfunction by altering contractility, cardiac stiffness, Ca(2+)-sensitivity, and mechanosensing. Treatment with cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) restores normal diastolic function, attenuates fibrosis and inflammation, and improves survival in a rat HFpEF model. OBJECTIVE: Phosphorylation changes that underlie HFpEF and those reversed by CDC therapy, with a focus on the sarcomeric subproteome were analyzed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Dahl salt-sensitive rats fed a high-salt diet, with echocardiographically verified diastolic dysfunction, were randomly assigned to either intracoronary CDCs or placebo. Dahl salt-sensitive rats receiving low salt diet served as controls. Protein and phosphorylated Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues from left ventricular tissue were quantified by mass spectrometry. HFpEF hearts exhibited extensive hyperphosphorylation with 98% of the 529 significantly changed phospho-sites increased compared with control. Of those, 39% were located within the sarcomeric subproteome, with a large group of proteins located or associated with the Z-disk. CDC treatment partially reverted the hyperphosphorylation, with 85% of the significantly altered 76 residues hypophosphorylated. Bioinformatic upstream analysis of the differentially phosphorylated protein residues revealed PKC as the dominant putative regulatory kinase. PKC isoform analysis indicated increases in PKC alpha, beta, and delta concentration, whereas CDC treatment led to a reversion of PKCbeta. Use of PKC isoform specific inhibition and overexpression of various PKC isoforms strongly suggests that PKCbeta is the dominant kinase involved in hyperphosphorylation in HFpEF and is altered with CDC treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Increased protein phosphorylation at the Z-disk is associated with diastolic dysfunction, with PKC isoforms driving most quantified phosphorylation changes. Because CDCs reverse the key abnormalities in HFpEF and selectively reverse PKCbeta upregulation, PKCbeta merits being classified as a potential therapeutic target in HFpEF, a disease notoriously refractory to medical intervention.
PXD024529	34642952	Regulation of electrogenic Na(+) /HCO3(-) cotransporter 1 (NBCe1) function and its dependence on m-TOR mediated phosphorylation of Ser(245). 	Regulation of electrogenic Na+/HCO3- cotransporter 1 (NBCe1) in mouse cortical astrocytes and its dependence on m-TOR mediated phosphorylation of Ser245.	acid-base, acidosis, glial cells, pH, signaling	Astrocytes are pivotal responders to alterations of extracellular pH, primarily by regulation of their principal acid-base transporter, the membrane-bound electrogenic Na(+) /bicarbonate cotransporter 1 (NBCe1). Here, we describe amammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent and NBCe1-mediated astroglial response to extracellular acidosis. Using primary mouse cortical astrocytes, we investigated the effect of long-term extracellular metabolic acidosis on regulation of NBCe1 and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms by immunoblotting, biotinylation of surface proteins, intracellular H(+) recording using the H(+) -sensitive dye 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, and phosphoproteomic analysis. The results showed significant increase of NBCe1-mediated recovery of intracellular pH from acidification in WT astrocytes, but not in cortical astrocytes from NBCe1-deficient mice. Acidosis-induced upregulation of NBCe1 activity was prevented following inhibition of mTOR signaling by rapamycin. Yet, during acidosis or following exposure of astrocytes to rapamycin, surface protein abundance of NBCe1 remained -unchanged. Mutational analysis in HeLa cells suggested that NBCe1 activity was dependent on phosphorylation state of Ser(245) , a residue conserved in all NBCe1 variants. Moreover, phosphorylation state of Ser(245) is regulated by mTOR and is inversely correlated with NBCe1 transport activity. Our results identify pSer(245) as a novel regulator of NBCe1 functional expression. We propose that context-dependent and mTOR-mediated multisite phosphorylation of serine residues of NBCe1 is likely to be a potent mechanism contributing to the response of astrocytes to acid/base challenges during pathophysiological conditions.
PXD019249	34643063	The m(6) A Readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 Synergistically Control Cerebellar Parallel Fiber Growth by Regulating Local Translation of the Key Wnt5a Signaling Components in Axons. 	Quantitative proteomic analysis of mouse cerebellar granule cells after knockdown of YTHDF1	Local translation, YTHDF1, YTHDF2	Messenger RNA m(6) A modification is shown to regulate local translation in axons. However, how the m(6) A codes in axonal mRNAs are read and decoded by the m(6) A reader proteins is still unknown. Here, it is found that the m(6) A readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 are both expressed in cerebellar granule cells (GCs) and their axons. Knockdown (KD) of YTHDF1 or YTHDF2 significantly increases GC axon growth rates in vitro. By integrating anti-YTHDF1&2 RIP-Seq with the quantitative proteomic analysis or RNA-seq after KD of YTHDF1 or YTHDF2, a group of transcripts which may mediate the regulation of GC axon growth by YTHDFs is identified. Among them, Dvl1 and Wnt5a, encoding the key components of Wnt pathway, are further found to be locally translated in axons, which are controlled by YTHDF1 and YTHDF2, respectively. Specific ablation of Ythdf1 or Ythdf2 in GCs increases parallel fiber growth, promotes synapse formation in cerebellum in vivo, and improves motor coordination ability. Together, this study identifies a mechanism by which the m(6) A readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 work synergistically on the Wnt5a pathway through regulating local translation in GC axons to control cerebellar parallel fiber development.
PXD025915	34643455	A systems-level analysis of bile acids effects on rat colon epithelial cells. 	Proteomics analysis of bile acids modulation on rat colonic expression of water, electrolyte and drug transporters	bile acid, colon, rat, transporter	Bile acid diarrhea is a chronic condition caused by increased delivery of bile acids to the colon. The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. To investigate genes involved in bile acid diarrhea, systems-level analyses were used on a rat bile acid diarrhea model. Twelve male Wistar Munich rats, housed in metabolic cages, were fed either control or bile acid-mixed (1% wt/wt) diets for 10 days. Food intake, water intake, urine volume, body weight, and fecal output were monitored daily. After euthanasia, colonic epithelial cells were isolated using calcium chelation and processed for systems-level analyses, that is, RNA-sequencing transcriptomics and mass spectrometry proteomics. Bile acid-fed rats suffered diarrhea, indicated by increased drinking, feces weight, and fecal water content compared with control rats. Urine output was unchanged. With bile acid feeding, RNA-sequencing revealed 204 increased and 401 decreased mRNAs; mass spectrometry revealed 183 increased and 111 decreased proteins. Among the altered genes were genes associated with electrolyte and water transport (including Slc12a7, Clca4, and Aqp3) and genes associated with bile acid transport (Slc2b1, Abcg2, Slc51a, Slc51b, and Fabps). Correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation (Pearson's r = 0.28) between changes in mRNA expression and changes in protein expression. However, caution must be exercised in making a direct correlation between experimentally determined transcriptomes and proteomes. Genes associated with bile acid transport responded to bile acid feeding, suggesting that colonic bile acid transport also occur by regulated protein facilitated mechanisms in addition to passive diffusion. In summary, the study provides annotated rat colonic epithelial cell transcriptome and proteome with response to bile acid feeding.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Feeding rats with a bile acid caused changes in fecal output, underlining this bile acid diarrhea model's usefulness. Colonic epithelial expression of genes associated with facilitated transport of bile acids was altered during bile acid feeding. The study raises the possibility of regulated colonic transepithelial transport of bile acids in response to luminal bile acids. In addition, this study provides annotated rat colonic epithelial cell transcriptome and proteome with response to bile acid feeding.
PXD022399	34644148	Ubiquitination and degradation of SUMO1 by small-molecule degraders extends survival of mice with patient-derived tumors. 	Small-molecule degraders of SUMO1 induce the protein ubiquitination and degradation through CAPRIN1-CUL1-FBXO42 ubiquitin ligase for cancer therapySmall-molecule degraders of SUMO1 induce the protein ubiquitination and degradation through CAPRIN1-CUL1-FBX	CAPRIN1, CRISPR-CAS9, CUL1 E3 ligase, E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBXO42, HCT116, SUMO1, cancer, sumoylation, ubiquitination	Discovery of small-molecule degraders that activate ubiquitin ligase-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of targeted oncoproteins in cancer cells has been an elusive therapeutic strategy. Here, we report a cancer cell-based drug screen of the NCI drug-like compounds library that enabled identification of small-molecule degraders of the small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO1). Structure-activity relationship studies of analogs of the hit compound CPD1 led to identification of a lead compound HB007 with improved properties and anticancer potency in vitro and in vivo. A genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen identified the substrate receptor F-box protein 42 (FBXO42) of cullin 1 (CUL1) E3 ubiquitin ligase as required for HB007 activity. Using HB007 pull-down proteomics assays, we pinpointed HB007's binding protein as the cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein 1 (CAPRIN1). Biolayer interferometry and compound competitive immunoblot assays confirmed the selectivity of HB007's binding to CAPRIN1. When bound to CAPRIN1, HB007 induced the interaction of CAPRIN1 with FBXO42. FBXO42 then recruited SUMO1 to the CAPRIN1-CUL1-FBXO42 ubiquitin ligase complex, where SUMO1 was ubiquitinated in several of human cancer cells. HB007 selectively degraded SUMO1 in patient tumor-derived xenografts implanted into mice. Systemic administration of HB007 inhibited the progression of patient-derived brain, breast, colon, and lung cancers in mice and increased survival of the animals. This cancer cell-based screening approach enabled discovery of a small-molecule degrader of SUMO1 and may be useful for identifying other small-molecule degraders of oncoproteins.
PXD022556	34644561	Proteomics reveal cap-dependent translation inhibitors remodel the translation machinery and translatome. 	Translatome and Translation Machinery Remodeling by eIF4A Inhibitors  Mediates Antitumor Potency.	Cancer, MATRIX, Rocaglate, Translate, Translatome, eifFA, pulse SILAC	Tactical disruption of protein synthesis is an attractive therapeutic strategy, with the first-in-class eIF4A-targeting compound zotatifin in clinical evaluation for cancer and COVID-19. The full cellular impact and mechanisms of these potent molecules are undefined at a proteomic level. Here, we report mass spectrometry analysis of translational reprogramming by rocaglates, cap-dependent initiation disruptors that include zotatifin. We find effects to be far more complex than simple "translational inhibition" as currently defined. Translatome analysis by TMT-pSILAC (tandem mass tag-pulse stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture mass spectrometry) reveals myriad upregulated proteins that drive hitherto unrecognized cytotoxic mechanisms, including GEF-H1-mediated anti-survival RHOA/JNK activation. Surprisingly, these responses are not replicated by eIF4A silencing, indicating a broader translational adaptation than currently understood. Translation machinery analysis by MATRIX (mass spectrometry analysis of active translation factors using ribosome density fractionation and isotopic labeling experiments) identifies rocaglate-specific dependence on specific translation factors including eEF1epsilon1 that drive translatome remodeling. Our proteome-level interrogation reveals that the complete cellular response to these historical "translation inhibitors" is mediated by comprehensive translational landscape remodeling.
PXD024175	34644566	Proteotranscriptomic classification and characterization of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. 	Proteotranscriptomic classification and characterization of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms	Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms	Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are biologically and clinically heterogeneous. Here, we use a multi-omics approach to uncover the molecular factors underlying this heterogeneity. Transcriptomic analysis of 84 PNEN specimens, drawn from two cohorts, is substantiated with proteomic profiling and identifies four subgroups: Proliferative, PDX1-high, Alpha cell-like and Stromal/Mesenchymal. The Proliferative subgroup, consisting of both well- and poorly differentiated specimens, is associated with inferior overall survival probability. The PDX1-high and Alpha cell-like subgroups partially resemble previously described subtypes, and we further uncover distinctive metabolism-related features in the Alpha cell-like subgroup. The Stromal/Mesenchymal subgroup exhibits molecular characteristics of YAP1/WWTR1(TAZ) activation suggestive of Hippo signaling pathway involvement in PNENs. Whole-exome sequencing reveals subgroup-enriched mutational differences, supported by activity inference analysis, and identifies hypermorphic proto-oncogene variants in 14.3% of sequenced PNENs. Our study reveals differences in cellular signaling axes that provide potential directions for PNEN patient stratification and treatment strategies.
PXD027900	34645797	TSSK4 upregulation in alveolar epithelial type-II cells facilitates pulmonary fibrosis through HSP90-AKT signaling restriction and AT-II apoptosis. 	Relative quantitative analysis of mouse lung tissue from bleomycin induced pulmonary lung fibrosis mice model through iTRAQ (isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification) quantitative proteomics	IPF, bleomycin, lung	Alveolar epithelial injury is one of the important pathological changes in idiopathic pulmonary interstitial fibrosis (IPF), but the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Here, we reported that alveolar epithelial type-II cells (AT II) play important roles in pathological process of pulmonary fibrosis. Through iTRAQ (isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification) quantitative proteomics, TSSK4 was identified to be upregulated in bleomycin-induced fibrotic mice model, which was further confirmed in clinical IPF patients' tissue specimens. TSSK4 is a germ-related protein, but its expression in other tissues and the association with other diseases are not reported. Immunofluorescence staining showed that TSSK4 selectively expressed in AT-II cells, which are essential for inflammation-induced AT-II loss during fibrosis. Luciferase assay and other molecular biological experiments proved that TSSK4 expression is regulated by TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB signaling. The TSSK4 kinase activity is found to be closely related to the function of HSP90-AKT pathway that TSSK4 can phosphorylate its substrate HSP90beta on serine 255, to inhibit the ATPase activity of HSP90beta and reduce its molecular chaperone function on AKT. Under this condition, kinase activity of AKT is diminished to interfere its survival function, subsequently facilitating AT-II cellular apoptosis through the mitochondrial death machinery. Our findings highlight the importance of TSSK4 in regulating pulmonary fibrosis by facilitating AT-II loss through HSP90-AKT signaling, all of which suggest TSSK4 and the regulating mechanism as attractive targets for the clinical intervention of pulmonary injury and fibrosis.
PXD027981	34645915	The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor Roscovitine prevents diet-induced metabolic disruption in obese mice. 	The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor Roscovitine reverses diet-induced metabolic disruption in obese mice	adipose mitochondria, obesity, roscovitine, therapy	Most strategies to treat obesity-related disorders have involved prevention of diet-induced weight gain in lean mice. Treatment of obese individuals will require therapies that reverse the detrimental effects of excess body weight. Cyclin-dependent kinases have been shown to contribute to obesity and its adverse complications. Here, we show that roscovitine; a an orally available cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor; given to male mice during the last six weeks of a 19-week high fat diet, reduced weight gain and prevented accompanying insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, visceral adipose tissue (eWAT) inflammation/fibrosis as well as restored insulin secretion and enhanced whole body energy expenditure. Proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis of eWAT demonstrated that roscovitine suppressed expression of peptides and phosphopeptides linked to inflammation and extracellular matrix proteins. It also identified 17 putative protein kinases perturbed by roscovitine, including CMGC kinases, AGC kinases and CAMK kinases. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that lipid metabolism, TCA cycle, fatty acid beta oxidation and creatine biosynthesis are enriched following roscovitine treatment. For brown adipose tissue (BAT), analysis of upstream kinases controlling the phosphoproteome revealed two major kinase groups, AGC and CMGC kinases. Among the top enriched pathways were insulin signaling, regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, thyroid hormone signaling, thermogenesis and cAMP-PKG signaling. We conclude that roscovitine is effective at preventing prolonged diet-induced metabolic disruption and restoring mitochondrial activity in BAT and eWAT.
PXD027155	34645991	Arabidopsis thaliana myosin XIK is recruited to the Golgi through interaction with a MyoB receptor. 	Search for the interactors of Arabidopsis thaliana myosin receptor MRF7	LCMS, myosin	Plant cell organelles are highly mobile and their positioning play key roles in plant growth, development and responses to changing environmental conditions. Movement is acto-myosin dependent. Despite controlling the dynamics of several organelles, myosin and myosin receptors identified so far in Arabidopsis thaliana generally do not localise to the organelles whose movement they control, raising the issue of how specificity is determined. Here we show that a MyoB myosin receptor, MRF7, specifically localises to the Golgi membrane and affects its movement. Myosin XI-K was identified as a putative MRF7 interactor through mass spectrometry analysis. Co-expression of MRF7 and XI-K tail triggers the relocation of XI-K to the Golgi, linking a MyoB/myosin complex to a specific organelle in Arabidopsis. FRET-FLIM confirmed the in vivo interaction between MRF7 and XI-K tail on the Golgi and in the cytosol, suggesting that myosin/myosin receptor complexes perhaps cycle on and off organelle membranes. This work supports a traditional mechanism for organelle movement where myosins bind to receptors and adaptors on the organelle membranes, allowing them to actively move on the actin cytoskeleton, rather than passively in the recently proposed cytoplasmic streaming model.
PXD027834	34646142	Water-Soluble Tomato Extract Fruitflow Alters the Phosphoproteomic Profile of Collagen-Stimulated Platelets. 	Water-soluble tomato extract Fruitflow alters the phosphoproteomic profile of collagen-stimulated platelets	Fruitflow, platelets	Platelet hyperactivity is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and thrombosis. Recent studies reported that the tomato extract Fruitflow inhibited platelet function, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. The present study used proteomics to quantitatively analyze the effect of fruitflow on the inhibition of collagen-stimulated platelets and validated the involvement of several signaling molecules. Fruitflow significantly inhibited human platelet aggregation and P-selectin expression that were induced by collagen. Proteomics analysis revealed that compared fruitflow-treated collagen-stimulated platelets with only collagen-stimulated platelets, 60 proteins were upregulated and 10 proteins were downregulated. Additionally, 66 phosphorylated peptides were upregulated, whereas 37 phosphorylated peptides were downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that fruitflow treatment downregulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B and guanosine triphosphatase-mediated signal transduction in collagen-activated platelets. Biological validation indicated that fruitflow decreased Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and heat shock protein (Hsp27) phosphorylation in collagen-stimulated platelets. Fruitflow recovered cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels in collagen-activated platelets and reduced protein kinase A substrate phosphorylation that was induced by collagen. These findings suggest that fruitflow is a functional food that can inhibit platelet function, conferring beneficial effects for people who are at risk for platelet hyperactivity-associated thrombosis.
PXD025052	34646394	Proteomic analysis of lung cancer cells reveals a critical role of BCAT1 in cancer cell metastasis. 	Proteomic analysis of primary tumor and lymph metastatic  tissues as well as  lung cancer cells	A549, TMT, lung, lymph	Metastasis is the major cause of high mortality in lung cancer. Exploring the underlying mechanisms of metastasis thus holds promise for identifying new therapeutic strategies that may enhance survival. Methods: We applied quantitative mass spectrometry to compare protein expression profiles between primary and metastatic lung cancer cells whilst investigating metastasis-related molecular features. Results: We discovered that BCAT1, the key enzyme in branched-chain amino acid metabolism, is overexpressed at the protein level in metastatic lung cancer cells, as well as in metastatic tissues from lung cancer patients. Analysis of transcriptomic data available in the TCGA database revealed that increased BCAT1 transcription is associated with poor overall survival of lung cancer patients. In accord with a critical role in metastasis, shRNA-mediated knockdown of BCAT1 expression reduced migration of metastatic cells in vitro and the metastasis of these cells to distal organs in nude mice. Mechanistically, high levels of BCAT1 depleted alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) and promoted expression of SOX2, a transcription factor regulating cancer cell stemness and metastasis. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that BCAT1 plays an important role in promoting lung cancer cell metastasis, and may define a novel pathway to target as an anti-metastatic therapy.
PXD028038	34647461	Mass Dynamics 1.0: A Streamlined, Web-Based Environment for Analyzing, Sharing, and Integrating Label-Free Data. 	Mass Dynamics 1.0: A streamlined, web-based environment for analyzing, sharing and integrating Label-Free Data	MaxQuant, automated data analysis, benchmarking, label-free quantification, web-based software tool	Label-free quantification (LFQ) of shotgun proteomics data is a popular and robust method for the characterization of relative protein abundance between samples. Many analytical pipelines exist for the automation of this analysis, and some tools exist for the subsequent representation and inspection of the results of these pipelines. Mass Dynamics 1.0 (MD 1.0) is a web-based analysis environment that can analyze and visualize LFQ data produced by software such as MaxQuant. Unlike other tools, MD 1.0 utilizes a cloud-based architecture to enable researchers to store their data, enabling researchers to not only automatically process and visualize their LFQ data but also annotate and share their findings with collaborators and, if chosen, to easily publish results to the community. With a view toward increased reproducibility and standardization in proteomics data analysis and streamlining collaboration between researchers, MD 1.0 requires minimal parameter choices and automatically generates quality control reports to verify experiment integrity. Here, we demonstrate that MD 1.0 provides reliable results for protein expression quantification, emulating Perseus on benchmark datasets over a wide dynamic range. The MD 1.0 platform is available globally via: https://app.massdynamics.com/.
PXD026948	34648346	Mitochondrial translation is required for sustained killing by cytotoxic T cells. 	Doxycycline treated cytotoxic T lymphocytes	CTL, DIA, T cell, doxycycline, mitochondria, protein translation	T cell receptor activation of naive CD8(+) T lymphocytes initiates their maturation into effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which can kill cancer and virally infected cells. Although CTLs show an increased reliance on glycolysis upon acquisition of effector function, we found an essential requirement for mitochondria in target cell-killing. Acute mitochondrial depletion in USP30 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 30)-deficient CTLs markedly diminished killing capacity, although motility, signaling, and secretion were all intact. Unexpectedly, the mitochondrial requirement was linked to mitochondrial translation, inhibition of which impaired CTL killing. Impaired mitochondrial translation triggered attenuated cytosolic translation, precluded replenishment of secreted killing effectors, and reduced the capacity of CTLs to carry out sustained killing. Thus, mitochondria emerge as a previously unappreciated homeostatic regulator of protein translation required for serial CTL killing.
PXD027368	34650047	Morc3 silences endogenous retroviruses by enabling Daxx-mediated histone H3.3 incorporation. 	Morc3 silences endogenous retroviruses by enabling Daxx-mediated histone H3.3 incorporation	Daxx, ERV, Morc3, Setdb1, endogenous retroviruses, histone H3.3	Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) comprise a significant portion of mammalian genomes. Although specific ERV loci feature regulatory roles for host gene expression, most ERV integrations are transcriptionally repressed by Setdb1-mediated H3K9me3 and DNA methylation. However, the protein network which regulates the deposition of these chromatin modifications is still incompletely understood. Here, we perform a genome-wide single guide RNA (sgRNA) screen for genes involved in ERV silencing and identify the GHKL ATPase protein Morc3 as a top-scoring hit. Morc3 knock-out (ko) cells display de-repression, reduced H3K9me3, and increased chromatin accessibility of distinct ERV families. We find that the Morc3 ATPase cycle and Morc3 SUMOylation are important for ERV chromatin regulation. Proteomic analyses reveal that Morc3 mutant proteins fail to interact with the histone H3.3 chaperone Daxx. This interaction depends on Morc3 SUMOylation and Daxx SUMO binding. Notably, in Morc3 ko cells, we observe strongly reduced histone H3.3 on Morc3 binding sites. Thus, our data demonstrate Morc3 as a critical regulator of Daxx-mediated histone H3.3 incorporation to ERV regions.
PXD026963	34650057	Hexokinase 2-driven glycolysis in pericytes activates their contractility leading to tumor blood vessel abnormalities. 	Human tumor pericyte protein mass spectrometry	pericyte	Defective pericyte-endothelial cell interaction in tumors leads to a chaotic, poorly organized and dysfunctional vasculature. However, the underlying mechanism behind this is poorly studied. Herein, we develop a method that combines magnetic beads and flow cytometry cell sorting to isolate pericytes from tumors and normal adjacent tissues from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Pericytes from tumors show defective blood vessel supporting functions when comparing to those obtained from normal tissues. Mechanistically, combined proteomics and metabolic flux analysis reveals elevated hexokinase 2(HK2)-driven glycolysis in tumor pericytes, which up-regulates their ROCK2-MLC2 mediated contractility leading to impaired blood vessel supporting function. Clinically, high percentage of HK2 positive pericytes in blood vessels correlates with poor patient overall survival in NSCLC and HCC. Administration of a HK2 inhibitor induces pericyte-MLC2 driven tumor vasculature remodeling leading to enhanced drug delivery and efficacy against tumor growth. Overall, these data suggest that glycolysis in tumor pericytes regulates their blood vessel supporting role.
PXD026995	34650978	Increased Nuclear Transporter Importin 7 Contributes to the Tumor Growth and Correlates With CD8 T Cell Infiltration in Cervical Cancer. 	Increased Nuclear Transporter IPO7 Contributes to the Tumor Growth and Correlates with CD8 T cell Infiltration in Cervical Cancer	Cervical Cancer., IPO7, Immune infiltration	Background: Importin 7 (IPO7), a karyopherin-beta protein, is involved in various tumorigenesis and progression abilities by mediating the nuclear import of oncoproteins. However, the exact biological functions of IPO7 remain to be further elucidated. Materials and Methods: TCGA and GEO datasets were used to identify dysregulated expression of IPO7 in various cancers. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses were used to identify the oncogenic functions of IPO7 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, LC-MS/MS and parallel reaction monitoring analysis were used to comparatively profiled IPO7-related proteomics and potential molecular machinery. Results: Our works demonstrated that the expression of IPO7 was upregulated and was correlated with a poor prognosis in cervical cancer. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that knockdown of IPO7 inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and C-4 I cells. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that IPO7-related cargo proteins mainly were enriched in gene transcription regulation. Then independent PRM analysis for the first time demonstrated that 32 novel IPO7 cargo proteins, such as GTF2I, RORC1, PSPC1, and RBM25. Moreover, IPO7 contributed to activating the PI3K/AKT-mTOR pathway by mediating the nuclear import of GTF2I in cervical cancer cells. Intriguingly, we found that the IPO7 expression was negatively correlated with CD8 T cell infiltration via regulating the expression of CD276 in cervical cancer. Conclusion: This study enhances our understanding of IPO7 nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation and might reveal novel potential therapeutic targets. The results of a negative correlation between the IPO7 and CD8 T cell infiltration indicate that the IPO7 might play an important impact on the immune microenvironment of cervical cancer.
PXD028022	34650982	Calcium Binding Protein S100A16 Expedites Proliferation, Invasion and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Process in Gastric Cancer. 	Proteomic analysis in S100A16-overexpressed human gastric cancer cells lines	Gastric cancer, S100A16, SGC-7901 cells	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive system, listed as the second cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. S100 Calcium Binding Protein A16 (S100A16) is an acidic calcium-binding protein associated with several types of tumor progression. However, the function of S100A16 in GC is still not very clear. In this study, we analyzed S100A16 expression with the GEPIA database and the UALCAN cancer database. Meanwhile, 100 clinical GC samples were used for the evaluation of its role in the prognostic analysis. We found that S100A16 is significantly upregulated in GC tissues and closely correlated with poor prognosis in GC patients. Functional studies reveal that S100A16 overexpression triggers GC cell proliferation and migration both in vivo and in vitro; by contrast, S100A16 knockdown restricts the speed of GC cell growth and mobility. Proteomic analysis results reveal a large S100A16 interactome, which includes ZO-2 (Zonula Occludens-2), a master regulator of cell-to-cell tight junctions. Mechanistic assay results indicate that excessive S100A16 instigates GC cell invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via ZO-2 inhibition, which arose from S100A16-mediated ZO-2 ubiquitination and degradation. Our results not only reveal that S100A16 is a promising candidate biomarker in GC early diagnosis and prediction of metastasis, but also establish the therapeutic importance of targeting S100A16 to prevent ZO-2 loss and suppress GC metastasis and progression.
PXD027352	34654813	Sub-centrosomal mapping identifies augmin-gammaTuRC as part of a centriole-stabilizing scaffold. 	Sub-centrosomal mapping identifies augmin-ï§TuRC as part of a centriole-stabilizing scaffold	augmin, centriole, ciliogenesis, microtubules, ï§TuRC	Centriole biogenesis and maintenance are crucial for cells to generate cilia and assemble centrosomes that function as microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). Centriole biogenesis and MTOC function both require the microtubule nucleator gamma-tubulin ring complex (gammaTuRC). It is widely accepted that gammaTuRC nucleates microtubules from the pericentriolar material that is associated with the proximal part of centrioles. However, gammaTuRC also localizes more distally and in the centriole lumen, but the significance of these findings is unclear. Here we identify spatially and functionally distinct subpopulations of centrosomal gammaTuRC. Luminal localization is mediated by augmin, which is linked to the centriole inner scaffold through POC5. Disruption of luminal localization impairs centriole integrity and interferes with cilium assembly. Defective ciliogenesis is also observed in gammaTuRC mutant fibroblasts from a patient suffering from microcephaly with chorioretinopathy. These results identify a non-canonical role of augmin-gammaTuRC in the centriole lumen that is linked to human disease.
PXD018104	34654883	The loss of DHX15 impairs endothelial energy metabolism, lymphatic drainage and tumor metastasis in mice. 	The loss of the RNA helicase Dhx15 impairs endothelial energy metabolism, lymphatic drainage and tumor metastasis in mice	LTQ-Orbitrap Fusion Lumos	DHX15 is a downstream substrate for Akt1, which is involved in key cellular processes affecting vascular biology. Here, we explored the vascular regulatory function of DHX15. Homozygous DHX15 gene deficiency was lethal in mouse and zebrafish embryos. DHX15(-/-) zebrafish also showed downregulation of VEGF-C and reduced formation of lymphatic structures during development. DHX15(+/-) mice depicted lower vascular density and impaired lymphatic function postnatally. RNAseq and proteome analysis of DHX15 silenced endothelial cells revealed differential expression of genes involved in the metabolism of ATP biosynthesis. The validation of these results demonstrated a lower activity of the Complex I in the mitochondrial membrane of endothelial cells, resulting in lower intracellular ATP production and lower oxygen consumption. After injection of syngeneic LLC1 tumor cells, DHX15(+/-) mice showed partially inhibited primary tumor growth and reduced lung metastasis. Our results revealed an important role of DHX15 in vascular physiology and pave a new way to explore its potential use as a therapeutical target for metastasis treatment.
PXD025579	34655299	Extracellular vesicle proteomes of two transmissible cancers of Tasmanian devils reveal tenascin-C as a serum-based differential diagnostic biomarker. 	Tasmanian devil facial tumour-derived extracellular vesicles reveal mesenchymal transition markers and adhesion molecules related to metastasis.	Tasmanian devils, biomarker, devil facial tumour Disease, exosomes, extracellular vesicles, marsupials, mesenchymal markers, metastasis, veterinary medicine.	The iconic Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is endangered due to the transmissible cancer Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), of which there are two genetically independent subtypes (DFT1 and DFT2). While DFT1 and DFT2 can be differentially diagnosed using tumour biopsies, there is an urgent need to develop less-invasive biomarkers that can detect DFTD and distinguish between subtypes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), the nano-sized membrane-enclosed vesicles present in most biofluids, represent a valuable resource for biomarker discovery. Here, we characterized the proteome of EVs from cultured DFTD cells using data-independent acquisition-mass spectrometry and an in-house spectral library of > 1500 proteins. EVs from both DFT1 and DFT2 cell lines expressed higher levels of proteins associated with focal adhesion functions. Furthermore, hallmark proteins of epithelial-mesenchymal transition were enriched in DFT2 EVs relative to DFT1 EVs. These findings were validated in EVs derived from serum samples, revealing that the mesenchymal marker tenascin-C was also enriched in EVs derived from the serum of devils infected with DFT2 relative to those infected with DFT1 and healthy controls. This first EV-based investigation of DFTD increases our understanding of the cancers' EVs and their possible involvement in DFTD progression, such as metastasis. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of EVs to differentiate between DFT1 and DFT2, highlighting their potential use as less-invasive liquid biopsies for the Tasmanian devil.
PXD023181	34655801	A Systematic Survey of the Light/Dark-dependent Protein Degradation Events in a Model Cyanobacterium. 	A systematic survey of the light-dependent protein quality control in a model cyanobacterium	Light-dependent, Light-independent, PQ pool, Protein degradation, Redox, Synechocystis	Light is essential for photosynthetic organisms and is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation. The significance of light-regulated protein degradation is exemplified by the well-established light-induced degradation and repair of the photosystem II reaction center D1 protein in higher plants and cyanobacteria. However, systematic studies of light-regulated protein degradation events in photosynthetic organisms are lacking. Thus, we conducted a large-scale survey of protein degradation under light or dark conditions in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter referred to as Synechocystis) using the isobaric labeling-based quantitative proteomics technique. The results revealed that 79 proteins showed light-regulated degradation, including proteins involved in photosystem II structure or function, quinone binding, and NADH dehydrogenase. Among these, 25 proteins were strongly dependent on light for degradation. Moreover, the light-dependent degradation of several proteins was sensitive to photosynthetic electron transport inhibitors (DCMU and DBMIB), suggesting that they are influenced by the redox state of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool. Together, our study comprehensively cataloged light-regulated protein degradation events, and the results serve as an important resource for future studies aimed at understanding light-regulated processes and protein quality control mechanisms in cyanobacteria.
PXD024896	34656094	Phosphoproteome analysis reveals an extensive phosphorylation of proteins associated with bast fiber growth in ramie. 	Phosphoproteome of ramie stem barks	Ramie,Phosphoproteome	BACKGROUND: Phosphorylation modification, one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins, widely participates in the regulation of plant growth and development. Fibers extracted from the stem bark of ramie are important natural textile fibers; however, the role of phosphorylation modification in the growth of ramie fibers is largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we report a phosphoproteome analysis for the barks from the top and middle section of ramie stems, in which the fiber grows at different stages. A total of 10,320 phosphorylation sites from 9,170 unique phosphopeptides that were assigned to 3,506 proteins was identified, and 458 differentially phosphorylated sites from 323 proteins were detected in the fiber developmental barks. Twelve differentially phosphorylated proteins were the homologs of Arabidopsis fiber growth-related proteins. We further focused on the function of the differentially phosphorylated KNOX protein whole_GLEAN_10029667, and found that this protein dramatically repressed the fiber formation in Arabidopsis. Additionally, using a yeast two-hybridization assay, we identified a kinase and a phosphatase that interact with whole_GLEAN_10029667, indicating that they potentially target this KNOX protein to regulate its phosphorylation level. CONCLUSION: The finding of this study provided insights into the involvement of phosphorylation modification in ramie fiber growth, and our functional characterization of whole_GLEAN_10029667 provide the first evidence to indicate the involvement of phosphorylation modification in the regulation of KNOX protein function in plants.
PXD028317	34658856	Sanye Tablet Ameliorates Insulin Resistance and Dysregulated Lipid Metabolism in High-Fat Diet-Induced Obese Mice. 	Proteomic detection of mouse liver	Liver	Sanye Tablet (SYT) is a patent prescription widely used in treating T2D and pre-diabetes, especially T2D comorbid with hypertriglyceridemia, for many years in China. However, the underlying mechanism that accounts for the anti-diabetic potential of SYT by regulating lipid-related intermediates remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of SYT on lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice by means of combining lipidomics and proteomics. The obese mice models were developed via HFD feeding for 20 consecutive weeks. Mice in the treatment group were given metformin and SYT respectively, and the effects of SYT on body weight, blood glucose, insulin sensitivity, fat accumulation in the organs, and pathological changes in the liver were monitored. Lipid metabolism was examined by lipidomics. Further determination of signaling pathways was detected by proteomics. The biological contributions of the compounds detected in SYT's chemical fingerprint were predicted by network pharmacology. SYT treatment reduced body weight, inhibited viscera and hepatic steatosis lipid accumulation, and prevented insulin resistance. Furthermore, it was found that circulatory inflammatory cytokines were reduced by SYT treatment. In addition, lipidomics analysis indicated that SYT targets lipid intermediates, including diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ceramide (Cer). Mechanistically, SYT positively affected these lipid intermediates by suppressing liver lipogenesis via downregulation of SREBP1/ACC and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Our results predicted that astragalin and rosmarinic acid might regulate the JAK-STAT pathway by targeting PIM2 and STAT1, respectively, while paeoniflorin and rosmarinic acid were likely to regulate inflammatory responses by targeting TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-4 during T2D. Overall, our study provides supportive evidence for the mechanism of SYT's therapeutic effect on dysregulated lipid metabolism in diabesity.
PXD025608	34658947	Label-Free Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Proteomic Analysis of the Urinary Proteome for Measuring the Escitalopram Treatment Response From Major Depressive Disorder. 	Identification of early candidate urine biomarkers for measure Escitalopram treatment response from major depressive disorder	Major depressive disorder (MDD), escitalopram, treatment response biomarkers, urine proteome	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder that can cause substantial impairments in quality of life. Clinical treatment is usually built on a trial-and-error method, which lasts ~12 weeks to evaluate whether the treatment is efficient, thereby leading to some inefficient treatment measures. Therefore, we intended to identify early candidate urine biomarkers to predict efficient treatment response in MDD patients. In this study, urine samples were collected twice from 19 respondent and 10 non-respondent MDD patients receiving 0-, 2-, and 12-week treatments with escitalopram. Differential urinary proteins were subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Our two pilot tests suggested that the urine proteome reflects changes associated with major depressive disorder at the early stage of treatment measures. On week 2, 20 differential proteins were identified in the response group compared with week 0, with 14 of these proteins being associated with the mechanisms of MDD. In the non-response group, 60 differential proteins were identified at week 2, with 28 of these proteins being associated with the mechanisms of MDD. In addition, differential urinary proteins at week 2 between the response and non-response groups can be clearly distinguished by using orthogonal projection on latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Our small pilot tests indicated that the urine proteome can reflect early effects of escitalopram therapy between the response and non-response groups since at week 2, which may provide potential early candidate urine biomarkers to predict efficient treatment measures in MDD patients.
PXD027208	34659171	Phosphorylation of Extracellular Proteins in Acinetobacter baumannii in Sessile Mode of Growth. 	Phosphorylation of extracellular proteins in Acinetobacter baumannii in sessile mode of growth	Acinetobacter baumannii, biofilm, extracellular proteins, phosphorylation	Acinetobacter baumannii is a problematic nosocomial pathogen owing to its increasing resistance to antibiotics and its great ability to survive in the hospital environment, which is linked to its capacity to form biofilms. Structural and functional investigations of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylations, may lead to identification of candidates for therapeutic targets against this pathogen. Here, we present the first S/T/Y phosphosecretome of two A. baumannii strains, the reference strain ATCC 17978 and the virulent multi-drug resistant strain AB0057, cultured in two modes of growth (planktonic and biofilm) using TiO2 chromatography followed by high resolution mass spectrometry. In ATCC 17978, we detected a total of 137 (97 phosphoproteins) and 52 (33 phosphoproteins) phosphosites in biofilm and planktonic modes of growth, respectively. Similarly, in AB0057, 155 (119 phosphoproteins) and 102 (74 phosphoproteins) phosphosites in biofilm and planktonic modes of growth were identified, respectively. Both strains in the biofilm mode of growth showed a higher number of phosphosites and phosphoproteins compared to planktonic growth. Several phosphorylated sites are localized in key regions of proteins involved in either drug resistance (beta-lactamases), adhesion to host tissues (pilins), or protein secretion (Hcp). Site-directed mutagenesis of the Hcp protein, essential for type VI secretion system-mediated interbacterial competition, showed that four of the modified residues are essential for type VI secretion system activity.
PXD026300	34659206	Shotgun Immunoproteomic Approach for the Discovery of Linear B-Cell Epitopes in Biothreat Agents Francisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei. 	Shotgun Immunoproteomic Approach for the Discovery of Linear B Cell Epitopes in Biothreat Agents Francisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei	B cell epitope, Burkholderia, Francisella, antigen, immunoproteome, peptide vaccine	Peptide-based subunit vaccines are coming to the forefront of current vaccine approaches, with safety and cost-effective production among their top advantages. Peptide vaccine formulations consist of multiple synthetic linear epitopes that together trigger desired immune responses that can result in robust immune memory. The advantages of linear compared to conformational epitopes are their simple structure, ease of synthesis, and ability to stimulate immune responses by means that do not require complex 3D conformation. Prediction of linear epitopes through use of computational tools is fast and cost-effective, but typically of low accuracy, necessitating extensive experimentation to verify results. On the other hand, identification of linear epitopes through experimental screening has been an inefficient process that requires thorough characterization of previously identified full-length protein antigens, or laborious techniques involving genetic manipulation of organisms. In this study, we apply a newly developed generalizable screening method that enables efficient identification of B-cell epitopes in the proteomes of pathogenic bacteria. As a test case, we used this method to identify epitopes in the proteome of Francisella tularensis (Ft), a Select Agent with a well-characterized immunoproteome. Our screen identified many peptides that map to known antigens, including verified and predicted outer membrane proteins and extracellular proteins, validating the utility of this approach. We then used the method to identify seroreactive peptides in the less characterized immunoproteome of Select Agent Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp). This screen revealed known Bp antigens as well as proteins that have not been previously identified as antigens. Although B-cell epitope prediction tools Bepipred 2.0 and iBCE-EL classified many of our seroreactive peptides as epitopes, they did not score them significantly higher than the non-reactive tryptic peptides in our study, nor did they assign higher scores to seroreactive peptides from known Ft or Bp antigens, highlighting the need for experimental data instead of relying on computational epitope predictions alone. The present workflow is easily adaptable to detecting peptide targets relevant to the immune systems of other mammalian species, including humans (depending upon the availability of convalescent sera from patients), and could aid in accelerating the discovery of B-cell epitopes and development of vaccines to counter emerging biological threats.
PXD022919	34659547	Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals sophisticated metabolic alteration and identifies FMNL1 as a prognostic marker in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. 	Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals sophisticated metabolic alteration and identifies FMNL1 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in clear cell renal cell carcinoma	FMNL1, ccRCC, energy metabolism, prognosis	Purpose: In this study, we have undertaken the whole proteomic analysis and got a better understanding of biological processes involved in the development and progression of ccRCC. We hope promising biomarkers can be uncovered to facilitate early diagnosis, predict the prognosis and progression, more importantly, to be applied as potential therapeutic targets. Experimental design: Fresh frozen tissue samples were surgically resected from patients with local or locally advanced ccRCC. Trypsin digested proteins were analyzed using TMT-based LC-MS/MS proteomic approach, followed by bioinformatic analysis. A potential prognostic marker FMNL1 was chosen to be validated in TCGA_KIRC datasets (n=525 and 72), further validation sets (n=10 and 10) and expanded validation sets (n=81 and 16). The effects of FMNL1 on proliferation, migration and invasion were determined by colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays in 786-O and Caki-1 cells in vitro study. Results: A total of 657 differentially expressed proteins were identified and quantified between ccRCC and adjacent normal tissues (p-value<0.05, FC>2 or<1/2), of which 186 proteins were up-regulated and 471 proteins were down-regulated. Bioinformatic analysis showed enriched metabolic biological processes and pathways. Univariate and multivariate analysis defined FMNL1 as an independent negative prognostic marker in the TCGA datasets. High expression of FMNL1 correlated significantly with tumor stage and distant metastasis (P<0.05) both in the TCGA-KIRC datasets and expanded validation sets. Kaplan-Meier survival curve illustrated that the patients with high FMNL1 protein level had shorter OS time in the expanded validation sets (p=0.0273). In vitro experiments presented the functional effects of FMNL1 knockdown on the inhibition of proliferation, migration and invasion in cancer cell lines. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The proteomic results uncovered sophisticated metabolic reprogramming of ccRCC and indicated that the upregulation of rate-limiting enzymes in glycolysis and mitochondrial impairment may be the cause of metabolic reprogramming in ccRCC. Moreover, FMNL1 has been identified as a promising prognostic marker, and knockdown of FMNL1 could inhibit ccRCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, which might be used as a new effective therapeutic strategy to inhibit the progression of ccRCC.
PXD026117	34660568	Global SUMOylome Adjustments in Basal Defenses of Arabidopsis thaliana Involve Complex Interplay Between SMALL-UBIQUITIN LIKE MODIFIERs and the Negative Immune Regulator SUPPRESSOR OF rps4-RLD1. 	LC-MS analysis of in vitro SUMOylated SRFR1 protein.	SRFR1, SUMOylation	Steady-state SUMOylome of a plant is adjusted locally during developmental transitions and more globally during stress exposures. We recently reported that basal immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana against Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato strain DC3000 (PstDC3000) is associated with strong enhancements in the net SUMOylome. Transcriptional upregulations of SUMO conjugases, suppression of protease, and increased SUMO translations accounted for this enhanced SUMOylation. Antagonistic roles of SUMO1/2 and SUMO3 isoforms further fine-tuned the SUMOylome adjustments, thus impacting defense amplitudes and immune outcomes. Loss of function of SUPPRESSOR OF rps4-RLD1 (SRFR1), a previously reported negative regulator of basal defenses, also caused constitutive increments in global SUMO-conjugates through similar modes. These suggest that SRFR1 plays a pivotal role in maintenance of SUMOylation homeostasis and its dynamic changes during immune elicitations. Here, we demonstrate that SRFR1 degradation kinetically precedes and likely provides the salicylic acid (SA) elevations necessary for the SUMOylome increments in basal defenses. We show that SRFR1 not only is a SUMOylation substrate but also interacts in planta with both SUMO1 and SUMO3. In sum1 or sum3 mutants, SRFR1 stabilities are reduced albeit by different modes. Whereas a srfr1 sum1 combination is lethal, the srfr1 sum3 plants retain developmental defects and enhanced immunity of the srfr1 parent. Together with increasing evidence of SUMOs self-regulating biochemical efficiencies of SUMOylation-machinery, we present their impositions on SRFR1 expression that in turn counter-modulates the SUMOylome. Overall, our investigations reveal multifaceted dynamics of regulated SUMOylome changes via SRFR1 in defense-developmental balance.
PXD025004	34661239	Proteomic analysis of dietary restriction in yeast reveals a role for Hsp26 in replicative lifespan extension. 	Proteomic analysis of dietary restriction in yeast reveals a role for Hsp26 in lifespan extension C4PR_LIV	Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aging, calorie restriction, chaperone, mitochondria	Dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to increase lifespan in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. This suggests that the underlying mechanisms may be evolutionarily conserved. Indeed, upstream signalling pathways, such as TOR, are strongly linked to DR-induced longevity in various organisms. However, the downstream effector proteins that ultimately mediate lifespan extension are less clear. To shed light on this, we used a proteomic approach on budding yeast. Our reasoning was that analysis of proteome-wide changes in response to DR might enable the identification of proteins that mediate its physiological effects, including replicative lifespan extension. Of over 2500 proteins we identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, 183 were significantly altered in expression by at least 3-fold in response to DR. Most of these proteins were mitochondrial and/or had clear links to respiration and metabolism. Indeed, direct analysis of oxygen consumption confirmed that mitochondrial respiration was increased several-fold in response to DR. In addition, several key proteins involved in mating, including Ste2 and Ste6, were down-regulated by DR. Consistent with this, shmoo formation in response to alpha-factor pheromone was reduced by DR, thus confirming the inhibitory effect of DR on yeast mating. Finally, we found that Hsp26, a member of the conserved small heat shock protein (sHSP) family, was up-regulated by DR and that overexpression of Hsp26 extended yeast replicative lifespan. As overexpression of sHSPs in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila has previously been shown to extend lifespan, our data on yeast Hsp26 suggest that sHSPs may be universally conserved effectors of longevity.
PXD024476	34662580	Neddylation modification of the U3 snoRNA-binding protein RRP9 by Smurf1 promotes tumorigenesis. 	IP-MS data of potential Smurf1-interacting proteins	IP-MS, Smurf1	Neddylation is a posttranslational modification that attaches ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to protein targets via Nedd8-specific E1-E2-E3 enzymes and modulates many important biological processes. Nedd8 attaches to a lysine residue of a substrate, not for degradation, but for modulation of substrate activity. We previously identified the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, which controls diverse cellular processes, is activated by Nedd8 through covalent neddylation. Smurf1 functions as a thioester bond-type Nedd8 ligase to catalyze its own neddylation. Numerous ubiquitination substrates of Smurf1 have been identified, but the neddylation substrates of Smurf1 remain unknown. Here, we show that Smurf1 interacts with RRP9, a core component of the U3 snoRNP complex, which is involved in pre-rRNA processing. Our in vivo and in vitro neddylation modification assays show that RRP9 is conjugated with Nedd8. RRP9 neddylation is catalyzed by Smurf1 and removed by the NEDP1 deneddylase. We identified Lys221 as a major neddylation site on RRP9. Deficiency of RRP9 neddylation inhibits pre-rRNA processing and leads to downregulation of ribosomal biogenesis. Consequently, functional studies suggest that ectopic expression of RRP9 promotes tumor cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration, whereas unneddylated RRP9, K221R mutant has no such effect. Furthermore, in human colorectal cancer, elevated expression of RRP9 and Smurf1 correlates with cancer progression. These results reveal that Smurf1 plays a multifaceted role in pre-rRNA processing by catalyzing RRP9 neddylation and shed new light on the oncogenic role of RRP9.
PXD027043	34663701	Molecular insights into mechanisms of GPCR hijacking by Staphylococcus aureus. 	Molecular insights into mechanisms of GPCR hijacking by Staphylococcus aureus	GPCR, host-pathogen interactions, pharmacology, structural mass spectrometry	Atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) targeted by Staphylococcus aureus bicomponent pore-forming leukotoxins to promote bacterial growth and immune evasion. Here, we have developed an integrative molecular pharmacology and structural biology approach in order to characterize the effect of leukotoxins HlgA and HlgB on ACKR1 structure and function. Interestingly, using cell-based assays and native mass spectrometry, we found that both components HlgA and HlgB compete with endogenous chemokines through a direct binding with the extracellular domain of ACKR1. Unexpectedly, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry analysis revealed that toxin binding allosterically modulates the intracellular G protein-binding domain of the receptor, resulting in dissociation and/or changes in the architecture of ACKR1-Galphai1 protein complexes observed in living cells. Altogether, our study brings important molecular insights into the initial steps of leukotoxins targeting a host GPCR.
PXD018887	34663987	Mutations and variants of ONECUT1 in diabetes. 	Mutations and variants of ONECUT1 in diabetes	Onecut1, differentiation, stem cells	Genes involved in distinct diabetes types suggest shared disease mechanisms. Here we show that One Cut Homeobox 1 (ONECUT1) mutations cause monogenic recessive syndromic diabetes in two unrelated patients, characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, pancreas hypoplasia and gallbladder agenesis/hypoplasia, and early-onset diabetes in heterozygous relatives. Heterozygous carriers of rare coding variants of ONECUT1 define a distinctive subgroup of diabetic patients with early-onset, nonautoimmune diabetes, who respond well to diabetes treatment. In addition, common regulatory ONECUT1 variants are associated with multifactorial type 2 diabetes. Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells revealed that loss of ONECUT1 impairs pancreatic progenitor formation and a subsequent endocrine program. Loss of ONECUT1 altered transcription factor binding and enhancer activity and NKX2.2/NKX6.1 expression in pancreatic progenitor cells. Collectively, we demonstrate that ONECUT1 controls a transcriptional and epigenetic machinery regulating endocrine development, involved in a spectrum of diabetes, encompassing monogenic (recessive and dominant) as well as multifactorial inheritance. Our findings highlight the broad contribution of ONECUT1 in diabetes pathogenesis, marking an important step toward precision diabetes medicine.
PXD027864	34664012	Acetylation Profiles in the Metabolic Process of Glioma-Associated Seizures. 	Acetylation profiles in the metabolic process of glioma-associated seizures	Lysine acetylation, glioma-associated seizures, metabolic process	Objective: We test the hypothesis that lysine acetylation is involved in the metabolic process of glioma-associated seizures (GAS). Methods: We used label-free mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics to quantify dynamic changes of protein acetylation between gliomas with seizure (CA1 group) and gliomas without seizure (CA2 group). Furthermore, differences of acetyltransferase and deacetylase expression between CA1 and CA2 groups were performed by a quantitative proteomic study. We further classified acetylated proteins into groups according to cell component, molecular function, and biological process. In addition, metabolic pathways and protein interaction networks were analyzed. Regulated acetyltransferases and acetylated profiles were validated by PRM and Western blot. Results: We detected 169 downregulated lysine acetylation sites of 134 proteins and 39 upregulated lysine acetylation sites of 35 proteins in glioma with seizures based on acetylome. We detected 407 regulated proteins by proteomics, from which ACAT2 and ACAA2 were the differentially regulated enzymes in the acetylation of GAS. According to the KEGG analysis, the upregulated acetylated proteins within the PPIs were mapped to pathways involved in the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, biosynthesis of amino acids, and carbon metabolism. The downregulated acetylated proteins within the PPIs were mapped to pathways involved in fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle, and necroptosis. Regulated ACAT2 expression and acetylated profiles were validated by PRM and Western blot. Conclusions: The data support the hypothesis that regulated protein acetylation is involved in the metabolic process of GAS, which may be induced by acetyl-CoA acetyltransferases.
PXD026833	34664350	A role for PchHI as the ABC transporter in iron acquisition by the siderophore pyochelin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 	A role for PchHI as an ABC transporter in iron acquisition by the siderophore pyochelin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	PchHI, Pseudomonas, iron, pyochelin, siderophore	Iron is an essential nutrient for bacterial growth but poorly bioavailable. Bacteria scavenge ferric iron by synthesizing and secreting siderophores, small compounds with a high affinity for iron. Pyochelin (PCH) is one of the two siderophores produced by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After capturing a ferric iron molecule, PCH-Fe is imported back into bacteria first by the outer membrane transporter FptA and then by the inner membrane permease FptX. Here, using molecular biology, (55) Fe uptake assays, and LC-MS/MS quantification, we first find a role for PchHI as the heterodimeric ABC transporter involved in the siderophore-free iron uptake into the bacterial cytoplasm. We also provide the first evidence that PCH is able to reach the bacterial periplasm and cytoplasm when both FptA and FptX are expressed. Finally, we detected an interaction between PchH and FptX, linking the ABC transporter PchHI with the inner permease FptX in the PCH-Fe uptake pathway. These results pave the way for a better understanding of the PCH siderophore pathway, giving future directions to tackle P. aeruginosa infections.
PXD026292	34667177	PHF3 regulates neuronal gene expression through the Pol II CTD reader domain SPOC. 	FLAG-PHF3 interactome in HEK293 cells	NanoLC-MS analysis, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation, on-bead digest	The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a regulatory hub for transcription and RNA processing. Here, we identify PHD-finger protein 3 (PHF3) as a regulator of transcription and mRNA stability that docks onto Pol II CTD through its SPOC domain. We characterize SPOC as a CTD reader domain that preferentially binds two phosphorylated Serine-2 marks in adjacent CTD repeats. PHF3 drives liquid-liquid phase separation of phosphorylated Pol II, colocalizes with Pol II clusters and tracks with Pol II across the length of genes. PHF3 knock-out or SPOC deletion in human cells results in increased Pol II stalling, reduced elongation rate and an increase in mRNA stability, with marked derepression of neuronal genes. Key neuronal genes are aberrantly expressed in Phf3 knock-out mouse embryonic stem cells, resulting in impaired neuronal differentiation. Our data suggest that PHF3 acts as a prominent effector of neuronal gene regulation by bridging transcription with mRNA decay.
PXD028540	34667203	Regulation of local GTP availability controls RAC1 activity and cell invasion. 	Local GTP availability is an essential step in regulation of RAC1 activity and cell invasion	GTP, GTP sensors, IMPDH2, RAC1	Physiological changes in GTP levels in live cells have never been considered a regulatory step of RAC1 activation because intracellular GTP concentration (determined by chromatography or mass spectrometry) was shown to be substantially higher than the in vitro RAC1 GTP dissociation constant (RAC1-GTP Kd). Here, by combining genetically encoded GTP biosensors and a RAC1 activity biosensor, we demonstrated that GTP levels fluctuating around RAC1-GTP Kd correlated with changes in RAC1 activity in live cells. Furthermore, RAC1 co-localized in protrusions of invading cells with several guanylate metabolism enzymes, including rate-limiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2), which was partially due to direct RAC1-IMPDH2 interaction. Substitution of endogenous IMPDH2 with IMPDH2 mutants incapable of binding RAC1 did not affect total intracellular GTP levels but suppressed RAC1 activity. Targeting IMPDH2 away from the plasma membrane did not alter total intracellular GTP pools but decreased GTP levels in cell protrusions, RAC1 activity, and cell invasion. These data provide a mechanism of regulation of RAC1 activity by local GTP pools in live cells.
PXD026668	34667212	UV induced changes in proteome of rats plasma are reversed by dermally applied cannabidiol. 	UV induced changes in proteome of rats plasma are reversed by dermally applied cannabidiol	UV radiation, dermal application of cannabidiol, lipid peroxidation product-protein adducts, nude rats, plasma proteome, protein modifications	UV radiation is known to induce a multiple changes in the metabolism of skin-building cells, what can affect the functioning not only neighboring cells, but also, following signal transduction releasing into the blood vessels, the entire body. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the proteomic disturbances occurred in plasma of chronically UVA/UVB irradiated rats and define the effect on these changes of skin topically applied cannabidiol (CBD). Obtained results showed significant changes in the expression of numerous anti-inflammatory and signaling proteins including: NFkappaB inhibitor, 14-3-3 protein, protein kinase C, keratin, and protein S100 after UV irradiation and CBD treatment. Moreover, the effects of UVA and UVB were manifested by increased level of lipid peroxidation products-protein adducts formation. CBD partially prevented all of these changes, but in a various degree depending on the UV radiation type. Moreover, topical treatment with CBD resulted in the penetration of CBD into the blood and, as a consequence, in direct modifications to the plasma protein structure by creating CBD adducts with molecules, such as proline-rich protein 30, transcription factor 19, or N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase, what significantly changed the activity of these proteins. In conclusion, it may be suggested that CBD applied topically may be an effective compound against systemic UV-induced oxidative stress, but its effectiveness requires careful analysis of CBD's effects on other tissues of the living organism.
PXD021702	34667241	Identification of serum prognostic biomarkers of severe COVID-19 using a quantitative proteomic approach. 	Identification of serum prognostic biomarkers of severe COVID-19 using a quantitative proteomic approach	Biomarker, COVID-19, Diagnosis, Prognosis	The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented threat to humanity that has provoked global health concerns. Since the etiopathogenesis of this illness is not fully characterized, the prognostic factors enabling treatment decisions have not been well documented. Accurately predicting the progression of the disease would aid in appropriate patient categorization and thus help determine the best treatment option. Here, we have introduced a proteomic approach utilizing data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) to identify the serum proteins that are closely associated with COVID-19 prognosis. Twenty-seven proteins were differentially expressed between severely ill COVID-19 patients with an adverse or favorable prognosis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that 15 of the 27 proteins might be regulated by cytokine signaling relevant to interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and their differential expression was implicated in the systemic inflammatory response and in cardiovascular disorders. We further evaluated practical predictors of the clinical prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. Subsequent ELISA assays revealed that CHI3L1 and IGFALS may serve as highly sensitive prognostic markers. Our findings can help formulate a diagnostic approach for accurately identifying COVID-19 patients with severe disease and for providing appropriate treatment based on their predicted prognosis.
PXD024124	34668408	Lung proteomic biomarkers associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 	Lung proteomic biomarkers associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	Human COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease shotgun MS/MS	Identifying protein biomarkers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been challenging. Most previous studies have used individual proteins or preselected protein panels measured in blood samples. Mass spectrometry proteomic studies of lung tissue have been based on small sample sizes. We used mass spectrometry proteomic approaches to discover protein biomarkers from 150 lung tissue samples representing COPD cases and controls. Top COPD-associated proteins were identified based on multiple linear regression analysis with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. Correlations between pairs of COPD-associated proteins were examined. Machine learning models were also evaluated to identify potential combinations of protein biomarkers related to COPD. We identified 4,407 proteins passing quality controls. Twenty-five proteins were significantly associated with COPD at FDR < 0.05, including interleukin 33, ferritin (light chain and heavy chain), and two proteins related to caveolae (CAV1 and CAVIN1). Multiple previously reported plasma protein biomarkers for COPD were not significantly associated with proteomic analysis of COPD in lung tissue, although RAGE was borderline significant. Eleven pairs of top significant proteins were highly correlated (r > 0.8), including several strongly correlated with RAGE (EHD2 and CAVIN1). Machine learning models using Random Forests with the top 5% of protein biomarkers demonstrated reasonable accuracy (0.707) and area under the curve (0.714) for COPD prediction. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of lung tissue is a promising approach for the identification of biomarkers for COPD.
PXD027530	34669399	Adsorptive Microtiter Plates As Solid Supports in Affinity Purification Workflows. 	Adsorptive microtiter plates as solid supports in affinity purification workflows	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP5, Transcription factor p65, immuno capture	Affinity ligands such as antibodies are widely used in (bio)medical research for purifying proteins from complex biological samples. These ligands are generally immobilized onto solid supports which facilitate the separation of a captured protein from the sample matrix. Adsorptive microtiter plates are commonly used as solid supports prior to immunochemical detection (e.g., immunoassays) but hardly ever prior to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-)-based detection. Here, we describe the use of adsorptive microtiter plates for protein enrichment prior to LC-MS detection, and we discuss opportunities and challenges of corresponding workflows, based on examples of targeted (i.e., soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) in human serum) and discovery-based workflows (i.e., transcription factor p65 (NF-kappaB) in lysed murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP5 (FKBP5) in lysed human A549 alveolar basal epithelial cells). Thereby, we aim to highlight the potential usefulness of adsorptive microtiter plates in affinity purification workflows prior to LC-MS detection, which could increase their usage in mass spectrometry-based protein research.
PXD022721	34669412	Longitudinal Large-Scale Semiquantitative Proteomic Data Stability Across Multiple Instrument Platforms. 	: Robust and reproducible large-scale label-free deep quantitative profiling of the MOLM-14 surfaceome using three mass spectrometry platforms over multiple years	Label-free quantification, Large-scale, Quantitative proteomics, Reproducibility, Surfaceome	With the rapid developments in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics methods, label-free semiquantitative proteomics has become an increasingly popular tool for profiling global protein abundances in an unbiased manner. However, the reproducibility of these data across time and LC-MS platforms is not well characterized. Here, we evaluate the performance of three LC-MS platforms (Orbitrap Elite, Q Exactive HF, and Orbitrap Fusion) in label-free semiquantitative analysis of cell surface proteins over a six-year period. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was used for surfaceome enrichment, following gel separation for in-depth protein identification. With our established workflow, we consistently detected and reproducibly quantified >2300 putative cell surface proteins in a human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line on all three platforms. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting highly reproducible semiquantitative proteomic data collection of biological replicates across multiple years and LC-MS platforms. These data provide experimental justification for semiquantitative proteomic study designs that are executed over multiyear time intervals and on different platforms. Multiyear and multiplatform experimental designs will likely enable larger scale proteomic studies and facilitate longitudinal proteomic studies by investigators lacking access to high throughput MS facilities. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022721.
PXD024271	34669736	Urinary proteomics investigations into contrast-induced acute kidney injury. 	Urinary proteomics investigations into contrast-induced acute kidney injury	CI-AKI, bioinformatics analysis, biomarkers, urine proteins	Some patients have a decline in renal function after contrast medium injection, and this phenomenon is called contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI); a small number of people even suffer severe renal failure. To date, the mechanism of CI-AKI remains unclear. We aimed to identify novel potential biomarkers in the urine of patients with CI-AKI through LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis. We enrolled patients who underwent coronary angiography (contrast agent: iohexol). The CI-AKI group included 4 cases, and the non-CI-AKI group included 20 cases. We mixed the 4 CI-AKI samples and 20 non-CI-AKI samples. Then, a 0.6 ml urine sample was used for proteome analysis with LC-MS/MS approach. Metascape, ExPASy, and the Human Protein Atlas were utilized for bioinformatics analysis. We obtained 724 and 830 urine proteins from the CI-AKI and non-CI-AKI groups, respectively. The distribution of the pI values and molecular weights (MWs) of postoperative urine proteins showed no significant difference between the CI-AKI group and the non-CI-AKI group. A total of 99differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were detected, among which 18 proteins were detected only in tubule cells, and 19 proteins were detected in both tubule cells and glomeruli. With GO analysis, the GEPs were mainly associated with immune response and inflammation. Although biomarkers cannot be asserted from this single pilot study, our results may help advance the understanding of the mechanisms of CI-AKI and identify potential novel biomarkers for further investigation.
PXD024734	34669916	Proteomic Signatures of Human Visceral and Subcutaneous Adipocytes. 	Comparative proteomics of human visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes	adipocytes, adipose tissue, obesity, subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue	CONTEXT: Adipose tissue distribution is a key factor influencing metabolic health and risk in obesity-associated comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: Here we aim to compare the proteomic profiles of mature adipocytes from different depots. METHODS: Abdominal subcutaneous (SA) and omental visceral adipocytes (VA) were isolated from paired adipose tissue biopsies obtained during bariatric surgery on 19 severely obese women (body mass index > 30 kg/m2) and analyzed using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry. Differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were performed to investigate proteome signature properties and to examine a possible association of the protein expression with the clinical data. RESULTS: We identified 3686 protein groups and found 1140 differentially expressed proteins (adj. P value < 0.05), of which 576 proteins were upregulated in SA and 564 in VA samples. We provide a global protein profile of abdominal SA and omental VA, present the most differentially expressed pathways and processes distinguishing SA from VA, and correlate them with clinical and body composition data. We show that SA are significantly more active in processes linked to vesicular transport and secretion, and to increased lipid metabolism activity. Conversely, the expression of proteins involved in the mitochondrial energy metabolism and translational or biosynthetic activity is higher in VA. CONCLUSION: Our analysis represents a valuable resource of protein expression profiles in abdominal SA and omental VA, highlighting key differences in their role in obesity.
PXD024836	34671271	Improving Sperm Cryopreservation With Type III Antifreeze Protein: Proteomic Profiling of Cynomolgus Macaque (Macaca fascicularis) Sperm. 	Improving sperm cryopreservation with type III antifreeze proteins: effect on proteomic profiles of Cynomolgus macaque sperm	Cynomolgus macaques, antifreeze protein III, cryopreservation, proteomic profile, sperm	Antifreeze protein III (AFP III) is used for the cryopreservation of germ cells in various animal species. However, the exact mechanism of its cryoprotection is largely unknown at the molecular level. In this study, we investigated the motility, acrosomal integrity, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), as well as proteomic change, of cynomolgus macaque sperm after cryopreservation. Sperm motility, acrosomal integrity, and MMP were lower after cryopreservation (p < 0.001), but significant differences in sperm motility and MMP were observed between the AFP-treated sperm sample (Cryo+AFP) and the non-treated sample (Cryo-AFP) (p < 0.01). A total of 141 and 32 differentially expressed proteins were, respectively, identified in cynomolgus macaque sperm cryopreserved without and with 0.1 mug/ml AFP III compared with fresh sperm. These proteins were mainly involved in the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH) synthesis, and cell apoptosis. The addition of AFP III in the sperm freezing medium resulted in significant stabilization of cellular molecular functions and/or biological processes in sperm, as illustrated by the extent of proteomic changes after freezing and thawing. According to the proteomic change of differentially expressed proteins, we hypothesized a novel molecular mechanism for cryoprotection that AFP III may reduce the release of cytochrome c and thereby reduce sperm apoptosis by modulating the production of ROS in mitochondria. The molecular mechanism that AFP III acts with sperm proteins for cellular protection against cryoinjuries needs further study.
PXD024890	34671358	Identification of Differential Responses of Goat PBMCs to PPRV Virulence Using a Multi-Omics Approach. 	Goat Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) responses to infection vary with Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus virulence	Goat, Immune response, PBMC, Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus, Proteomics morbillivirus, Virulence	Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute transboundary infectious viral disease of small ruminants, mainly sheep and goats. Host susceptibility varies considerably depending on the PPR virus (PPRV) strain, the host species and breed. The effect of strains with different levels of virulence on the modulation of the immune system has not been thoroughly compared in an experimental setting so far. In this study, we used a multi-omics approach to investigate the host cellular factors involved in different infection phenotypes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Saanen goats were activated with a T-cell mitogen and infected with PPRV strains of different virulence: Morocco 2008 (high virulence), Ivory Coast 1989 (low virulence) and Nigeria 75/1 (live attenuated vaccine strain). Our results showed that the highly virulent strain replicated better than the other two in PBMCs and rapidly induced cell death and a stronger inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. However, all the strains affected lymphocyte proliferation and induced upregulation of key antiviral genes and proteins, meaning a classical antiviral response is orchestrated regardless of the virulence of the PPRV strain. On the other hand, the highly virulent strain induced stronger inflammatory responses and activated more genes related to lymphocyte migration and recruitment, and inflammatory processes. Both transcriptomic and proteomic approaches were successful in detecting viral and antiviral effectors under all conditions. The present work identified key immunological factors related to PPRV virulence in vitro.
PXD027015	34671372	The Major Peanut Allergen Ara h 2 Produced in Nicotiana benthamiana Contains Hydroxyprolines and Is a Viable Alternative to the E. Coli Product in Allergy Diagnosis. 	Determination of carry-over contaminations in recombinant major peanut allergen Ara h 2 produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and analysis of proline hydroxylation patterns	Peanut allergens, hydroxyproline	Peanut allergy is a potentially life-threatening disease that is mediated by allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. The major peanut allergen Ara h 2, a 2S albumin seed storage protein, is one of the most dangerous and potent plant allergens. Ara h 2 is posttranslationally modified to harbor four disulfide bridges and three hydroxyprolines. These hydroxyproline residues are required for optimal IgE-binding to the DPYSP(OH)S motifs representing an immunodominant IgE epitope. So far, recombinant Ara h 2 has been produced in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Trichoplusia ni insect cell, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast expression systems, which were all incapable of proline hydroxylation. However, molecular diagnosis of peanut allergy is performed using either natural or E. coli-produced major peanut allergens. As IgE from the majority of patients is directed to Ara h 2, it is of great importance that the recombinant Ara h 2 harbors all of its eukaryotic posttranslational modifications. We produced hydroxyproline-containing and correctly folded Ara h 2 in the endoplasmic reticulum of leaf cells of Nicotiana benthamiana plants, using the plant virus-based magnICON((R)) transient expression system with a yield of 200 mg/kg fresh biomass. To compare prokaryotic with eukaryotic expression methods, Ara h 2 was expressed in E. coli together with the disulfide-bond isomerase DsbC and thus harbored disulfide bridges but no hydroxyprolines. The recombinant allergens from N. benthamiana and E. coli were characterized and compared to the natural Ara h 2 isolated from roasted peanuts. Natural Ara h 2 outperformed both recombinant proteins in IgE-binding and activation of basophils via IgE cross-linking, the latter indicating the potency of the allergen. Interestingly, significantly more efficient IgE cross-linking by the N. benthamiana-produced allergen was observed in comparison to the one induced by the E. coli product. Ara h 2 from N. benthamiana plants displayed a higher similarity to the natural allergen in terms of basophil activation due to the presence of hydroxyproline residues, supporting so far published data on their contribution to the immunodominant IgE epitope. Our study advocates the use of N. benthamiana plants instead of prokaryotic expression hosts for the production of the major peanut allergen Ara h 2.
PXD018762	34672913	Integrated multi-omics reveals common properties underlying stress granule and P-body formation. 	Integrated multi-omics reveals common properties underlying stress granule and P-body formation	P-body purification, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Stress Granule purification	Non-membrane-bound compartments such as P-bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs) play important roles in the regulation of gene expression following environmental stresses. We have systematically and quantitatively determined the protein and mRNA composition of PBs and SGs formed before and after nutrient stress. We find that high molecular weight (HMW) complexes exist prior to glucose depletion that we propose may act as seeds for further condensation of proteins forming mature PBs and SGs. We identify an enrichment of proteins with low complexity and RNA binding domains, as well as long, structured mRNAs that are poorly translated following nutrient stress. Many proteins and mRNAs are shared between PBs and SGs including several multivalent RNA binding proteins that promote condensate interactions during liquid-liquid phase separation. We uncover numerous common protein and RNA components across PBs and SGs that support a complex interaction profile during the maturation of these biological condensates. These interaction networks represent a tuneable response to stress, highlighting previously unrecognized condensate heterogeneity. These studies therefore provide an integrated and quantitative understanding of the dynamic nature of key biological condensates.
PXD022086	34672954	An antibody-based proximity labeling map reveals mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition of antiviral immunity. 	A proximity labeling map of SARS-CoV-2 and human	COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, TuboID, interactome, proximity labelling	The global epidemic caused by the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in the infection of over 200 million people. To extend the knowledge of interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and humans, we systematically investigate the interactome of 29 viral proteins in human cells by using an antibody-based TurboID assay. In total, 1,388 high-confidence human proximal proteins with biotinylated sites are identified. Notably, we find that SARS-CoV-2 manipulates the antiviral and immune responses. We validate that the membrane protein ITGB1 associates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. Moreover, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 proteins inhibit activation of the interferon pathway through the mitochondrial protein mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and the methyltransferase SET domain containing 2, histone lysine methyltransferase (SETD2). We propose 111 potential drugs for the clinical treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and identify three compounds that significantly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2. The proximity labeling map of SARS-CoV-2 and humans provides a resource for elucidating the mechanisms of viral infection and developing drugs for COVID-19 treatment.
PXD024284	34673227	Reduced thrombogenicity of surface-treated Nitinol implants steered by altered protein adsorption. 	Reduced thrombogenicity of surface-treated Nitinol implants steered by altered protein adsorption	Antithrombogenic treatment, cardiovascular devices, hemocompatibility, intrinsic coagulation pathway, platelet adhesion	Blood-contacting medical implants made of Nitinol and other titanium alloys, such as neurovascular flow diverters and peripheral stents, have the disadvantage of being highly thrombogenic. This makes the use of systemic (dual) anti-platelet/anticoagulant therapies inevitable with related risks of device thrombosis, bleeding and other complications. Meeting the urgent clinical demand for a less thrombogenic Nitinol surface, we describe here a simple treatment of standard, commercially available Nitinol that renders its surface ultra-hydrophilic and functionalized with phosphate ions. The efficacy of this treatment was assessed by comparing standard and surface-treated Nitinol disks and braids, equivalent to flow diverters. Static and dynamic (Chandler loop) blood incubation tests showed a drastic reduction of thrombus formation on treated devices. Surface chemistry and proteomic analysis indicated a key role of phosphate and calcium ions in steering blood protein adsorption and avoiding coagulation cascade activation and platelet adhesion. A good endothelialization of the surface confirmed the biocompatibility of the treated surface. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Titanium alloys such as Nitinol are biocompatible and show favorable mechanical properties, which led to their widespread use in medical implants. However, in contact with blood their surface triggers the activation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade, which may result in catastrophic thrombotic events. The presented results showed that a phosphate functionalization of the titanium oxide surface suppresses the activation of both coagulation cascade and platelets, avoiding the subsequent formation of a blood clot. This novel approach has therefore a great potential for mitigating the risks associated to either thrombosis or bleeding complications (due to systemic anticoagulation) in patients with cardiovascular implants.
PXD018305	34673281	Proteogenomics Reveals Perturbed Signaling Networks in Malignant Melanoma Cells Resistant to BRAF Inhibition. 	Analysis of Amino Acid Variants in Malignant Melanoma Cells Resistant to BRAF inhibition	BRAFi Resistance, Cancer, Melanoma, Nucleotide Sequencing, Phosphorylation, Proteogenomics	Analysis of nucleotide variants is a cornerstone of cancer medicine. Although only 2% of the genomic sequence is protein coding, mutations occurring in these regions have the potential to influence protein structure or modification status and may have severe impact on disease aetiology. Proteogenomics enables the analysis of sample-specific nonsynonymous nucleotide variants with regard to their effect at the proteome and phosphoproteome levels. Here, we developed a proof-of-concept proteogenomics workflow and applied it to the malignant melanoma cell line A375. Initially, we studied the resistance to serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) inhibitor (BRAFi) vemurafenib in A375 cells. This allowed identification of several oncogenic nonsynonymous nucleotide variants, including a gain-of-function variant on aurora kinase A (AURKA) at F31I. We also detected significant changes in abundance among (phospho)proteins, which led to reactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway in BRAFi-resistant A375 cells. Upon reconstruction of the multiomic integrated signaling networks, we predicted drug therapies with the potential to disrupt BRAFi resistance mechanism in A375 cells. Notably, we showed that AURKA inhibition is effective and specific against BRAFi-resistant A375 cells. Subsequently, we investigated amino acid variants that interfere with protein posttranslational modification (PTM) status and potentially influence A375 cell signaling irrespective of BRAFi resistance. Mass spectrometry (MS) measurements confirmed variant-driven PTM changes in 12 proteins. Among them was the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) displaying a variant on a known phosphorylation site S(Ph)276L. We confirmed the loss of phosphorylation site by MS and demonstrated the impact of this variant on RUNX1 interactome.
PXD015410	34674377	Proteomic and electron microscopy study of myogenic differentiation of alveolar mucosa multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in three-dimensional culture. 	Proteome profiling of myogenic differentiation of alveolar mucosa multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells revealed an unexpected deviation between 2D monolayer and 3D spheroid model cultures.	autophagy, cytoskeleton, mitochondria, monolayer culture, myogenesis, spheroid culture	Myocyte differentiation is featured by adaptation processes, including mitochondria repopulation and cytoskeleton re-organization. The difference between monolayer and spheroid cultured cells at the proteomic level is uncertain. We cultivated alveolar mucosa multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in spheroids in a myogenic way for the proper conditioning of ECM architecture and cell morphology, which induced spontaneous myogenic differentiation of cells within spheroids. Electron microscopy analysis was used for the morphometry of mitochondria biogenesis, and proteomic was used complementary to unveil events underlying differences between two-dimensional/three-dimensional myoblasts differentiation. The prevalence of elongated mitochondria with an average area of 0.097 mum(2) was attributed to monolayer cells 7 days after the passage. The population of small mitochondria with a round shape and area of 0.049 mum(2) (p < 0.05) was observed in spheroid cells cultured under three-dimensional conditions. Cells in spheroids were quantitatively enriched in proteins of mitochondria biogenesis (DNM1L, IDH2, SSBP1), respiratory chain (ACO2, ATP5I, COX5A), extracellular proteins (COL12A1, COL6A1, COL6A2), and cytoskeleton (MYL6, MYL12B, MYH10). Most of the Rab-related transducers were inhibited in spheroid culture. The proteomic assay demonstrated delicate mechanisms of mitochondria autophagy and repopulation, cytoskeleton assembling, and biogenesis. Differences in the ultrastructure of mitochondria indicate active biogenesis under three-dimensional conditions.
PXD024556	34675284	Proteomic profile of mesothelial exosomes isolated from peritoneal dialysis effluent of children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. 	PROTEOMIC PROFILE OF MESOTHELIAL EXOSOMES ISOLATED FROM PERITONEAL DIALYSIS EFFLUENT OF CHILDREN WITH FOCAL SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS	Peritoneal dialysis (PD) kidney disease (ESKD) peritoneal membrane (PM) glomerular sclerosis (FSGS)	Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the worldwide recognized preferred dialysis treatment for children affected by end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, due to the unphysiological composition of PD fluids, the peritoneal membrane (PM) of these patients may undergo structural and functional alterations, which may cause fibrosis. Several factors may accelerate this process and primary kidney disease may have a causative role. In particular, patients affected by steroid resistant primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a rare glomerular disease leading to nephrotic syndrome and ESKD, seem more prone to develop peritoneal fibrosis. The mechanism causing this predisposition is still unrecognized. To better define this condition, we carried out, for the first time, a new comprehensive comparative proteomic mass spectrometry analysis of mesothelial exosomes from peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) of 6 pediatric patients with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) versus 6 patients affected by other primary renal diseases (No FSGS). Our omic study demonstrated that, despite the high overlap in the protein milieu between the two study groups, machine learning allowed to identify a core list of 40 proteins, with ANXA13 as most promising potential biomarker, to distinguish, in our patient population, peritoneal dialysis effluent exosomes of FSGS from No FSGS patients (with 100% accuracy). Additionally, the Weight Gene Co-expression Network Analysis algorithm identified 17 proteins, with PTP4A1 as the most statistically significant biomarker associated to PD vintage and decreased PM function. Altogether, our data suggest that mesothelial cells of FSGS patients are more prone to activate a pro-fibrotic machinery. The role of the proposed biomarkers in the PM pathology deserves further investigation. Our results need further investigations in a larger population to corroborate these findings and investigate a possible increased risk of PM loss of function or development of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis in FSGS patients, thus to eventually carry out changes in PD treatment and management or implement new solutions.
PXD027817	34676182	Serum KLKB1 as a Potential Prognostic Biomarker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Based on Data-Independent Acquisition and Parallel Reaction Monitoring. 	Study on prognostic biomarkers of HCC based on mass spectrometry	DIA, HCC, PRM	PURPOSE: With the advancement of minimally invasive surgery and catheters for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is becoming more and more inconvenient to get tissues or the tissues gained are insufficient for testing. Screening of blood-derived markers is of great significance for prognosis assessment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data-independent acquisition (DIA) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) were implemented to identify valuable prognostic HCC biomarkers in 48 patients with different prognosis. The potential candidate biomarkers were examined in 205 HCC patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and then validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HCC cohort. RESULTS: DIA screened 86 significantly differentially regulated proteins between patients with poor prognosis and those with good prognosis. Eight proteins from the DIA proteomic analyses were quantified by PRM, and six of them (KLKB1, IGFBP3, SHBG, SAA1, C7, and CD44) presented consistent expression trends between DIA and PRM. Then, the results of ELISA indicated that KLKB1 was abnormally expressed in HCC patients, and the serum level of KLKB1 also exhibited significant changes before and after treatment (P = 0.016). Patients with higher KLKB1 serum levels had significantly superior overall survival (P = 0.035) and progression-free survival (P = 0.027) than those with lower KLKB1 expression. In the TCGA-HCC cohort, Cox regression analysis suggested that KLKB1 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.032) of HCC patients. CONCLUSION: Aberrant expression of KLKB1 was strongly associated with the prognosis of HCC patients. KLKB1 may be used to evaluate the prognosis and guide the treatment for HCC.
PXD028349	34676202	Proteomic and Biological Analysis of the Effects of Metformin Senomorphics on the Mesenchymal Stromal Cells. 	Proteomic and biological analysis of metformin senomorphics effects on the mesenchymal stromal cells	mesenchymal stromal cells, senescence, senolytics, senomorphics	Senotherapeutics are new drugs that can modulate senescence phenomena within tissues and reduce the onset of age-related pathologies. Senotherapeutics are divided into senolytics and senomorphics. The senolytics selectively kill senescent cells, while the senomorphics delay or block the onset of senescence. Metformin has been used to treat diabetes for several decades. Recently, it has been proposed that metformin may have anti-aging properties as it prevents DNA damage and inflammation. We evaluated the senomorphic effect of 6 weeks of therapeutic metformin treatment on the biology of human adipose mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The study was combined with a proteome analysis of changes occurring in MSCs' intracellular and secretome protein composition in order to identify molecular pathways associated with the observed biological phenomena. The metformin reduced the replicative senescence and cell death phenomena associated with prolonged in vitro cultivation. The continuous metformin supplementation delayed and/or reduced the impairment of MSC functions as evidenced by the presence of three specific pathways in metformin-treated samples: 1) the alpha-adrenergic signaling, which contributes to regulation of MSCs physiological secretory activity, 2) the signaling pathway associated with MSCs detoxification activity, and 3) the aspartate degradation pathway for optimal energy production. The senomorphic function of metformin seemed related to its reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity. In metformin-treated samples, the CEBPA, TP53 and USF1 transcription factors appeared to be involved in the regulation of several factors (SOD1, SOD2, CAT, GLRX, GSTP1) blocking ROS.
PXD026107	34676246	Proteomic Insights Into Susceptibility and Resistance to Chronic-Stress-Induced Depression or Anxiety in the Rat Striatum. 	Striatal proteomics of CMS-treated rats	anxiety, chronic stress, depression, striatum	Chronic stress is a key factor for the onset of anxiety and depression disorders. However, the stress-induced common and unique molecular basis of the two psychiatric disorders is not fully known and still needs to be explored. Previously, we employed a chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure to induce a rat model including depression-susceptible (Dep-Sus), anxiety-susceptible (Anx-Sus), and insusceptible (Insus) cohorts. In this work, we continuously analyze the striatal proteomes of the three stressed cohorts by the use of comparative proteomics and bioinformatics approaches. Through isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based analysis, 386 abnormally expressed proteins in total were identified. These deregulated proteins are involved in various biological functions and significant pathways that are potentially connected with resistance and susceptibility to CMS-caused anxious- or depressive-like behaviors and, hence, could act as suggestive protein targets. A further parallel reaction monitoring-based independent investigation shows that alterations in Pak5, Dgkg, Scn4b, Rb1cc1, and Acin1; Ggps1, Fntb, Nudt19, Ufd1, and Ndufab1; and Dnajb12, Hbb2, Ap2s1, Ip6k1, and Stk4 were specifically connected with Dep-Sus, Anx-Sus, or Insus groups, respectively, potentially indicating that identical CMS treatment results in the different changes in the striatal protein regulations. Overall, our current proteomics study of the striatum provides an important molecular foundation and comprehensive insights into common and specific deregulations correlated with pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie resistance and susceptibility to chronic stress-induced anxiety or depression.
PXD027254	34677127	Short-chain fatty acids activate acetyltransferase p300. 	Data for: Short-chain fatty acids activate acetyltransferase p300/CBP	metabolomics, p300/CBP, short-chain fatty acids	Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate, and butyrate are produced in large quantities by the gut microbiome and contribute to a wide array of physiological processes. While the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, many effects of SCFAs have been traced to changes in the cell's epigenetic state. Here, we systematically investigate how SCFAs alter the epigenome. Using quantitative proteomics of histone modification states, we identified rapid and sustained increases in histone acetylation after the addition of butyrate or propionate, but not acetate. While decades of prior observations would suggest that hyperacetylation induced by SCFAs are due to inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), we found that propionate and butyrate instead activate the acetyltransferase p300. Propionate and butyrate are rapidly converted to the corresponding acyl-CoAs which are then used by p300 to catalyze auto-acylation of the autoinhibitory loop, activating the enzyme for histone/protein acetylation. This data challenges the long-held belief that SCFAs mainly regulate chromatin by inhibiting HDACs, and instead reveals a previously unknown mechanism of HAT activation that can explain how an influx of low levels of SCFAs alters global chromatin states.
PXD028284	34678314	Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) binds and stabilizes cytochromes P450 through a heme-independent mechanism. 	LC-MSMS with isobaric tagging on Flag-coimmunoprecipitation eluates from Flag-Pgrmc1 and Y113F Flag-Pgrmc1 expressing Pgrmc1 KO mouse liver membranes	Flag-Pgrmc1, Liver, Membrane, Pgrmc1, TMT, Y113F Flag-Pgrmc1, bound, co-immunoprecipitation, eluate, isobaric tag	Progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) is a heme-binding protein implicated in a wide range of cellular functions. We previously showed that PGRMC1 binds to cytochromes P450 in yeast and mammalian cells and supports their activity. Recently, the paralog PGRMC2 was shown to function as a heme chaperone. The extent of PGRMC1 function in cytochrome P450 biology and whether PGRMC1 is also a heme chaperone are unknown. Here, we examined the function of Pgrmc1 in mouse liver using a knockout model and found that Pgrmc1 binds and stabilizes a broad range of cytochromes P450 in a heme-independent manner. Proteomic and transcriptomic studies demonstrated that Pgrmc1 binds more than 13 cytochromes P450 and supports maintenance of cytochrome P450 protein levels posttranscriptionally. In vitro assays confirmed that Pgrmc1 KO livers exhibit reduced cytochrome P450 activity consistent with reduced enzyme levels. Mechanistic studies in cultured cells demonstrated that PGRMC1 stabilizes cytochromes P450 and that binding and stabilization do not require PGRMC1 binding to heme. Importantly, Pgrmc1-dependent stabilization of cytochromes P450 is physiologically relevant, as Pgrmc1 deletion protected mice from acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Finally, evaluation of Y113F mutant Pgrmc1, which lacks the axial heme iron-coordinating hydroxyl group, revealed that proper iron coordination is not required for heme binding, but is required for binding to ferrochelatase, the final enzyme in heme biosynthesis. PGRMC1 was recently identified as the causative mutation in X-linked isolated pediatric cataract formation. Together, these results demonstrate a heme-independent function for PGRMC1 in cytochrome P450 stability that may underlie clinical phenotypes.
PXD022358	34678513	Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomal miR-34c-5p ameliorates RIF by inhibiting the core fucosylation of multiple proteins. 	Mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomal microRNA-34c-5p ameliorates renal pericyte activation by inhibiting core fucosylation	core fucosylation, exosomes, mesenchymal stem cells, microRNA-34c-5p, pericyte, renal interstitial fibrosis	Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) is an incurable pathological lesion in chronic kidney diseases. Pericyte activation is the major pathological characteristic of RIF. Fibroblast and macrophage activation are also involved in RIF. Studies have revealed that core fucosylation (CF), an important post-translational modification of proteins, plays a key role in pericyte activation and RIF by regulating multiple profibrotic signaling pathways as a hub-like target. Here, we reveal that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes reside specifically in the injured kidney and deliver microRNA (miR)-34c-5p to reduce cellular activation and RIF by inhibiting CF. Furthermore, we showed that the CD81-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand-receptor complex aids the entry of exosomal miR-34c-5p into pericytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Altogether, our findings reveal a novel role of MSC-derived exosomes in inhibiting multicellular activation via CF and provide a potential intervention strategy for renal fibrosis.
PXD021960	34680366	Identification of Biochemical and Molecular Markers of Early Aging in Childhood Cancer Survivors. 	IDENTIFICATION OF BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR MARKERS OF EARLY AGING AND CELLULAR STRESS IN CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORS (CCS) PATIENTS	aerobic metabolism, early aging, metabolism modulation, mitochondria biogenesis	Survival rates of childhood cancer patients have improved over the past four decades, although cancer treatments increase the risk of developing chronic diseases typical of aging. Thus, we aimed to identify molecular/metabolic cellular alterations responsible for early aging in childhood cancer survivors (CCS). Biochemical, proteomic, and molecular biology analyses were conducted on mononuclear cells (MNCs) isolated from peripheral blood of 196 CCS, the results being compared with those obtained on MNCs of 154 healthy subjects. CCS-MNCs showed inefficient oxidative phosphorylation associated with low energy status, and increased lipid peroxidation and lactate fermentation compared with age-matched normal controls. According to a mathematical model based on biochemical parameters, CCS-MNCs showed significantly higher metabolic ages than their real ages. The dysfunctional metabolism of CCS-MNCs is associated with lower expression levels of genes and proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism regulation, such as CLUH, PGC1-alpha, and SIRT6 in CCS, not observed in the age-matched healthy or elderly subjects. In conclusion, our study identified some biochemical and molecular alterations possibly contributing to the pathophysiology of aging and metabolic deficiencies in CCS. These results identify new targets for pharmacological interventions to restore mitochondrial function, slowing down the aging-associated pathologies in CCS.
PXD022978	34680548	LRP-1 Matricellular Receptor Involvement in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Tumor Angiogenesis. 	Influence of LRP-1 on MDA-MB-231 secretome	Breast Cancer, LRP-1, MDA-MB-231	BACKGROUND: LRP-1 is a multifunctional scavenger receptor belonging to the LDLR family. Due to its capacity to control pericellular levels of various growth factors and proteases, LRP-1 plays a crucial role in membrane proteome dynamics, which appears decisive for tumor progression. METHODS: LRP-1 involvement in a TNBC model was assessed using an RNA interference strategy in MDA-MB-231 cells. In vivo, tumorigenic and angiogenic effects of LRP-1-repressed cells were evaluated using an orthotopic xenograft model and two angiogenic assays (Matrigel((R)) plugs, CAM). DCE-MRI, FMT, and IHC were used to complete a tumor longitudinal follow-up and obtain morphological and functional vascular information. In vitro, HUVECs' angiogenic potential was evaluated using a tumor secretome, subjected to a proteomic analysis to highlight LRP-1-dependant signaling pathways. RESULTS: LRP-1 repression in MDA-MB-231 tumors led to a 60% growth delay because of, inter alia, morphological and functional vascular differences, confirmed by angiogenic models. In vitro, the LRP-1-repressed cells secretome restrained HUVECs' angiogenic capabilities. A proteomics analysis revealed that LRP-1 supports tumor growth and angiogenesis by regulating TGF-beta signaling and plasminogen/plasmin system. CONCLUSIONS: LRP-1, by its wide spectrum of interactions, emerges as an important matricellular player in the control of cancer-signaling events such as angiogenesis, by supporting tumor vascular morphology and functionality.
PXD026801	34681148	Pomacea canaliculata Ampullar Proteome: A Nematode-Based Bio-Pesticide Induces Changes in Metabolic and Stress-Related Pathways. 	Pomacea canaliculata ampullar proteome: a nematode-based bio-pesticide induces changes in metabolic and stress-related pathways	Amupulla, Biopesticide, Pomacea canaliculata, QExactive	Pomacea canaliculata is a freshwater gastropod known for being both a highly invasive species and one of the possible intermediate hosts of the mammalian parasite Angiostrongylus cantonensis. With the aim of providing new information concerning P. canaliculata biology and adaptability, the first proteome of the ampulla, i.e., a small organ associated with the circulatory system and known as a reservoir of nitrogen-containing compounds, was obtained. The ampullar proteome was derived from ampullae of control snails or after exposure to a nematode-based molluscicide, known for killing snails in a dose- and temperature-dependent fashion. Proteome analysis revealed that the composition of connective ampulla walls, cell metabolism and oxidative stress response were affected by the bio-pesticide. Ultrastructural investigations have highlighted the presence of rhogocytes within the ampullar walls, as it has been reported for other organs containing nitrogen storage tissue. Collected data suggested that the ampulla may belong to a network of organs involved in controlling and facing oxidative stress in different situations. The response against the nematode-based molluscicide recalled the response set up during early arousal after aestivation and hibernation, thus encouraging the hypothesis that metabolic pathways and antioxidant defences promoting amphibiousness could also prove useful in facing other challenges stimulating an oxidative stress response, e.g., immune challenges or biocide exposure. Targeting the oxidative stress resistance of P. canaliculata may prove helpful for increasing its susceptibility to bio-pesticides and may help the sustainable control of this pest's diffusion.
PXD028267	34681663	Proteomic Landscape of Extracellular Vesicles for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Subtyping. 	Human Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines	cancer, diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines, extra cellular vesicles	The role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) proteome in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) pathology, subclassification, and patient screening is unexplored. We analyzed by state-of-the-art mass spectrometry the whole cell and secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) proteomes of different molecular subtypes of DLBCL, germinal center B cell (GCB subtype), and activated B cell (ABC subtype). After quality control assessment, we compared whole-cell and secreted EVs proteomes of the two cell-of-origin (COO) categories, GCB and ABC subtypes, resulting in 288/1115 significantly differential expressed proteins from the whole-cell proteome and 228/608 proteins from EVs (adjust p-value < 0.05/p-value < 0.05). In our preclinical model system, we demonstrated that the EV proteome and the whole-cell proteome possess the capacity to separate cell lines into ABC and GCB subtypes. KEGG functional analysis and GO enrichment analysis for cellular component, molecular function, and biological process of differential expressed proteins (DEP) between ABC and GCB EVs showed a significant enrichment of pathways involved in immune response function. Other enriched functional categories for DEPs constitute cellular signaling and intracellular trafficking such as B-cell receptor (BCR), Fc_gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, ErbB signaling, and endocytosis. Our results suggest EVs can be explored as a tool for patient diagnosis, follow-up, and disease monitoring. Finally, this study proposes novel drug targets based on highly expressed proteins, for which antitumor drugs are available suggesting potential combinatorial therapies for aggressive forms of DLBCL. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD028267.
PXD029015	34681804	Human Serum Extracellular Vesicle Proteomic Profile Depends on the Enrichment Method Employed. 	Human serum extracellular vesicle proteomic profile depends on the enrichment method employed	extracellular vesicles, precipitation kits, serum, size exclusion, ultracentrifugation	The proteomic profiling of serum samples supposes a challenge due to the large abundance of a few blood proteins in comparison with other circulating proteins coming from different tissues and cells. Although the sensitivity of protein detection has increased enormously in the last years, specific strategies are still required to enrich less abundant proteins and get rid of abundant proteins such as albumin, lipoproteins, and immunoglobulins. One of the alternatives that has become more promising is to characterize circulating extracellular vesicles from serum samples that have great interest in biomedicine. In the present work, we enriched the extracellular vesicles fraction from human serum by applying different techniques, including ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion chromatography, and two commercial precipitation methods based on different mechanisms of action. To improve the performance and efficacy of the techniques to promote purity of the preparations, we have employed a small volume of serum samples (<100 mL). The comparative proteomic profiling of the enriched preparations shows that ultracentrifugation procedure yielded a larger and completely different set of proteins than other techniques, including mitochondrial and ribosome related proteins. The results showed that size exclusion chromatography carries over lipoprotein associated proteins, while a polymer-based precipitation kit has more affinity for proteins associated with granules of platelets. The precipitation kit that targets glycosylation molecules enriches differentially protein harboring glycosylation sites, including immunoglobulins and proteins of the membrane attack complex.
PXD031203	34681888	Dynamics of Germinosome Formation and FRET-Based Analysis of Interactions between GerD and Germinant Receptor Subunits in Bacillus cereus Spores. 	Dynamics of Germinosome Formation Interactions between GerD and Germinant Receptor Subunits in Bacillus cereus Spores	Bacillus cereus, PASEF, Spores, iBAQ	Spores of the bacterium Bacillus cereus can cause disease in humans due to contamination of raw materials for food manufacturing. These dormant, resistant spores can survive for years in the environment, but can germinate and grow when their surroundings become suitable, and spore germination proteins play an important role in the decision to germinate. Since germinated spores have lost dormant spores' extreme resistance, knowledge about the formation and function of germination proteins could be useful in suggesting new preservation strategies to control B. cereus spores. In this study, we confirmed that the GerR germinant receptor's (GR) A, B, and C subunits and GerD co-localize in B. cereus spore inner membrane (IM) foci termed germinosomes. The interaction between these proteins was examined by using fusions to the fluorescent reporter proteins SGFP2 and mScarlet-I and Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). This work found that the FRET efficiency was 6% between GerR(A-C-B)-SGFP2 and GerD-mScarlet-I, but there was no FRET between GerD-mScarlet-I and either GerRA-SGFP2 or GerRC-SGFP2. These results and that GerD does not interact with a GR C-subunit in vitro suggest that, in the germinosome, GerD interacts primarily with the GR B subunit. The dynamics of formation of germinosomes with GerR(A-C-B)-SGFP2 and GerD-mScarlet-I was also followed during sporulation. Our results showed heterogeneity in the formation of FRET positive foci of GerR(A-C-B)-SGFP2 and GerD-mScarlet-I; and while some foci formed at the same time, the formation of foci in the FRET channel could be significantly delayed. The latter finding suggests that either the GerR GR can at least transiently form IM foci in the absence of GerD, or that, while GerD is essential for GerR foci formation, the time to attain the final germinosome structure with close contacts between GerD and GerR can be heterogeneous.
PXD028099	34685588	A Human 3D Cardiomyocyte Risk Model to Study the Cardiotoxic Influence of X-rays and Other Noxae in Adults. 	Proteomics to study cardiotoxic noxae in adults	cardiomyocytes, ionizing radiation, maturation	The heart tissue is a potential target of various noxae contributing to the onset of cardiovascular diseases. However, underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. Human stem cell-derived models are promising, but a major concern is cell immaturity when estimating risks for adults. In this study, 3D aggregates of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were cultivated for 300 days and characterized regarding degree of maturity, structure, and cell composition. Furthermore, effects of ionizing radiation (X-rays, 0.1-2 Gy) on matured aggregates were investigated, representing one of the noxae that are challenging to assess. Video-based functional analyses were correlated to changes in the proteome after irradiation. Cardiomyocytes reached maximum maturity after 100 days in cultivation, judged by alpha-actinin lengths, and displayed typical multinucleation and branching. At this time, aggregates contained all major cardiac cell types, proven by the patch-clamp technique. Matured and X-ray-irradiated aggregates revealed a subtle increase in beat rates and a more arrhythmic sequence of cellular depolarisation and repolarisation compared to non-irradiated sham controls. The proteome analysis provides first insights into signaling mechanisms contributing to cardiotoxicity. Here, we propose an in vitro model suitable to screen various noxae to target adult cardiotoxicity by preserving all the benefits of a 3D tissue culture.
PXD027888	34685602	Proteomic Analysis of Exosomes during Cardiogenic Differentiation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells. 	Analysis of exosomes secreted during cardiac differentiation	Exosome, LCMS, ProteomeXchange project tag: Human Proteome Project, cardiac differentiation, human pluripotent stem cells	Efforts to direct the specification of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to therapeutically important somatic cell types have focused on identifying proper combinations of soluble cues. Yet, whether exosomes, which mediate intercellular communication, play a role in the differentiation remains unexplored. We took a first step toward addressing this question by subjecting hPSCs to stage-wise specification toward cardiomyocytes (CMs) in scalable stirred-suspension cultures and collecting exosomes. Samples underwent liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS) and subsequent proteomic analysis revealed over 300 unique proteins from four differentiation stages including proteins such as PPP2CA, AFM, MYH9, MYH10, TRA2B, CTNNA1, EHD1, ACTC1, LDHB, and GPC4, which are linked to cardiogenic commitment. There was a significant correlation of the protein composition of exosomes with the hPSC line and stage of commitment. Differentiating hPSCs treated with exosomes from hPSC-derived CMs displayed improved efficiency of CM formation compared to cells without exogenously added vesicles. Collectively, these results demonstrate that exosomes from hPSCs induced along the CM lineage contain proteins linked to the specification process with modulating effects and open avenues for enhancing the biomanufacturing of stem cell products for cardiac diseases.
PXD028505	34686148	A SISCAPA-based approach for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens from clinical samples. 	A SISCAPA-based approach for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens from clinical samples.	COVID-19, Covid-19, Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, SARS-CoV-2, SISCAPA	SARS-CoV-2, a novel human coronavirus, has created a global disease burden infecting > 100 million humans in just over a year. RT-PCR is currently the predominant method of diagnosing this viral infection although a variety of tests to detect viral antigens have also been developed. In this study, we adopted a SISCAPA-based enrichment approach using anti-peptide antibodies generated against peptides from the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. We developed a targeted workflow in which nasopharyngeal swab samples were digested followed by enrichment of viral peptides using the anti-peptide antibodies and targeted parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis using a high-resolution mass spectrometer. This workflow was applied to 41 RT-PCR-confirmed clinical SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples and 30 negative samples. The workflow employed was highly specific as none of the target peptides were detected in negative samples. Further, the detected peptides showed a positive correlation with the viral loads as measured by RT-PCR Ct values. The SISCAPA-based platform described in the current study can serve as an alternative method for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and can also be applied for detecting other microbial pathogens directly from clinical samples.
PXD022593	34687499	An endoparasitoid uses its egg surface proteins to regulate its host immune response. 	An endoparasitoid uses its egg surface proteins to regulate the host immune response	Chilo suppressalis, Cotesia chilonis, larvae	With proteomic analysis, we identified 379 egg surface proteins from an endoparasitoid, Cotesia chilonis. Proteins containing conserved enzymatic domains constitute a large proportion of egg surface components. Some proteins, such as superoxidase dismutase, homolog of C. rubecula 32-kDa protein, and immunoevasive protein-2A, are classical parasitism factors that have known functions in host immunity regulation. Melanization assays revealed that a novel egg surface protein, C. chilonis egg surface serpin domain-containing protein had the same function as a C. chilonis venom serpin, as both suppressed host melanization in a dose-dependent manner. C. chilonis egg surface serpin domain-containing protein is mainly transcribed in C. chilonis oocytes with follicular cells, and it is located on both the anterior and posterior sides of the mature egg surface. Additionally, we used LC-MS/MS to identify 586 binding proteins sourced from C. suppressalis plasma located on the eggshell surface of C. chilonis, which included some immunity-related proteins. These results not only indicate that C. chilonis uses its egg surface proteins to reduce the immune response of its host but also imply that endoparasitoid egg surface proteins might be a new parasitism factor involved in host immune regulation.
PXD024884	34687543	Standardized Workflow for Precise Mid- and High-Throughput Proteomics of Blood Biofluids. 	Standardized workflow for precise mid- and high-throughput proteomics of blood biofluids	automation, blood, clinical proteomics, data independent acquisition, plasma	BACKGROUND: Accurate discovery assay workflows are critical for identifying authentic circulating protein biomarkers in diverse blood matrices. Maximizing the commonalities in the proteomic workflows between different biofluids simplifies the approach and increases the likelihood for reproducibility. We developed a workflow that can accommodate 3 blood-based proteomes: naive plasma, depleted plasma and dried blood. METHODS: Optimal conditions for sample preparation and data independent acquisition-mass spectrometry analysis were established in plasma then automated for depleted plasma and dried blood. The mass spectrometry workflow was modified to facilitate sensitive high-throughput analysis or deeper profiling with mid-throughput analysis. Analytical performance was evaluated by the linear response of peptides and proteins to a 6- or 7-point dilution curve and the reproducibility of the relative peptide and protein intensity for 5 digestion replicates per day on 3 different days for each biofluid. RESULTS: Using the high-throughput workflow, 74% (plasma), 93% (depleted), and 87% (dried blood) displayed an inter-day CV <30%. The mid-throughput workflow had 67% (plasma), 90% (depleted), and 78% (dried blood) of peptides display an inter-day CV <30%. Lower limits of detection and quantification were determined for peptides and proteins observed in each biofluid and workflow. Based on each protein and peptide's analytical performance, we could describe the observable, reliable, reproducible, and quantifiable proteomes for each biofluid and workflow. CONCLUSION: The standardized workflows established here allows for reproducible and quantifiable detection of proteins covering a broad dynamic range. We envisage that implementation of this standard workflow should simplify discovery approaches and facilitate the translation of candidate markers into clinical use.
PXD027724	34687701	Post-translational regulation and proteolytic activity of the metalloproteinase ADAMTS8. 	Post-translational regulation and proteolytic activity of human adamts-8: a comparison with adamts-1, -4, and -5	ADAMTS, ECM, OPN, PAH, protease	A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin type 1 motifs (ADAMTS)8 is a secreted protease, which was recently implicated in pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, the substrate repertoire of ADAMTS8 and regulation of its activity are incompletely understood. Although considered a proteoglycanase because of high sequence similarity and close phylogenetic relationship to the proteoglycan-degrading proteases ADAMTS1, 4, 5, and 15, as well as tight genetic linkage with ADAMTS15 on human chromosome 11, its aggrecanase activity was reportedly weak. Several post-translational factors are known to regulate ADAMTS proteases such as autolysis, inhibition by endogenous inhibitors, and receptor-mediated endocytosis, but their impacts on ADAMTS8 are unknown. Here, we show that ADAMTS8 undergoes autolysis at six different sites within its spacer domain. We also found that in contrast to ADAMTS4 and 5, ADAMTS8 levels were not regulated through low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)-mediated endocytosis. Additionally, ADAMTS8 lacked significant activity against the proteoglycans aggrecan, versican, and biglycan. Instead, we found that ADAMTS8 cleaved osteopontin, a phosphoprotein whose expression is upregulated in PAH. Multiple ADAMTS8 cleavage sites were identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Osteopontin cleavage by ADAMTS8 was efficiently inhibited by TIMP-3, an endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS1, 4, and 5, as well as by TIMP-2, which has no previously reported inhibitory activity against other ADAMTS proteases. These differences in post-translational regulation and substrate repertoire differentiate ADAMTS8 from other family members and may help to elucidate its role in PAH.
PXD029371	34687897	Physiological properties, composition and structural profiling of porcine gastrointestinal mucus. 	Label-free and targeted mass tandem (TMT-labelled) global proteomic analyses on mucus from the stomach, small and large intestine of pigLabel-free and targeted mass tandem (TMT-labelled) global proteomic analyses on mucus from the stomach, small and large	composition, gastrointestinal, healthy, mucus, pig, porcine	The gastrointestinal mucus is a hydrogel that lines the luminal side of the gastrointestinal epithelium, offering barrier protection from pathogens and lubrication of the intraluminal contents. These barrier properties likewise affect nutrients and drugs that need to penetrate the mucus to reach the epithelium prior to absorption. In order to assess the potential impact of the mucus on drug absorption, we need information about the nature of the gastrointestinal mucus. Today, most of the relevant available literature is mainly derived from rodent studies. In this work, we used a larger animal species, the pig model, to characterize the mucus throughout the length of the gastrointestinal tract. This is the first report of the physiological properties (physical appearance, pH and water content), composition (protein, lipid and metabolite content) and structural profiling (rheology and gel network) of the porcine gastrointestinal mucus. These findings allow for direct comparisons between the characteristics of mucus from various segments and can be further utilized to improve our understanding of the role of the mucus on region dependent drug absorption. Additionally, the present work is expected to contribute to the assessment of the porcine model as a preclinical species in the drug development process.
PXD028005	34688652	Flexible open conformation of the AP-3 complex explains its role in cargo recruitment at the Golgi. 	Conformation of the AP-3 complex explains its role in cargo recruitment at the Golgi	AP-3, crosslinking, structure	Vesicle formation at endomembranes requires the selective concentration of cargo by coat proteins. Conserved adapter protein complexes at the Golgi (AP-3), the endosome (AP-1), or the plasma membrane (AP-2) with their conserved core domain and flexible ear domains mediate this function. These complexes also rely on the small GTPase Arf1 and/or specific phosphoinositides for membrane binding. The structural details that influence these processes, however, are still poorly understood. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the full-length stable 300 kDa yeast AP-3 complex. The structures reveal that AP-3 adopts an open conformation in solution, comparable to the membrane-bound conformations of AP-1 or AP-2. This open conformation appears to be far more flexible than AP-1 or AP-2, resulting in compact, intermediate, and stretched subconformations. Mass spectrometrical analysis of the cross-linked AP-3 complex further indicates that the ear domains are flexibly attached to the surface of the complex. Using biochemical reconstitution assays, we also show that efficient AP-3 recruitment to the membrane depends primarily on cargo binding. Once bound to cargo, AP-3 clustered and immobilized cargo molecules, as revealed by single-molecule imaging on polymer-supported membranes. We conclude that its flexible open state may enable AP-3 to bind and collect cargo at the Golgi and could thus allow coordinated vesicle formation at the trans-Golgi upon Arf1 activation.
PXD025819	34688654	The KRAS-regulated kinome identifies WEE1 and ERK coinhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy in KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer. 	Determining the KRAS-regulated kinome in PDAC	KRAS, MIB, PDAC, cell line, pancreatic cancer	Oncogenic KRAS drives cancer growth by activating diverse signaling networks, not all of which have been fully delineated. We set out to establish a system-wide profile of the KRAS-regulated kinase signaling network (kinome) in KRAS-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We knocked down KRAS expression in a panel of six cell lines and then applied multiplexed inhibitor bead/MS to monitor changes in kinase activity and/or expression. We hypothesized that depletion of KRAS would result in downregulation of kinases required for KRAS-mediated transformation and in upregulation of other kinases that could potentially compensate for the deleterious consequences of the loss of KRAS. We identified 15 upregulated and 13 downregulated kinases in common across the panel of cell lines. In agreement with our hypothesis, all 15 of the upregulated kinases have established roles as cancer drivers (e.g., SRC, TGF-beta1, ILK), and pharmacological inhibition of one of these upregulated kinases, DDR1, suppressed PDAC growth. Interestingly, 11 of the 13 downregulated kinases have established driver roles in cell cycle progression, particularly in mitosis (e.g., WEE1, Aurora A, PLK1). Consistent with a crucial role for the downregulated kinases in promoting KRAS-driven proliferation, we found that pharmacological inhibition of WEE1 also suppressed PDAC growth. The unexpected paradoxical activation of ERK upon WEE1 inhibition led us to inhibit both WEE1 and ERK concurrently, which caused further potent growth suppression and enhanced apoptotic death compared with WEE1 inhibition alone. We conclude that system-wide delineation of the KRAS-regulated kinome can identify potential therapeutic targets for KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer.
PXD028851	34688666	Identification of a substrate-like cleavage-resistant thrombin inhibitor from the saliva of the flea Xenopsylla cheopis. 	A substrate-like thrombin inhibitor from the saliva of the flea Xenopsylla cheopis is resistant to cleavage by the enzyme	Blood feeding, X-ray crystallography, flea, thrombin	The salivary glands of the flea Xenopsylla cheopis, a vector of the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, express proteins and peptides thought to target the hemostatic and inflammatory systems of its mammalian hosts. Past transcriptomic analyses of salivary gland tissue revealed the presence of two similar peptides (XC-42 and XC-43) having no extensive similarities to any other deposited sequences. Here we show that these peptides specifically inhibit coagulation of plasma and the amidolytic activity of alpha-thrombin. XC-43, the smaller of the two peptides, is a fast, tight-binding inhibitor of thrombin with a dissociation constant of less than 10 pM. XC-42 exhibits similar selectivity as well as kinetic and binding properties. The crystal structure of XC-43 in complex with thrombin shows that despite its substrate-like binding mode, XC-43 is not detectably cleaved by thrombin and that it interacts with the thrombin surface from the enzyme catalytic site through the fibrinogen-binding exosite I. The low rate of hydrolysis was verified in solution experiments with XC-43, which show the substrate to be largely intact after 2 h of incubation with thrombin at 37 degreesC. The low rate of XC-43 cleavage by thrombin may be attributable to specific changes in the catalytic triad observable in the crystal structure of the complex or to extensive interactions in the prime sites that may stabilize the binding of cleavage products. Based on the increased arterial occlusion time, tail bleeding time, and blood coagulation parameters in rat models of thrombosis XC-43 could be valuable as an anticoagulant.
PXD024033	34688688	Cell Wall Stress Stimulates the Activity of the Protein Kinase StkP of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Leading to Multiple Phosphorylation. 	Targets of kinase/phosphatase signalling pair StkP/PhpP in S. pneumoniae and their involvement in response to cell wall stress	Ser/Thr protein kinase StkP, Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin treatment, cell wall stress, phosphatase PhpP, phosphoproteome, signalling	Streptococcus pneumoniae is an opportunistic human pathogen that encodes a single eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr protein kinase StkP and its functional counterpart, the protein phosphatase PhpP. These signaling enzymes play critical roles in coordinating cell division and growth in pneumococci. In this study, we determined the proteome and phosphoproteome profiles of relevant mutants. Comparison of those with the wild-type provided a representative dataset of novel phosphoacceptor sites and StkP-dependent substrates. StkP phosphorylates key proteins involved in cell division and cell wall biosynthesis in both the unencapsulated laboratory strain Rx1 and the encapsulated virulent strain D39. Furthermore, we show that StkP plays an important role in triggering an adaptive response induced by a cell wall-directed antibiotic. Phosphorylation of the sensor histidine kinase WalK and downregulation of proteins of the WalRK core regulon suggest crosstalk between StkP and the WalRK two-component system. Analysis of proteomic profiles led to the identification of gene clusters regulated by catabolite control mechanisms, indicating a tight coupling of carbon metabolism and cell wall homeostasis. The imbalance of steady-state protein phosphorylation in the mutants as well as after antibiotic treatment is accompanied by an accumulation of the global Spx regulator, indicating a Spx-mediated envelope stress response. In summary, StkP relays the perceived signal of cell wall status to key cell division and regulatory proteins, controlling the cell cycle and cell wall homeostasis.
PXD025313	34689152	Quantitative analysis of phosphoproteome in necroptosis reveals a role of TRIM28 phosphorylation in promoting necroptosis-induced cytokine production. 	Quantitative analysis of phosphoproteome in necroptosis	RIPK1, necroptosis, phosphoproteome	Necroptosis is a form of regulated necrotic cell death that promotes inflammation. In cells undergoing necroptosis, activated RIPK1 kinase mediates the formation of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL complex to promote MLKL oligomerization and execution of necroptosis. RIPK1 kinase activity also promotes cell-autonomous activation of proinflammatory cytokine production in necroptosis. However, the signaling pathways downstream of RIPK1 kinase in necroptosis and how RIPK1 kinase activation controls inflammatory response induced by necroptosis are still largely unknown. Here, we quantitatively measured the temporal dynamics of over 7000 confident phosphorylation-sites during necroptosis using mass spectrometry. Our study defined a RIPK1-dependent phosphorylation pattern in late necroptosis that is associated with a proinflammatory component marked by p-S473 TRIM28. We show that the activation of p38 MAPK mediated by oligomerized MLKL promotes the phosphorylation of S473 TRIM28, which in turn mediates inflammation during late necroptosis. Taken together, our study illustrates a mechanism by which p38 MAPK may be activated by oligomerized MLKL to promote inflammation in necroptosis.
PXD025996	34689785	MYCN and MAX alterations in Wilms tumor and identification of novel N-MYC interaction partners as biomarker candidates. 	MYCN and MAX alterations in Wilms tumor and identification of novel interactors as biomarker candidates	N-MYC, Wilms tumour, kidney, pediatric cancer, prognostic marker	BACKGROUND: Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common renal tumor in childhood. Among others, MYCN copy number gain and MYCN P44L and MAX R60Q mutations have been identified in WT. MYCN encodes a transcription factor that requires dimerization with MAX to activate transcription of numerous target genes. MYCN gain has been associated with adverse prognosis in different childhood tumors including WT. The MYCN P44L and MAX R60Q mutations, located in either the transactivating or basic helix-loop-helix domain, respectively, are predicted to be damaging by different pathogenicity prediction tools, but the functional consequences remain to be characterized. METHODS: We screened a large cohort of unselected WTs for MYCN and MAX alterations. Wild-type and mutant protein function were characterized biochemically, and we analyzed the N-MYC protein interactome by mass spectrometric analysis of N-MYC containing protein complexes. RESULTS: Mutation screening revealed mutation frequencies of 3% for MYCN P44L and 0.9% for MAX R60Q that are associated with a higher risk of relapse. Biochemical characterization identified a reduced transcriptional activation potential for MAX R60Q, while the MYCN P44L mutation did not change activation potential or protein stability. The protein interactome of N-MYC-P44L was likewise not altered as shown by mass spectrometric analyses of purified N-MYC complexes. Nevertheless, we could identify a number of novel N-MYC partner proteins, e.g. PEG10, YEATS2, FOXK1, CBLL1 and MCRS1, whose expression is correlated with MYCN in WT samples and several of these are known for their own oncogenic potential. CONCLUSIONS: The strongly elevated risk of relapse associated with mutant MYCN and MAX or elevated MYCN expression corroborates their role in WT oncogenesis. Together with the newly identified co-expressed interactors they expand the range of potential biomarkers for WT stratification and targeting, especially for high-risk WT.
PXD028140	34691115	RabA2b Overexpression Alters the Plasma-Membrane Proteome and Improves Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis. 	RabA2b overexpression alters the Plasma-Membrane Proteome and Improves Drought Tolerance in Arabidopsis	Drought, Plasma-Membrane	Rab proteins are small GTPases that are important in the regulation of vesicle trafficking. Through data mining, we identified RabA2b to be stress responsive, though little is known about the involvement of RabA in plant responses to abiotic stresses. Analysis of the RabA2b native promoter showed strong activity during osmotic stress, which required the stress hormone Abscisic acid (ABA) and was restricted to the vasculature. Sequence analysis of the promoter region identified predicted binding motifs for several ABA-responsive transcription factors. We cloned RabA2b and overexpressed it in Arabidopsis. The resulting transgenic plants were strikingly drought resistant. The reduced water loss observed in detached leaves of the transgenic plants could not be explained by stomatal aperture or density, which was similar in all the genotypes. Subcellular localization studies detected strong colocalization between RabA2b and the plasma membrane (PM) marker PIP2. Further studies of the PM showed, for the first time, a distinguished alteration in the PM proteome as a result of RabA2b overexpression. Proteomic analysis of isolated PM fractions showed enrichment of stress-coping proteins as well as cell wall/cuticle modifiers in the transgenic lines. Finally, the cuticle permeability of transgenic leaves was significantly reduced compared to the wild type, suggesting that it plays a role in its drought resistant properties. Overall, these data provide new insights into the roles and modes of action of RabA2b during water stresses, and indicate that increased RabA2b mediated PM trafficking can affect the PM proteome and increase drought tolerance.
PXD026228	34692671	Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 Alleviates DSS-Induced Ulcerative Colitis Through Activating Intestinal Stem Cell by Target ID3. 	Colon LC-MSMS of Mouse with experimental colitis	colon	Damage to intestinal epithelial cell proliferation or intestinal stem cell (ISC) maintenance may trigger inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and protecting the ISCs is critical for IBD treatment. Here, we found that in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis mice model, colon epithelium and Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells (ISCs) renew quickly during the first 3 days. We also found that during this renewing period, SMAD4 and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) expression were significantly upregulated. An extra BMP4 treatment could preserve the Lgr5(+) ISCs and the colon epithelium turnover, and could significantly decrease colon mucosal damage. Moreover, we found that BMP4 regulated ID3 expression in the colon epithelium. Depletion of ID3 could significantly reduce the epithelium renewal and ratio of Lgr5(+) ISCs at the base of crypts. In conclusion, the present study showed that BMP4 could maintain epithelium cellular proliferation and the ISCs function through ID3 in mice with DSS-induced colitis. The administration of exogenous BMP4 supplement could alleviate DSS-induced colitis by restoring epithelium cellular proliferation and ISC function, suggesting the possible therapeutic function of BMP4 for ulcerative colitis.
PXD028168	34692675	Intracellular Lipid Accumulation and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Accompanies Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Caused by Loss of the Co-chaperone DNAJC3. 	Intracellular lipid accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction accompanies ER-stress caused by loss of the co-chaperone DNAJC3	BiP, Chaperonopathy, cholesterol-stress, neuroproteomics, beta-amyloid	Recessive mutations in DNAJC3, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident BiP co-chaperone, have been identified in patients with multisystemic neurodegeneration and diabetes mellitus. To further unravel these pathomechanisms, we employed a non-biased proteomic approach and identified dysregulation of several key cellular pathways, suggesting a pathophysiological interplay of perturbed lipid metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics, ER-Golgi function, and amyloid-beta processing. Further functional investigations in fibroblasts of patients with DNAJC3 mutations detected cellular accumulation of lipids and an increased sensitivity to cholesterol stress, which led to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), alterations of the ER-Golgi machinery, and a defect of amyloid precursor protein. In line with the results of previous studies, we describe here alterations in mitochondrial morphology and function, as a major contributor to the DNAJC3 pathophysiology. Hence, we propose that the loss of DNAJC3 affects lipid/cholesterol homeostasis, leading to UPR activation, beta-amyloid accumulation, and impairment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
PXD014812	34694888	Sequential Defects in Cardiac Lineage Commitment and Maturation Cause Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome. 	Sequential defects in cardiac lineage commitment and maturation cause hypoplastic left heart syndrome	hypoplastic left heart syndrome	BACKGROUND: Complex molecular programs in specific cell lineages govern human heart development. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is the most common and severe manifestation within the spectrum of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction defects occurring in association with ventricular hypoplasia. The pathogenesis of HLHS is unknown, but hemodynamic disturbances are assumed to play a prominent role. METHODS: To identify perturbations in gene programs controlling ventricular muscle lineage development in HLHS, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 87 HLHS parent-offspring trios, nuclear transcriptomics of cardiomyocytes from ventricles of 4 patients with HLHS and 15 controls at different stages of heart development, single cell RNA sequencing, and 3D modeling in induced pluripotent stem cells from 3 patients with HLHS and 3 controls. RESULTS: Gene set enrichment and protein network analyses of damaging de novo mutations and dysregulated genes from ventricles of patients with HLHS suggested alterations in specific gene programs and cellular processes critical during fetal ventricular cardiogenesis, including cell cycle and cardiomyocyte maturation. Single-cell and 3D modeling with induced pluripotent stem cells demonstrated intrinsic defects in the cell cycle/unfolded protein response/autophagy hub resulting in disrupted differentiation of early cardiac progenitor lineages leading to defective cardiomyocyte subtype differentiation/maturation in HLHS. Premature cell cycle exit of ventricular cardiomyocytes from patients with HLHS prevented normal tissue responses to developmental signals for growth, leading to multinucleation/polyploidy, accumulation of DNA damage, and exacerbated apoptosis, all potential drivers of left ventricular hypoplasia in absence of hemodynamic cues. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight that despite genetic heterogeneity in HLHS, many mutations converge on sequential cellular processes primarily driving cardiac myogenesis, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches.
PXD024308	34695608	Exercise prevents fatty liver by modifying the compensatory response of mitochondrial metabolism to excess substrate availability. 	Exercise prevents substrate overload of liver mitochondria by modification of the compensatory responses during chronic overnutrition	DIA, Exercise, Lipidomics, Mitochondria	OBJECTIVE: Liver mitochondria adapt to high-calorie intake. We investigated how exercise alters the early compensatory response of mitochondria, thus preventing fatty liver disease as a long-term consequence of overnutrition. METHODS: We compared the effects of a steatogenic high-energy diet (HED) for six weeks on mitochondrial metabolism of sedentary and treadmill-trained C57BL/6N mice. We applied multi-OMICs analyses to study the alterations in the proteome, transcriptome, and lipids in isolated mitochondria of liver and skeletal muscle as well as in whole tissue and examined the functional consequences by high-resolution respirometry. RESULTS: HED increased the respiratory capacity of isolated liver mitochondria, both in sedentary and in trained mice. However, proteomics analysis of the mitochondria and transcriptomics indicated that training modified the adaptation of the hepatic metabolism to HED on the level of respiratory complex I, glucose oxidation, pyruvate and acetyl-CoA metabolism, and lipogenesis. Training also counteracted the HED-induced glucose intolerance, the increase in fasting insulin, and in liver fat by lowering diacylglycerol species and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in the livers of trained HED-fed mice, two mechanisms that can reverse hepatic insulin resistance. In skeletal muscle, the combination of HED and training improved the oxidative capacity to a greater extent than training alone by increasing respiration of isolated mitochondria and total mitochondrial protein content. CONCLUSION: We provide a comprehensive insight into the early adaptations of mitochondria in the liver and skeletal muscle to HED and endurance training. Our results suggest that exercise disconnects the HED-induced increase in mitochondrial substrate oxidation from pyruvate and acetyl-CoA-driven lipid synthesis. This could contribute to the prevention of deleterious long-term effects of high fat and sugar intake on hepatic mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity.
PXD028332	34697316	Antibiotic-chemoattractants enhance neutrophil clearance of Staphylococcus aureus. 	Antibiotic-Chemoattractants Enhance Neutrophil Clearance of Staphylococcus aureus	antibiotic, chemotaxis, immunotherapeutic, innate immunity, neutrophil, superbug	The pathogen Staphylococcus aureus can readily develop antibiotic resistance and evade the human immune system, which is associated with reduced levels of neutrophil recruitment. Here, we present a class of antibacterial peptides with potential to act both as antibiotics and as neutrophil chemoattractants. The compounds, which we term 'antibiotic-chemoattractants', consist of a formylated peptide (known to act as chemoattractant for neutrophil recruitment) that is covalently linked to the antibiotic vancomycin (known to bind to the bacterial cell wall). We use a combination of in vitro assays, cellular assays, infection-on-a-chip and in vivo mouse models to show that the compounds improve the recruitment, engulfment and killing of S. aureus by neutrophils. Furthermore, optimizing the formyl peptide sequence can enhance neutrophil activity through differential activation of formyl peptide receptors. Thus, we propose antibiotic-chemoattractants as an alternate approach for antibiotic development.
PXD028582	34699250	Tyrosine phosphorylation of NLRP3 by the Src family kinase Lyn suppresses the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome. 	Tyrosine Phosphorylation of NLRP3 by Src Family Protein Tyrosine Kinase Lyn Suppresses NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation	Lyn tryosine kinase, murine NLRP3 inflammasome	In response to microbes and other danger signals, the NLRP3 inflammasome in immune cells triggers the activation of the protease caspase-1, which mediates the maturation of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta. Here, we investigated how the NLRP3 inflammasome is regulated. We found that its activation in primary mouse macrophages induced the Src family kinase Lyn to phosphorylate NLRP3 at Tyr(918), which correlated with a subsequent increase in its ubiquitination that facilitated its proteasome-mediated degradation. NLRP3 tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination was abrogated in Lyn-deficient macrophages, which produced increased amounts of IL-1beta. Furthermore, mice lacking Lyn were more susceptible to LPS-induced septic shock in an NLRP3-dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that Lyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is a prerequisite for the ubiquitination that dampens NLRP3 inflammasome activity.
PXD014227	34702373	Multiomics landscape of the autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells. 	Genotyping, generation and lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation identification of the first human autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II specific induced pluripotent stem cells	2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, CLCN7, iPSCs, osteopetrosis, whole exome sequencing	BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II (ADO2) is a genetically and phenotypically metabolic bone disease, caused by osteoclast abnormalities. The pathways dysregulated in ADO2 could lead to the defects in osteoclast formation and function. However, the mechanism remains elusive. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To systematically explore the molecular characterization of ADO2, we performed a multi-omics profiling from the autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II iPSCs (ADO2-iPSCs) and healthy normal control iPSCs (NC-iPSCs) using whole genome re-sequencing, DNA methylation and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) analysis in this study. RESULTS: Totally, we detected 7,095,817 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1,179,573 insertion and deletions (InDels), 1,001,943 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 2984 differential m6A peaks, and the comprehensive multi-omics profile was generated from the two cells. Interestingly, the ISG15 m6A level in ADO2-iPSCs is higher than NC-iPSCs by IGV software, and the differentially expressed m6A-modified genes (DEMGs) were highly enriched in the osteoclast differentiation and p53 signaling pathway, which associated with the development of osteopetrosis. In addition, combining our previously published transcriptome and proteome datasets, we found that the change in DNA methylation levels correlates inversely with some gene expression levels. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the global multi-omics landscape not only provides a high-quality data resource but also reveals a dynamic pattern of gene expression, and found that the pathogenesis of ADO2 may begin early in life.
PXD027426	34702921	A multi-proxy approach to exploring Homo sapiens' arrival, environments and adaptations in Southeast Asia. 	Nam Lot enamel proteome: part of a multi-proxy approach to exploring Homo sapiens arrival, environments and adaptations in Southeast Asia	Enamel, Pleistocene, human evolution, palaeproteomics	The capability of Pleistocene hominins to successfully adapt to different types of tropical forested environments has long been debated. In order to investigate environmental changes in Southeast Asia during a critical period for the turnover of hominin species, we analysed palaeoenvironmental proxies from five late Middle to Late Pleistocene faunas. Human teeth discoveries have been reported at Duoi U'Oi, Vietnam (70-60 ka) and Nam Lot, Laos (86-72 ka). However, the use of palaeoproteomics allowed us to discard the latter, and, to date, no human remains older than ~ 70 ka are documented in the area. Our findings indicate that tropical rainforests were highly sensitive to climatic changes over that period, with significant fluctuations of the canopy forests. Locally, large-bodied faunas were resilient to these fluctuations until the cooling period of the Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS 4; 74-59 ka) that transformed the overall biotope. Then, under strong selective pressures, populations with new phenotypic characteristics emerged while some other species disappeared. We argue that this climate-driven shift offered new foraging opportunities for hominins in a novel rainforest environment and was most likely a key factor in the settlement and dispersal of our species during MIS 4 in SE Asia.
PXD022325	34703030	Clonal populations of a human TNBC model display significant functional heterogeneity and divergent growth dynamics in distinct contexts. 	Proteomic analysis to examine the functional consequences of intratumor heterogeneity	Human breast cancer cell line, Intratumor heterogeneityr, MDA-MB-468, Subclonal population (SCPs), TMT	Intratumoral heterogeneity has been described for various tumor types and models of human cancer, and can have profound effects on tumor progression and drug resistance. This study describes an in-depth analysis of molecular and functional heterogeneity among subclonal populations (SCPs) derived from a single triple-negative breast cancer cell line, including copy number analysis, whole-exome and RNA sequencing, proteome analysis, and barcode analysis of clonal dynamics, as well as functional assays. The SCPs were found to have multiple unique genetic alterations and displayed significant variation in anchorage independent growth and tumor forming ability. Analyses of clonal dynamics in SCP mixtures using DNA barcode technology revealed selection for distinct clonal populations in different in vitro and in vivo environmental contexts, demonstrating that in vitro propagation of cancer cell lines using different culture conditions can contribute to the establishment of unique strains. These analyses also revealed strong enrichment of a single SCP during the development of xenograft tumors in immune-compromised mice. This SCP displayed attenuated interferon signaling in vivo and reduced sensitivity to the antiproliferative effects of type I interferons. Reduction in interferon signaling was found to provide a selective advantage within the xenograft microenvironment specifically. In concordance with the previously described role of interferon signaling as tumor suppressor, these findings suggest that similar selective pressures may be operative in human cancer and patient-derived xenograft models.
PXD026711	34704600	Low kindlin-3 levels in osteoclasts of kindlin-3 hypomorphic mice result in osteopetrosis due to leaky sealing zones. 	Low kindlin-3 levels in osteoclasts of kindlin-3 hypomorphic mice result in osteopetrosis due to leaky sealing zones	Kindlin-3, bone resorption, integrin, osteoclast, podosome, sealing zone	Osteoclasts form special integrin-mediated adhesion structures called sealing zones that enable them to adhere to and resorb bone. Sealing zones consist of densely packed podosomes tightly interconnected by actin fibers. Their formation requires the presence of the hematopoietic integrin regulator kindlin-3 (also known as Fermt3). In this study, we investigated osteoclasts and their adhesion structures in kindlin-3 hypomorphic mice expressing only 5-10% of the kindlin-3 level of wild-type mice. Low kindlin-3 expression reduces integrin activity, results in impaired osteoclast adhesion and signaling, and delays cell spreading. Despite these defects, in vitro-generated kindlin-3-hypomorphic osteoclast-like cells arrange their podosomes into adhesion patches and belts, but their podosome and actin organization is abnormal. Remarkably, kindlin-3-hypomorphic osteoclasts form sealing zones when cultured on calcified matrix in vitro and on bone surface in vivo. However, functional assays, immunohistochemical staining and electron micrographs of bone sections showed that they fail to seal the resorption lacunae properly, which is required for secreted proteinases to digest bone matrix. This results in mild osteopetrosis. Our study reveals a new, hitherto understudied function of kindlin-3 as an essential organizer of integrin-mediated adhesion structures, such as sealing zones.
PXD026631	34704828	Evaluation of RNAlater as a Field-Compatible Preservation Method for Metaproteomic Analyses of Bacterium-Animal Symbioses. 	Repetition of comparison of sample preservation methods for field collection of animal-microbe symbioses for metaproteomic analyses	1D-LC, Olavius algarvensis, RNAlater, chemosynthetic symbiosis, field samples, gutless oligochaetes, metaproteome, metaproteomics, microbiom, proteobacteria, sample preservation, thiotrophic endosymbionts	Field studies are central to environmental microbiology and microbial ecology, because they enable studies of natural microbial communities. Metaproteomics, the study of protein abundances in microbial communities, allows investigators to study these communities "in situ," which requires protein preservation directly in the field because protein abundance patterns can change rapidly after sampling. Ideally, a protein preservative for field deployment works rapidly and preserves the whole proteome, is stable in long-term storage, is nonhazardous and easy to transport, and is available at low cost. Although these requirements might be met by several protein preservatives, an assessment of their suitability under field conditions when targeted for metaproteomic analyses is currently lacking. Here, we compared the protein preservation performance of flash freezing and the preservation solution RNAlater using the marine gutless oligochaete Olavius algarvensis and its symbiotic microbes as a test case. In addition, we evaluated long-term RNAlater storage after 1 day, 1 week, and 4 weeks at room temperature (22degreesC to 23degreesC). We evaluated protein preservation using one-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We found that RNAlater and flash freezing preserved proteins equally well in terms of total numbers of identified proteins and relative abundances of individual proteins, and none of the test time points was altered, compared to time zero. Moreover, we did not find biases against specific taxonomic groups or proteins with particular biochemical properties. Based on our metaproteomic data and the logistical requirements for field deployment, we recommend RNAlater for protein preservation of field-collected samples targeted for metaproteomic analyses. IMPORTANCE Metaproteomics, the large-scale identification and quantification of proteins from microbial communities, provide direct insights into the phenotypes of microorganisms on the molecular level. To ensure the integrity of the metaproteomic data, samples need to be preserved immediately after sampling to avoid changes in protein abundance patterns. In laboratory setups, samples for proteomic analyses are most commonly preserved by flash freezing; however, liquid nitrogen or dry ice is often unavailable at remote field locations, due to their hazardous nature and transport restrictions. Our study shows that RNAlater can serve as a low-hazard, easy-to-transport alternative to flash freezing for field preservation of samples for metaproteomic analyses. We show that RNAlater preserves the metaproteome equally well, compared to flash freezing, and protein abundance patterns remain stable during long-term storage for at least 4 weeks at room temperature.
PXD028143	34706266	GCN2 adapts protein synthesis to scavenging-dependent growth. 	GCN2 Adapts Protein Synthesis to Scavenging-Dependent Growth	GCN2, PDAC, macropinocytosis	Pancreatic cancer cells with limited access to free amino acids can grow by scavenging extracellular protein. In a murine model of pancreatic cancer, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen for genes required for scavenging-dependent growth. The screen identified key mediators of macropinocytosis, peripheral lysosome positioning, endosome-lysosome fusion, lysosomal protein catabolism, and translational control. The top hit was GCN2, a kinase that suppresses translation initiation upon amino acid depletion. Using isotope tracers, we show that GCN2 is not required for protein scavenging. Instead, GCN2 prevents ribosome stalling but without slowing protein synthesis; cells still use all of the limiting amino acids as they emerge from lysosomes. GCN2 also adapts gene expression to the nutrient-poor environment, reorienting protein synthesis away from ribosomes and toward lysosomal hydrolases, such as cathepsin L. GCN2, cathepsin L, and the other genes identified in the screen are potential therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer.
PXD023376	34707096	In-depth proteomic profiling captures subtype-specific features of craniopharyngiomas. 	Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of craniopharyngioma tissues	LFQ, craniopharyngioma	Craniopharyngiomas are rare epithelial tumors derived from pituitary gland embryonic tissue. This epithelial tumor can be categorized as an adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) or papillary craniopharyngioma (PCP) subtype with histopathological and genetic differences. Genomic and transcriptomic profiles of craniopharyngiomas have been investigated; however, the proteomic profile has yet to be elucidated and added to these profiles. Recent improvements in high-throughput quantitative proteomic approaches have introduced new opportunities for a better understanding of these diseases and the efficient discovery of biomarkers. We aimed to confirm subtype-associated proteomic changes between ACP and PCP specimens. We performed a system-level proteomic study using an integrated approach that combines mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic, statistical, and bioinformatics analyses. The bioinformatics analysis showed that differentially expressed proteins between ACP and PCP were significantly involved in mitochondrial organization, fatty acid metabolic processes, exocytosis, the inflammatory response, the cell cycle, RNA splicing, cell migration, and neuron development. Furthermore, using network analysis, we identified hub proteins that were positively correlated with ACP and PCP phenotypes. Our findings improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of craniopharyngiomas and provide novel insights that may ultimately translate to the development of craniopharyngioma subtype-specific therapeutics.
PXD025975	34707166	Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 signaling behind neural invasion linked with lymphatic and vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer. 	Pancreatic cancer proteome from paraffin-embedded tissue	pancreas, paraffin-embedded	Perineural invasion (PNI) is a typical poor prognostic factor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The mechanisms linking PNI to poor prognosis remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify what changes occurred alongside PNI in PDAC. A 128-patient cohort undergoing surgery for early-stage PDAC was evaluated. Subdivided into two groups, according to pathological state, a pancreatic nerve invasion (ne) score of less than three (from none to moderate invasion) was designated as the low-grade ne group. The high-grade (marked invasion) ne group (74 cases, 57.8%) showed a higher incidence of lymphatic metastasis (P = 0.002), a higher incidence of early recurrence (P = 0.004), decreased RFS (P < 0.001), and decreased DSS (P < 0.001). The severity of lymphatic (r = 0.440, P = 0.042) and venous (r = 0.610, P = 0.002) invasions was positively correlated with the ne score. Tumors having abundant stroma often displayed severe ne. Proteomics identified eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (EIF2) signaling as the most significantly enriched pathway in high-grade ne PDAC. Additionally, EIF2 signaling-related ribosome proteins decreased according to severity. Results showed that PNI is linked with lymphatic and vascular invasion in early-stage PDAC. Furthermore, the dysregulation of proteostasis and ribosome biogenesis can yield a difference in PNI severity.
PXD025700	34707224	Appressorium-mediated plant infection by Magnaporthe oryzae is regulated by a Pmk1-dependent hierarchical transcriptional network. 	A hierarchical transcriptional network controls appressorium-1 mediated plant 2 infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae	MAP kinase, Magnaporthe oryzae, Phosphorylation, Rice blast, Transcription	Rice blast is a devastating disease caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae that threatens rice production around the world. The fungus produces a specialized infection cell, called the appressorium, that enables penetration through the plant cell wall in response to surface signals from the rice leaf. The underlying biology of plant infection, including the regulation of appressorium formation, is not completely understood. Here we report the identification of a network of temporally coregulated transcription factors that act downstream of the Pmk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to regulate gene expression during appressorium-mediated plant infection. We show that this tiered regulatory mechanism involves Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation of the Hox7 homeobox transcription factor, which regulates genes associated with induction of major physiological changes required for appressorium development-including cell-cycle control, autophagic cell death, turgor generation and melanin biosynthesis-as well as controlling a additional set of virulence-associated transcription factor-encoding genes. Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation of Mst12 then regulates gene functions involved in septin-dependent cytoskeletal re-organization, polarized exocytosis and effector gene expression, which are necessary for plant tissue invasion. Identification of this regulatory cascade provides new potential targets for disease intervention.
PXD027332	34707570	Hepatic Steatosis Contributes to the Development of Muscle Atrophy via Inter-Organ Crosstalk. 	Hepatic steatosis contributes to the development of muscle atrophy via inter-organ crosstalk	Liver steatosis, NAFLD, insulin resistance, inter-organ crosstalk, metabolism, muscle atrophy	Individuals with hepatic steatosis often display several metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance and muscle atrophy. Previously, we found that hepatic steatosis results in an altered hepatokine secretion profile, thereby inducing skeletal muscle insulin resistance via inter-organ crosstalk. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the altered secretion profile in the state of hepatic steatosis also induces skeletal muscle atrophy via effects on muscle protein turnover. To investigate this, eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a chow (4.5% fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD; 45% fat) for 12 weeks to induce hepatic steatosis, after which the livers were excised and cut into ~200-microm slices. Slices were cultured to collect secretion products (conditioned medium; CM). Differentiated L6-GLUT4myc myotubes were incubated with chow or HFD CM to measure glucose uptake. Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were incubated with chow or HFD CM to measure protein synthesis and breakdown, and gene expression via RNA sequencing. Furthermore, proteomics analysis was performed in chow and HFD CM. It was found that HFD CM caused insulin resistance in L6-GLUT4myc myotubes compared with chow CM, as indicated by a blunted insulin-stimulated increase in glucose uptake. Furthermore, protein breakdown was increased in C2C12 cells incubated with HFD CM, while there was no effect on protein synthesis. RNA profiling of C2C12 cells indicated that 197 genes were differentially expressed after incubation with HFD CM, compared with chow CM, and pathway analysis showed that pathways related to anatomical structure and function were enriched. Proteomics analysis of the CM showed that 32 proteins were differentially expressed in HFD CM compared with chow CM. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these proteins had important functions with respect to insulin-like growth factor transport and uptake, and affect post-translational processes, including protein folding, protein secretion and protein phosphorylation. In conclusion, the results of this study support the hypothesis that secretion products from the liver contribute to the development of muscle atrophy in individuals with hepatic steatosis.
PXD025168	34709689	Dynamic light- and acetate-dependent regulation of the proteome and lysine acetylome of Chlamydomonas. 	Dynamic regulation of the proteome and lysine acetylome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in dependence on light and acetate	DiMethyl, Lysine acetylation, PTM, acK, chlamydomonas reinhardtii	The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is one of the most studied microorganisms in photosynthesis research and for biofuel production. A detailed understanding of the dynamic regulation of its carbon metabolism is therefore crucial for metabolic engineering. Post-translational modifications can act as molecular switches for the control of protein function. Acetylation of the epsilon-amino group of lysine residues is a dynamic modification on proteins across organisms from all kingdoms. Here, we performed mass spectrometry-based profiling of proteome and lysine acetylome dynamics in Chlamydomonas under varying growth conditions. Chlamydomonas liquid cultures were transferred from mixotrophic (light and acetate as carbon source) to heterotrophic (dark and acetate) or photoautotrophic (light only) growth conditions for 30 h before harvest. In total, 5863 protein groups and 1376 lysine acetylation sites were identified with a false discovery rate of <1%. As a major result of this study, our data show that dynamic changes in the abundance of lysine acetylation on various enzymes involved in photosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and the glyoxylate cycle are dependent on acetate and light. Exemplary determination of acetylation site stoichiometries revealed particularly high occupancy levels on K175 of the large subunit of RuBisCO and K99 and K340 of peroxisomal citrate synthase under heterotrophic conditions. The lysine acetylation stoichiometries correlated with increased activities of cellular citrate synthase and the known inactivation of the Calvin-Benson cycle under heterotrophic conditions. In conclusion, the newly identified dynamic lysine acetylation sites may be of great value for genetic engineering of metabolic pathways in Chlamydomonas.
PXD028325	34710371	The legumain McPAL1 from Momordica cochinchinensis is a highly stable Asx-specific splicing enzyme. 	Identification of splicing legumain from Momordica cochinchinesis	asparginyl endopeptidase, legumain, vacuolar processing enzyme	Legumains, also known as asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs), cleave peptide bonds after Asn/Asp (Asx) residues. In plants, certain legumains also have ligase activity that catalyzes biosynthesis of Asx-containing cyclic peptides. An example is the biosynthesis of MCoTI-I/II, a squash family-derived cyclic trypsin inhibitor, which involves splicing to remove the N-terminal prodomain and then N-to-C-terminal cyclization of the mature domain. To identify plant legumains responsible for the maturation of these cyclic peptides, we have isolated and characterized a legumain involved in splicing, McPAL1, from Momordica cochinchinensis (Cucurbitaceae) seeds. Functional studies show that recombinantly expressed McPAL1 displays a pH-dependent, trimodal enzymatic profile. At pH 4 to 6, McPAL1 selectively catalyzed Asp-ligation and Asn-cleavage, but at pH 6.5 to 8, Asn-ligation predominated. With peptide substrates containing N-terminal Asn and C-terminal Asp, such as is found in precursors of MCoTI-I/II, McPAL1 mediates proteolysis at the Asn site and then ligation at the Asp site at pH 5 to 6. Also, McPAL1 is an unusually stable legumain that is tolerant of heat and high pH. Together, our results support that McPAL1 is a splicing legumain at acidic pH that can mediate biosynthesis of MCoTI-I/II. We purport that the high thermal and pH stability of McPAL1 could have applications for protein engineering.
PXD021464	34710551	Identifying the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 interactome through the proximity-dependent biotin identification assay. 	Identifying the BACE1 interactome through BioID proximity assay	BACE1  interactome  Alzheimer	Beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a key drug target against Alzheimer's Disease however, due to its promiscuous proteolytic activity, little is known about its physiological functions. Previous studies have analysed BACE1 cleavage products to examine BACE1 interactions and determine substrates, but these studies cannot establish non-enzymatic (and potentially functional) associations. This study used the biotin identification proximity assay to establish the BACE1 interactome in healthy neuronal cells and identified interactions involved in BACE1 trafficking, post-translational modification and substrates. Furthermore, this method has identified a putative novel role for BACE1 in sex hormone signalling and haem regulation through interaction with the progesterone receptor membrane component 2 (PGRC2). Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021464.
PXD029276	34710562	The ETT2 transcriptional regulator EivF affects the serum resistance and pathogenicity of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli. 	Proteomics of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli ETT2 deletion strain and wild-type strain cultured in serum	APEC, ETT2, serum resistance	Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), a pathotype of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), can cause serious systemic infectious diseases in poultry. Escherichia coli type III secretion system 2 (ETT2) is widely distributed in E. coli strains, including ExPEC and Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). The transcriptional regulator EivF, which is located at the ETT2 cluster, affects the secretion of LEE-encoded proteins and increases bacterial adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cells in EHEC O157:H7. In a previous study, we demonstrated the transcriptional regulator can affect APEC's motility and biofilm formation. Here, we evaluated whether EivF is involved in the pathogenicity of APEC, and we found that inactivation of eivF significantly enhanced resistance to the serum, adherence to chicken embryo fibroblast (DF-1) cells, and the colonization ability of APEC in chicks. To further clarify the regulation mechanism of transcriptional regulator EivF, we performed transcriptome sequencing to analyze the differentially expressed genes and pathways, showing that EivF regulates membrane, adhesion, environmental stress, and secretion protein genes, and EivF is involved in the localization, biological adhesion, biological regulation, membrane, and toxin activity. These findings indicated that the ETT2 transcriptional regulator EivF plays a crucial role in the pathogenicity of APEC as a negative repressor.
PXD025646	34711247	Serum peptidome: diagnostic window into pathogenic processes following occupational exposure to carbon nanomaterials. 	Serum Peptidome: Diagnostic Window into Pathogenic Processes following Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanomaterials	biomarkers, carbon nanotubes, health outcomes, peptidomics, vascular	BACKGROUND: Growing industrial use of carbon nanotubes and nanofibers (CNT/F) warrants consideration of human health outcomes. CNT/F produces pulmonary, cardiovascular, and other toxic effects in animals along with a significant release of bioactive peptides into the circulation, the augmented serum peptidome. While epidemiology among CNT/F workers reports on few acute symptoms, there remains concern over sub-clinical CNT/F effects that may prime for chronic disease, necessitating sensitive health outcome diagnostic markers for longitudinal follow-up. METHODS: Here, the serum peptidome was assessed for its biomarker potential in detecting sub-symptomatic pathobiology among CNT/F workers using label-free data-independent mass spectrometry. Studies employed a stratified design between High (> 0.5 microg/m(3)) and Low (< 0.1 microg/m(3)) inhalable CNT/F exposures in the industrial setting. Peptide biomarker model building and refinement employed linear regression and partial least squared discriminant analyses. Top-ranked peptides were then sequence identified and evaluated for pathological-relevance. RESULTS: In total, 41 peptides were found to be highly discriminatory after model building with a strong linear correlation to personal CNT/F exposure. The top-five peptide model offered ideal prediction with high accuracy (Q(2) = 0.99916). Unsupervised validation affirmed 43.5% of the serum peptidomic variance was attributable to CNT/F exposure. Peptide sequence identification reveals a predominant association with vascular pathology. ARHGAP21, ADAM15 and PLPP3 peptides suggest heightened cardiovasculature permeability and F13A1, FBN1 and VWDE peptides infer a pro-thrombotic state among High CNT/F workers. CONCLUSIONS: The serum peptidome affords a diagnostic window into sub-symptomatic pathology among CNT/F exposed workers for longitudinal monitoring of systemic health risks.
PXD028335	34711841	Oncogene-mediated metabolic gene signature predicts breast cancer outcome. 	Oncogene-Mediated Metabolic Gene Signature Predicts Breast Cancer Outcome	TROP2, breast cancer	Breast cancer remains the second most lethal cancer among women in the United States and triple-negative breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype with limited treatment options. Trop2, a cell membrane glycoprotein, is overexpressed in almost all epithelial cancers. In this study, we demonstrate that Trop2 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and downregulation of Trop2 delays TNBC cell and tumor growth supporting the oncogenic role of Trop2 in breast cancer. Through proteomic profiling, we discovered a metabolic signature comprised of TALDO1, GPI, LDHA, SHMT2, and ADK proteins that were downregulated in Trop2-depleted breast cancer tumors. The identified oncogene-mediated metabolic gene signature is significantly upregulated in TNBC patients across multiple RNA-expression clinical datasets. Our study further reveals that the metabolic gene signature reliably predicts poor survival of breast cancer patients with early stages of the disease. Taken together, our study identified a new five-gene metabolic signature as an accurate predictor of breast cancer outcome.
PXD027746	34712237	Identification of Cell Surface Molecules That Determine the Macrophage Activation Threshold Associated With an Early Stage of Malignant Transformation. 	Identification of differently expressed proteins in breast cancer progression	2D-DIGE, ProteomeXchange project tag: Cancer (B/D-HPP), breast cancer, mass spectometry	The ability of immune cells to sense changes associated with malignant transformation as early as possible is likely to be important for the successful outcome of cancer immunosurveillance. In this process, the immune system faces a trade-off between elimination of cells harboring premalignant or malignant changes, and autoimmune pathologies. We hypothesized that the immune system has therefore evolved a threshold for the stage of transformation from normal to fully malignant cells that first provides a threat (danger) signal requiring a response. We co-cultured human macrophages with a unique set of genetically related human cell lines that recapitulate successive stages in breast cancer development: MCF10A (immortalized, normal); MCFNeoT (benign hyperplasia); MCFT1 (atypical hyperplasia); MCFCA1 (invasive cancer). Using cytokines-based assays, we found that macrophages were inert towards MCF10A and MCFNeoT but were strongly activated by MCFT1 and MCFCA1 to produce inflammatory cytokines, placing the threshold for recognition between two premalignant stages, the earlier stage MCFNeoT and the more advanced MCFT1. The cytokine activation threshold paralleled the threshold for enhanced phagocytosis. Using proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we identified surface molecules, some of which are well-known tumor-associated antigens, that were absent or expressed at low levels in MCF10A and MCFNeoT but turned on or over-expressed in MCFT1 and MCFCA1. Adding antibodies specific for two of these molecules, Annexin-A1 and CEACAM1, inhibited macrophage activation, supporting their role as cancer "danger signals" recognized by macrophages.
PXD027272	34712252	O-fucosylation of CPN20 by SPINDLY Derepresses Abscisic Acid Signaling During Seed Germination and Seedling Development. 	O-Fucosylation of CPN20 by SPINDLY Derepresses Abscisic Acid Signaling during Seed Germination and Seedling Development--Partial Submission	CPN20, ETD, O-fucosylation	SPINDLY is involved in some aspects of plant development. However, the nature of this protein as an O-fucosyltransferase was recently discovered. In this study, we show that SPINDLY (SPY) interacts with CPN20 in yeast two-hybrid and split-luc assays, and the interaction is promoted by ABA. CPN20 is a chloroplast-localized co-chaperonin that negatively regulates ABAR-mediated ABA signaling. By using Electron Transfer Dissociation-MS/MS analysis, two O-fucosylation sites, e.g., 116th and 119th threonines, were detected in ectopically expressed CPN20 in mammalian cells and in Arabidopsis. The O-fucosylation at both threonine residues was confirmed by in vitro peptide O-fucosylation assay. We further show that CPN20 accumulates in the chloroplast of spy mutants, suggesting that SPY negatively regulates CPN20 localization in the chloroplast. In vivo protein degradation assay along with CPN20 localization behavior suggest that import of CPN20 into the chloroplast is negatively regulated by SPY. Genetic analysis shows that ABA insensitive phenotypes of spy-3 in terms of seed germination and early seedling development are partially suppressed by the cpn20 mutation, suggesting that CPN20 acts downstream of SPY in this ABA signaling pathway and that there may exist other pathways in parallel with CPN20. Collectively, the above data support the notion that the O-fucosylation of CPN20 by SPY fine-tunes ABA signaling in Arabidopsis.
PXD018412	34713507	Acetylation of conserved lysines fine-tunes mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase activity in land plants. 	Identification of non-specific phosphatases in TCA cycle regulation	TCA cycle, phosphoproteomics, plant, regulation	Plants need to rapidly and flexibly adjust their metabolism to changes of their immediate environment. Since this necessity results from the sessile lifestyle of land plants, key mechanisms for orchestrating central metabolic acclimation are likely to have evolved early. Here, we explore the role of lysine acetylation as a post-translational modification to directly modulate metabolic function. We generated a lysine acetylome of the moss Physcomitrium patens and identified 638 lysine acetylation sites, mostly found in mitochondrial and plastidial proteins. A comparison with available angiosperm data pinpointed lysine acetylation as a conserved regulatory strategy in land plants. Focusing on mitochondrial central metabolism, we functionally analyzed acetylation of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH), which acts as a hub of plant metabolic flexibility. In P. patens mMDH1, we detected a single acetylated lysine located next to one of the four acetylation sites detected in Arabidopsis thaliana mMDH1. We assessed the kinetic behavior of recombinant A. thaliana and P. patens mMDH1 with site-specifically incorporated acetyl-lysines. Acetylation of A. thaliana mMDH1 at K169, K170, and K334 decreases its oxaloacetate reduction activity, while acetylation of P. patens mMDH1 at K172 increases this activity. We found modulation of the malate oxidation activity only in A. thaliana mMDH1, where acetylation of K334 strongly activated it. Comparative homology modeling of MDH proteins revealed that evolutionarily conserved lysines serve as hotspots of acetylation. Our combined analyses indicate lysine acetylation as a common strategy to fine-tune the activity of central metabolic enzymes with likely impact on plant acclimation capacity.
PXD027181	34713732	Thioredoxin-mediated alteration of protein content and cytotoxicity of Acinetobacter baumannii outer membrane vesicles. 	Acinetobacter baumannii Ci79 WT and TrxA mutant outer membrane vesicle proteins	Acinetobacter, OMV, Thioredoxin	Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative bacterium responsible for many hospital-acquired infections including ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis. We have previously identified A. baumannii thioredoxin A protein (TrxA) as a virulence factor with a multitude of functions including reduction of protein disulfides. TrxA plays an important role in resistance to oxidative stress facilitating host immune evasion in part by alteration of type IV pili and cell surface hydrophobicity. Other virulence factors such as outer membrane vesicles (OMV) shed by bacteria have been shown to mediate bacterial intercellular communication and modulate host immune response. To investigate whether OMVs can be modulated by TrxA, we isolated OMVs from wild type (WT) and TrxA-deficient (DeltatrxA) A. baumannii clinical isolate Ci79 and carried out a functional and proteomic comparison. Despite attenuation of DeltatrxA in a mouse challenge model, pulmonary inoculation of DeltatrxA OMVs resulted in increased lung permeability compared to WT OMVs. Furthermore, DeltatrxA OMVs induced more J774 macrophage-like cell death than WT OMVs. This DeltatrxA OMV-mediated cell death was abrogated when cells were incubated with protease-K-treated OMVs suggesting OMV proteins were responsible for cytotoxicity. We therefore compared WT and mutant OMV proteins using proteomic analysis. We observed that up-regulated and unique DeltatrxA OMV proteins consisted of many membrane bound proteins involved in small molecule transport as well as proteolytic activity. Bacterial OmpA, metalloprotease, and fimbrial protein have been shown to enhance mammalian cell apoptosis through various mechanisms. Differential packaging of these proteins in DeltatrxA OMVs may contribute to the increased cytotoxicity observed in this study.
PXD026879	34714154	The Normal Human Adult Hypothalamus Proteomic Landscape: Rise of Neuroproteomics in Biological Psychiatry and Systems Biology. 	Neuroproteomics with Systems Biology: The proteomic landscape of adult human hypothalamus	Human brain, Orbitrap Fusion, adult neurogenesis, autophagy, hypothalamus, neuropeptides., post translational modifications, proteogenomics	The human hypothalamus is central to the regulation of neuroendocrine and neurovegetative systems, as well as modulation of chronobiology and behavioral aspects in human health and disease. Surprisingly, a deep proteomic analysis of the normal human hypothalamic proteome has been missing for such an important organ so far. In this study, we delineated the human hypothalamus proteome using a high-resolution mass spectrometry approach which resulted in the identification of 5349 proteins, while a multiple post-translational modification (PTM) search identified 191 additional proteins, which were missed in the first search. A proteogenomic analysis resulted in the discovery of multiple novel protein-coding regions as we identified proteins from noncoding regions (pseudogenes) and proteins translated from short open reading frames that can be missed using the traditional pipeline of prediction of protein-coding genes as a part of genome annotation. We also identified several PTMs of hypothalamic proteins that may be required for normal hypothalamic functions. Moreover, we observed an enrichment of proteins pertaining to autophagy and adult neurogenesis in the proteome data. We believe that the hypothalamic proteome reported herein would help to decipher the molecular basis for the diverse range of physiological functions attributed to it, as well as its role in neurological and psychiatric diseases. Extensive proteomic profiling of the hypothalamic nuclei would further elaborate on the role and functional characterization of several hypothalamus-specific proteins and pathways to inform future research and clinical discoveries in biological psychiatry, neurology, and system biology.
PXD025038	34714599	Peptide probes containing a non-hydrolyzable phosphotyrosine-mimetic residue for enrichment of protein tyrosine phosphatases. 	Peptide probes containing a non-hydrolyzable phosphotyrosine-mimetic residue as a tool for tyrosine phosphatomics	F2Pmp, PTP, peptide pulldown, phosphatase, phosphatomics, tyrosine phosphatase	We developed peptide probes containing a non-hydrolyzable phosphotyrosine mimetic, 4-[difluoro(phosphono)methyl]-L-phenylalanine (F2 Pmp) for the enrichment of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). We found that different F2 Pmp probes can enrich different PTPs, depending on the probe sequence. Furthermore, proteins containing a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain were enriched together. Importantly, probes containing phosphotyrosine instead of F2 Pmp failed to enrich PTPs due to dephosphorylation during the pulldown step. This enrichment approach using peptides containing F2 Pmp could be a generic tool for tyrosine phosphatome analysis without the use of antibodies.
PXD024006	34714842	Preservation of collagen in the soft tissues of frozen mammoths. 	Preservation of collagen in the soft tissue of frozen mammoths	collagen, mammoth, soft tissue	We investigated the characteristics of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the soft tissue of two frozen baby woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) that died and were buried in Siberian permafrost approximately 40,000 years ago. Morphological and biochemical analyses of mammoth lung and liver demonstrated that those soft tissues were preserved at the gross anatomical and histological levels. The ultrastructure of ECM components, namely a fibrillar structure with a collagen-characteristic pattern of cross-striation, was clearly visible with transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Type I and type IV collagens were detected by immunohistochemical observation. Quantitative amino acid analysis of liver and lung tissues of the baby mammoths indicated that collagenous protein is selectively preserved in these tissues as a main protein. Type I and type III collagens were detected as major components by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis after digestion with trypsin. These results indicate that the triple helical collagen molecule, which is resistant to proteinase digestion, has been preserved in the soft tissues of these frozen mammoths for 40,000 years.
PXD028867	34716321	Inner nuclear protein Matrin-3 coordinates cell differentiation by stabilizing chromatin architecture. 	Inner nuclear protein Matrin-3 coordinates cell differentiation by stabilizing chromatin architecture		Precise control of gene expression during differentiation relies on the interplay of chromatin and nuclear structure. Despite an established contribution of nuclear membrane proteins to developmental gene regulation, little is known regarding the role of inner nuclear proteins. Here we demonstrate that loss of the nuclear scaffolding protein Matrin-3 (Matr3) in erythroid cells leads to morphological and gene expression changes characteristic of accelerated maturation, as well as broad alterations in chromatin organization similar to those accompanying differentiation. Matr3 protein interacts with CTCF and the cohesin complex, and its loss perturbs their occupancy at a subset of sites. Destabilization of CTCF and cohesin binding correlates with altered transcription and accelerated differentiation. This association is conserved in embryonic stem cells. Our findings indicate Matr3 negatively affects cell fate transitions and demonstrate that a critical inner nuclear protein impacts occupancy of architectural factors, culminating in broad effects on chromatin organization and cell differentiation.
PXD028596	34716343	Coordination of fungal biofilm development by extracellular vesicle cargo. 	Coordination of fungal biofilm development by extracellular vesicle cargo	Candida albicans, biofilm, biofilms, extracellular vesicles, matrix proteomics	The fungal pathogen Candida albicans can form biofilms that protect it from drugs and the immune system. The biofilm cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that promote extracellular matrix formation and resistance to antifungal drugs. Here, we define functions for numerous EV cargo proteins in biofilm matrix assembly and drug resistance, as well as in fungal cell adhesion and dissemination. We use a machine-learning analysis of cargo proteomic data from mutants with EV production defects to identify 63 candidate gene products for which we construct mutant and complemented strains for study. Among these, 17 mutants display reduced biofilm matrix accumulation and antifungal drug resistance. An additional subset of 8 cargo mutants exhibit defects in adhesion and/or dispersion. Representative cargo proteins are shown to function as EV cargo through the ability of exogenous wild-type EVs to complement mutant phenotypic defects. Most functionally assigned cargo proteins have roles in two or more of the biofilm phases. Our results support that EVs provide community coordination throughout biofilm development in C. albicans.
PXD029867	34717002	Breviscapine alleviates NASH by inhibiting TGF-beta-activated kinase 1-dependent signaling. 	Protective effects of breviscapine on HFHC diet-induced C57 mice	HFHC diet	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: NAFLD is a key component of metabolic syndrome, ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver to NASH, and is now becoming the leading cause of cirrhosis and HCC worldwide. However, due to the complex and unclear pathophysiological mechanism, there are no specific approved agents for treating NASH. Breviscapine, a natural flavonoid prescription drug isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Erigeron breviscapus, exhibits a wide range of pharmacological properties, including effects on metabolism. However, the anti-NASH efficacy and mechanisms of breviscapine have not yet been characterized. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We evaluated the effects of breviscapine on the development of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in vivo and in vitro under metabolic stress. Breviscapine treatment significantly reduced lipid accumulation, inflammatory cell infiltration, liver injury, and fibrosis in mice fed a high-fat diet, a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet, or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet. In addition, breviscapine attenuated lipid accumulation, inflammation, and lipotoxicity in hepatocytes undergoing metabolic stress. RNA-sequencing and multiomics analyses further indicated that the key mechanism linking the anti-NASH effects of breviscapine was inhibition of TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) phosphorylation and the subsequent mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. Treatment with the TAK1 inhibitor 5Z-7-oxozeaenol abrogated breviscapine-mediated hepatoprotection under metabolic stress. Molecular docking illustrated that breviscapine directly bound to TAK1. CONCLUSION: Breviscapine prevents metabolic stress-induced NASH progression through direct inhibition of TAK1 signaling. Breviscapine might be a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of NASH.
PXD025970	34717622	Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis reveals chemoresistance-related proteins and signaling pathways induced by rhIL-6 in human osteosarcoma cells. 	Protein and Signaling Pathway Responses to rhIL-6 Intervention before Lobaplatin Treatment in Osteosarcoma Cells using Quantitative Phosphoproteome Analysis	IL-6, Lobaplatin, Osteosarcoma, Phosphoproteome Analysis	BACKGROUND: IL-6 plays a pivotal role in resistance to chemotherapeutics, including lobaplatin. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. This study was to investigate the changes in phosphoproteins and their related signaling pathways in the process of IL-6-induced chemoresistance to lobaplain in osteosarcoma cells. METHODS: We performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of the response of SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells to recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) intervention prior to lobaplatin treatment. The cells were divided into the control group (Con), the lobaplatin group (Lob), and the rhIL-6-and-lobaplatin group (IL-6). Three biological replicates of each group were included. The differentially expressed phosphoproteins were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Netphos 3.1 was used for the prediction of kinases, and STRING was used for the visualization of protein-protein interactions. The conserved motifs surrounding the phosphorylated residues were analyzed using the motif-x algorithm. Western blot analysis was performed to verify the differential expression of p-FLNC, its predicted kinase and the related signaling pathway. The results of the bioinformatic analysis were validated by immunohistochemical staining of clinical specimens. RESULTS: In total, 3373 proteins and 12,183 peptides, including 3232 phosphorylated proteins and 11,358 phosphorylated peptides, were identified and quantified. Twenty-three significantly differentially expressed phosphoproteins were identified in the comparison between the IL-6 and Lob groups, and p-FLNC ranked second among these phosphoproteins. GO and KEGG analyses revealed the pivotal role of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in drug resistance induced by rhIL-6. Four motifs, namely, -SPxxK-, -RxxSP-, -SP-, and -SPK-, demonstrated higher expression in the IL-6 group than in the Lob group. The western blot analysis results verified the higher expression of p-FLNC, AKT1, and p-ERK and the lower expression of p-JNK in the IL-6 group than in the Con and Lob groups. The immunohistochemical staining results showed that p-FLNC, AKT1 and p-ERK1/2 were highly expressed in platinum-resistant clinical specimens but weakly expressed in platinum-sensitive specimens, and platinum-resistant osteosarcoma specimens demonstrated weak expression of p-JNK. CONCLUSIONS: This phosphoproteomic study is the first to reveal the signature associated with rhIL-6 intervention before lobaplatin treatment in human osteosarcoma cells. p-FLNC, AKT1, and MAPK signaling contributes to resistance to lobaplatin in osteosarcoma SaOS-2 cells and may represent molecular targets to overcome osteosarcoma chemoresistance.
PXD029017	34718331	Gasdermin D mediates host cell death but not interleukin-1beta secretion in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages. 	Gasdermin D mediates host cell death but not interleukin-1beta secretion in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected macrophages	Cell death, ESX-1, Gasdermin D, Interleukin-1beta, Mitochondria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, NLRP3, inflammasome	Necrotic cell death represents a major pathogenic mechanism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. It is increasingly evident that Mtb induces several types of regulated necrosis but how these are interconnected and linked to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines remains unknown. Exploiting a clinical cohort of tuberculosis patients, we show here that the number and size of necrotic lesions correlates with IL-1beta plasma levels as a strong indicator of inflammasome activation. Our mechanistic studies reveal that Mtb triggers mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) and subsequently extensive macrophage necrosis, which requires activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3-driven mitochondrial damage is dependent on proteolytic activation of the pore-forming effector protein gasdermin D (GSDMD), which links two distinct cell death machineries. Intriguingly, GSDMD, but not the membranolytic mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system, is dispensable for IL-1beta secretion from Mtb-infected macrophages. Thus, our study dissects a novel mechanism of pathogen-induced regulated necrosis by identifying mitochondria as central regulatory hubs capable of delineating cytokine secretion and lytic cell death.
PXD023106	34718742	ID3 promotes homologous recombination via non-transcriptional and transcriptional mechanisms and its loss confers sensitivity to PARP inhibition. 	ID3 Promotes Homologous Recombination via Non-transcriptional and Transcriptional Mechanisms and its loss confers Sensitivity to PARP	DSB, HDR, ID3, PARPi, cancer	The inhibitor of DNA-binding 3 (ID3) is a transcriptional regulator that limits interaction of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors with their target DNA sequences. We previously reported that ID3 loss is associated with mutational signatures linked to DNA repair defects. Here we demonstrate that ID3 exhibits a dual role to promote DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, particularly homologous recombination (HR). ID3 interacts with the MRN complex and RECQL helicase to activate DSB repair and it facilitates RAD51 loading and downstream steps of HR. In addition, ID3 promotes the expression of HR genes in response to ionizing radiation by regulating both chromatin accessibility and activity of the transcription factor E2F1. Consistently, analyses of TCGA cancer patient data demonstrate that low ID3 expression is associated with impaired HR. The loss of ID3 leads to sensitivity of tumor cells to PARP inhibition, offering new therapeutic opportunities in ID3-deficient tumors.
PXD027837	34718744	Formation and persistence of polyglutamine aggregates in mistranslating cells. 	Formation and persistence of polyglutamine aggregates in mistranslating cells	amino acid misincorporation, mistranslation, tRNA	In neurodegenerative diseases, including pathologies with well-known causative alleles, genetic factors that modify severity or age of onset are not entirely understood. We recently documented the unexpected prevalence of transfer RNA (tRNA) mutants in the human population, including variants that cause amino acid mis-incorporation. We hypothesized that a mistranslating tRNA will exacerbate toxicity and modify the molecular pathology of Huntington's disease-causing alleles. We characterized a tRNAPro mutant that mistranslates proline codons with alanine, and tRNASer mutants, including a tRNASerAGA G35A variant with a phenylalanine anticodon (tRNASerAAA) found in ~2% of the population. The tRNAPro mutant caused synthetic toxicity with a deleterious huntingtin poly-glutamine (polyQ) allele in neuronal cells. The tRNASerAAA variant showed synthetic toxicity with proteasome inhibition but did not enhance toxicity of the huntingtin allele. Cells mistranslating phenylalanine or proline codons with serine had significantly reduced rates of protein synthesis. Mistranslating cells were slow but effective in forming insoluble polyQ aggregates, defective in protein and aggregate degradation, and resistant to the neuroprotective integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB). Our findings identify mistranslating tRNA variants as genetic factors that slow protein aggregation kinetics, inhibit aggregate clearance, and increase drug resistance in cellular models of neurodegenerative disease.
PXD028070	34721061	TMT-Based Plasma Proteomics Reveals Dyslipidemia Among Lowlanders During Prolonged Stay at High Altitudes. 	TMT-based plasma proteomics in humans at high altitude	TMT LC-MS/MS, plasma	Acute exposure to high altitude perturbs physiological parameters and induces an array of molecular changes in healthy lowlanders. However, activation of compensatory mechanisms and biological processes facilitates high altitude acclimatization. A large number of lowlanders stay at high altitude regions from weeks to months for work and professional commitments, and thus are vulnerable to altitude-associated disorders. Despite this, there is a scarcity of information for molecular changes associated with long-term stay at high altitudes. In the present study, we evaluated oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) of lowlanders after short- (7 days, HA-D7) and long-term (3 months, HA-D150) stay at high altitudes, and used TMT-based proteomics studies to decipher plasma proteome alterations. We observed improvements in SpO2 levels after prolonged stay, while HR, SBP, and DBP remained elevated as compared with short-term stay. Plasma proteomics studies revealed higher levels of apolipoproteins APOB, APOCI, APOCIII, APOE, and APOL, and carbonic anhydrases (CA1 and CA2) during hypoxia exposure. Biological network analysis also identified profound alterations in lipoprotein-associated pathways like plasma lipoprotein assembly, VLDL clearance, chylomicron assembly, chylomicron remodeling, plasma lipoprotein clearance, and chylomicron clearance. In corroboration, lipid profiling revealed higher levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) for HA-D150 whereas high density lipoproteins (HDL) levels were lower as compared with HA-D7 and sea-level indicating dyslipidemia. We also observed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNFalpha, and CRP for HA-D150 along with oxidized LDL (oxLDL), suggesting vascular inflammation and proartherogenic propensity. These results demonstrate that long-term stay at high altitudes exacerbates dyslipidemia and associated disorders.
PXD028854	34722278	Serum Anti-14-3-3 Zeta Autoantibody as a Biomarker for Predicting Hepatocarcinogenesis. 	Differential proteomics between AFP-negative HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver tissue	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), HCC, Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Liver (B/D-HPP), SWATH-MS	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is still the only serum biomarker widely used in clinical settings. However, approximately 40% of HCC patients exhibit normal AFP levels, including very early HCC and AFP-negative HCC; for these patients, serum AFP is not applicable as a biomarker of early detection. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel biomarkers for patients for whom disease cannot be diagnosed early. In this study, we screened and identified novel proteins in AFP-negative HCC and evaluated the feasibility of using autoantibodies to those protein to predict hepatocarcinogenesis. First, we screened and identified differentially expressed proteins between AFP-negative HCC tissue and adjacent non-tumor liver tissue using SWATH-MS proteome technology. In total, 2,506 proteins were identified with a global false discovery rate of 1%, of which 592 proteins were expressed differentially with 175 upregulated and 417 downregulated (adjusted p-value <0.05, fold-change FC >=1.5 or <=0.67) between the tumor and matched benign samples, including 14-3-3 zeta protein. For further serological verification, autoantibodies against 14-3-3 zeta in serum were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent, Western blotting, and indirect immunofluorescence assays. Five serial serum samples from one patient with AFP-negative HCC showed anti-14-3-3 zeta autoantibody in sera 9 months before the diagnosis of HCC, which gradually increased with an increase in the size of the nodule. Based on these findings, we detected the prevalence of serum anti-14-3-3 zeta autoantibody in liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, which is commonly considered a premalignant liver disease of HCC. We found that the prevalence of autoantibodies against 14-3-3 zeta protein was 16.1% (15/93) in LC patient sera, which was significantly higher than that in patients with chronic hepatitis (0/75, p = 0.000) and normal human sera (1/60, 1.7%, p = 0.01). Therefore, we suggest that anti-14-3-3 zeta autoantibody might be a biomarker for predicting hepatocarcinogenesis. Further follow-up and research of patients with positive autoantibodies will be continued to confirm the relationship between anti-14-3-3 zeta autoantibody and hepatocarcinogenesis.
PXD028446	34722520	Comprehensive Analysis of E3 Ubiquitin Ligases Reveals Ring Finger Protein 223 as a Novel Oncogene Activated by KLF4 in Pancreatic Cancer. 	DIA proteomics analysis of RNF223 knockdown and control pancreatic cancer cell lines	RNF223, quantitative proteomics	Pancreatic cancer is one of the major malignancies and causes of mortality worldwide. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases transfer activated ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to protein substrates and confer substrate specificity in cancer. In this study, we first downloaded data from The Cancer Genome Atlas pancreatic adenocarcinoma dataset, acquired all 27 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and identified genomic alterations. Then, the prognostic significance of DEGs was analyzed, and eight DEGs (MECOM, CBLC, MARCHF4, RNF166, TRIM46, LONRF3, RNF39, and RNF223) and two clinical parameters (pathological N stage and T stage) exhibited prognostic significance. RNF223 showed independent significance as an unfavorable prognostic marker and was chosen for subsequent analysis. Next, the function of RNF223 in the pancreatic cancer cell lines ASPC-1 and PANC-1 was investigated, and RNF223 silencing promoted pancreatic cancer growth and migration. To explore the potential targets and pathways of RNF223 in pancreatic cancer, quantitative proteomics was applied to analyze differentially expressed proteins, and metabolism-related pathways were primarily enriched. Finally, the reason for the elevated expression of RNF223 was analyzed, and KLF4 was shown to contribute to the increased expression of RNF233. In conclusion, this study comprehensively analyzed the clinical significance of E3 ligases. Functional assays revealed that RNF223 promotes cancer by regulating cell metabolism. Finally, the elevated expression of RNF223 was attributed to KLF4-mediated transcriptional activation. This study broadens our knowledge regarding E3 ubiquitin ligases and signal transduction and provides novel markers and therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer.
PXD028633	34723952	Immunopeptidomics: Isolation of Mouse and Human MHC Class I- and II-Associated Peptides for Mass Spectrometry Analysis. 	Isolation of mouse and human MHC class I- and II-associated peptides for the analysis of immunopeptidomes by mass spectrometry	MHC class I associated peptides, MHC class II associated peptides, immunopeptidome	Immunopeptidomics is an emerging field that fuels and guides the development of vaccines and immunotherapies. More specifically, it refers to the science of investigating the composition of peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules using mass spectrometry (MS) technology platforms. Among all the steps in an MS-based immunopeptidomics workflow, sample preparation is critically important for capturing high-quality data of therapeutic relevance. Here, step-by-step instructions are described to isolate MHC class I and II-associated peptides by immunoaffinity purification from quality control samples, from mouse (EL4 and A20), and human (JY) cell lines more specifically. The various reagents and specific antibodies are thoroughly described to isolate MHC-associated peptides from these cell lines, including the steps to verify the beads-binding efficiency of the antibody and the elution efficiency of the MHC-peptide complexes from the beads. The protocol can be used to establish and standardize an immunopeptidomics workflow, as well as to benchmark new protocols. Moreover, the protocol represents a great starting point for any non-experts in addition to foster the intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility of the sample preparation procedure in immunopeptidomics.
PXD026462	34724354	Yields and Immunomodulatory Effects of Pneumococcal Membrane Vesicles Differ with the Bacterial Growth Phase. 	Yield and immunomodulatory effects of pneumococcal membrane vesicles change with bacterial growth phase	Bacterial membrane vesicles, death-phase, immunogenicity, primary macrophages, stationary-phase, vaccine	Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are a leading cause of death worldwide. Bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) are promising vaccine candidates because of the antigenic components of their parent microorganisms. Pneumococcal MVs exhibit low toxicity towards several cell lines, but their clinical translation requires a high yield and strong immunogenic effects without compromising immune cell viability. MVs are isolated during either the stationary phase (24 h) or death phase (48 h), and their yields, immunogenicity and cytotoxicity in human primary macrophages and dendritic cells have been investigated. Death-phase vesicles showed higher yields than stationary-phase vesicles. Both vesicle types displayed acceptable compatibility with primary immune cells and several cell lines. Both vesicle types showed comparable uptake and enhanced release of the inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6, from human primary immune cells. Proteomic analysis revealed similarities in vesicular immunogenic proteins such as pneumolysin, pneumococcal surface protein A, and IgA1 protease in both vesicle types, but stationary-phase MVs showed significantly lower autolysin levels than death-phase MVs. Although death-phase vesicles produced higher yields, they lacked superiority to stationary-phase vesicles as vaccine candidates owing to their similar antigenic protein cargo and comparable uptake into primary human immune cells.
PXD024769	34724812	Malaria Parasite Stress Tolerance Is Regulated by DNMT2-Mediated tRNA Cytosine Methylation. 	Cytosine methylation of tRNA in Plasmodium falciparum disrupts translational homeostasis to prime for sexual commitment	DMT2, Epitranscriptomics, Plasmodium, tRNA	Malaria parasites need to cope with changing environmental conditions that require strong countermeasures to ensure pathogen survival in the human and mosquito hosts. The molecular mechanisms that protect Plasmodium falciparum homeostasis during the complex life cycle remain unknown. Here, we identify cytosine methylation of tRNA(Asp (GTC)) as being critical to maintain stable protein synthesis. Using conditional knockout (KO) of a member of the DNA methyltransferase family, called Pf-DNMT2, RNA bisulfite sequencing demonstrated the selective cytosine methylation of this enzyme of tRNA(Asp (GTC)) at position C38. Although no growth defect on parasite proliferation was observed, Pf-DNMT2KO parasites showed a selective downregulation of proteins with a GAC codon bias. This resulted in a significant shift in parasite metabolism, priming KO parasites for being more sensitive to various types of stress. Importantly, nutritional stress made tRNA(Asp (GTC)) sensitive to cleavage by an unknown nuclease and increased gametocyte production (>6-fold). Our study uncovers an epitranscriptomic mechanism that safeguards protein translation and homeostasis of sexual commitment in malaria parasites. IMPORTANCE P. falciparum is the most virulent malaria parasite species, accounting for the majority of the disease mortality and morbidity. Understanding how this pathogen is able to adapt to different cellular and environmental stressors during its complex life cycle is crucial in order to develop new strategies to tackle the disease. In this study, we identified the writer of a specific tRNA cytosine methylation site as a new layer of epitranscriptomic regulation in malaria parasites that regulates the translation of a subset of parasite proteins (>400) involved in different metabolic pathways. Our findings give insight into a novel molecular mechanism that regulates P. falciparum response to drug treatment and sexual commitment.
PXD018003	34728030	[Proteome and Acetylome Profiling of Livers in C57BL/6J Male Mice during Normal Aging]. 	Multi-omics analysis of natural aging mouse liver	acetylome, aging, liver, metabolome	Objective To obtain the proteome and acetylome profiles of livers in mice during normal aging.Methods We applied tandem mass tag labeling and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and achieved proteome and acetylome data in C57BL/6J male mice aged 2 and 18 months under physiological conditions.Results A total of 4712 proteins were quantified by proteome profiling,and 4818 acetylated sites in 1367 proteins by acetylome profiling.The proteome and acetylome revealed moderate differences in the livers of young and old mice.There were 195 differentially expressed proteins in the proteome and 113 differentially expressed acetylated sites corresponding to 76 proteins in the acetylome.Functional enrichment analysis for the proteome showed that aging-associated upregulated proteins were mainly involved in fatty acid metabolism,epoxygenase P450 pathway,drug catabolic process,organic hydroxy compound metabolic process,and arachidonic acid metabolic process,while the downregulated proteins were related to regulation of gene silencing,nucleosome assembly,protein heterotetramerization,response to interferon,protein-DNA complex assembly and other processes.For the acetylome,the proteins with aging-associated upregulated acetylated sites mainly participated in cofactor metabolism,small molecule catabolic process,ribose phosphate metabolic process,ribonucleotide metabolic process,and purine-containing compound metabolic process,while the proteins with downregulated acetylated sites were associated with sulfur compound metabolic process,response to unfolded protein,and amino acid metabolic process.Conclusion We profiled the proteome and acetylome of livers in mice during normal aging and generated datasets for further research on aging.
PXD028891	34728737	Proteogenomic discovery of sORF-encoded peptides associated with bacterial virulence in Yersinia pestis. 	Proteogenomic Discovery of sORF-encoded Peptides in Yersinia pestis Reveals Regulatory  Phenotype on Bacterial Virulence	Proteogenomics, microbiology, sORFs	Plague caused by Yersinia pestis is one of the deadliest diseases. However, many molecular mechanisms of bacterial virulence remain unclear. This study engaged in the discovery of small open reading frame (sORF)-encoded peptides (SEPs) in Y. pestis. An integrated proteogenomic pipeline was established, and an atlas containing 76 SEPs was described. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that 20% of these SEPs were secreted or localized to the transmembrane and that 33% contained functional domains. Two SEPs, named SEPs-yp1 and -yp2 and encoded in noncoding regions, were selected by comparative peptidomics analysis under host-specific environments and high-salinity stress. They displayed important roles in the regulation of antiphagocytic capability in a thorough functional assay. Remarkable attenuation of virulence in mice was observed in the SEP-deleted mutants. Further global proteomic analysis indicated that SEPs-yp1 and -yp2 affected the bacterial metabolic pathways, and SEP-yp1 was associated with the bacterial virulence by modulating the expression of key virulence factors of the Yersinia type III secretion system. Our study provides a rich resource for research on Y. pestis and plague, and the findings on SEP-yp1 and SEP-yp2 shed light on the molecular mechanism of bacterial virulence.
PXD026640	34730416	Alternative Pathway for 3-Cyanoalanine Assimilation in Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 under Noncyanotrophic Conditions. 	Cyanoalanine in Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344	Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344, cyanide, cyanoalanine, jewelry residue	3-Cyanoalanine and cyanohydrins are intermediate nitriles produced in cyanide degradation pathways in plants and bacteria. 3-Cyanoalanine is generated from cyanide by the 3-cyanoalanine synthase, an enzyme mainly characterized in cyanogenic plants. NIT4-type nitrilases use 3-cyanoalanine as a substrate, forming ammonium and aspartate. In some organisms, this enzyme also generates asparagine through an additional nitrile hydratase activity. The alkaliphilic bacterium Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 assimilates cyanide through an intermediate cyanohydrin, which is further converted into ammonium by the nitrilase NitC. This bacterium also contains three additional nitrilases, including Nit4. In this work, a proteomic analysis of P. pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 cells grown with 3-cyanoalanine as the sole nitrogen source has revealed the overproduction of different proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, including the nitrilase NitC. In contrast, the nitrilase Nit4 was not induced by 3-cyanoalanine, and it was only overproduced in cells grown with a cyanide-containing jewelry-manufacturing residue. Phenotypes of single and double mutant strains defective in nit4 or/and nitC revealed the implication of the nitrilase NitC in the assimilation of 3-cyanoalanine and suggest that the 3-cyanoalanine assimilation pathway in P. pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 depends on the presence or absence of cyanide. When cyanide is present, 3-cyanoalanine is assimilated via Nit4, but in the absence of cyanide, a novel pathway for 3-cyanoalanine assimilation, in which the nitrilase NitC uses the nitrile generated after deamination of the alpha-amino group from 3-cyanoalanine, is proposed. IMPORTANCE Nitriles are organic cyanides with important industrial applications, but they are also found in nature. 3-Cyanoalanine is synthesized by plants and some bacteria to detoxify cyanide from endogenous or exogenous sources, but this nitrile may be also involved in other processes such as stress tolerance, nitrogen and sulfur metabolism, and signaling. The cyanide-degrading bacterium Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 grows with 3-cyanoalanine as the sole nitrogen source, but it does not use this nitrile as an intermediate in the cyanide assimilation pathway. In this work, a quantitative proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed to study, for the first time, the response to 3-cyanoalanine at the proteomic level. Proteomic data, together with phenotypes of different nitrilase-defective mutants of P. pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344, provide evidence that in the absence of cyanide, the nitrilase Nit4 is not involved in 3-cyanoalanine assimilation, and instead, the nitrilase NitC participates in a novel alternative 3-cyanoalanine assimilation pathway.
PXD027300	34730959	Potent Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activity by the Natural Product Gallinamide A and Analogues via Inhibition of Cathepsin L. 	Potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity by the natural product gallinamide A and analogues via inhibition of cathepsin L	COVID, HEK293, MRC5, SARS-CoV-2, VEROE6, cathepsin L, gallinamide A	Cathepsin L is a key host cysteine protease utilized by coronaviruses for cell entry and is a promising drug target for novel antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. The marine natural product gallinamide A and several synthetic analogues were identified as potent inhibitors of cathepsin L with IC50 values in the picomolar range. Lead molecules possessed selectivity over other cathepsins and alternative host proteases involved in viral entry. Gallinamide A directly interacted with cathepsin L in cells and, together with two lead analogues, potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, with EC50 values in the nanomolar range. Reduced antiviral activity was observed in cells overexpressing transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2); however, a synergistic improvement in antiviral activity was achieved when combined with a TMPRSS2 inhibitor. These data highlight the potential of cathepsin L as a COVID-19 drug target as well as the likely need to inhibit multiple routes of viral entry to achieve efficacy.
PXD029137	34731247	Quantification of Soy-Derived Ingredients in Model Bread and Frankfurter Matrices with an Optimized Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry External Standard Calibration Workflow. 	Quantification of Soy-Derived Ingredients in Model Bread and Frankfurter Matrices with an Optimized LC-MS/MS External Standard Calibration Workflow	Food Allergen, Incurred Food Matrices, Parallel Reaction Monitoring, Soybean Allergy	ABSTRACT: The detection and quantification of soy protein is important for food allergen management and identifying the presence of undeclared soy proteins. Heat processing and matrix interactions can affect the accuracy of allergen detection methods. The sensitivity of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods can be compromised if protein epitopes are modified during processing. Therefore, a mass spectrometry (MS)-based method was evaluated for the recovery of total soy protein in incurred matrices. MS-based quantification of total soy protein was assessed by using a combination of external and internal standards. The reproducibility of the standard curves was investigated by comparing within-day and among-day variation. Incurred samples were prepared using bread and frankfurters as model food matrices. Several soy-derived ingredients were used to prepare the matrices with varying levels of soy protein (1, 10, 50, or 100 ppm of total soy protein). A pooled standard curve was used to estimate the total soy protein concentration of the incurred food matrices and the percent total protein recovery. The variation of replicate standard curves between days and among all days was not significant. The differences in slopes obtained from replicate standards run on different days were minimal. The most influential factor on the quantitative protein recovery in incurred samples was the effect of the physical matrix structure on protein extraction. The lowest percent protein recoveries, less than 50%, were calculated for uncooked matrices. The cooked matrices had percentage recoveries between 50 and 150% for all total soy protein levels. Other factors, such as type of ingredient, were determined to be not as impactful on recovery. The MS method described in this study was able to provide sensitive detection and accurate quantification of total soy protein from various soy-derived ingredients present in processed food matrices.
PXD005599	34732145	Phosphoproteome analysis reveals the involvement of protein dephosphorylation in ethylene-induced corolla senescence in petunia. 	Phosphoproteome analysis of petunia corolla treated with ethylene and air	Phosphoproteome, dephosphorylation, ethylene, flower senescence, petunia	BACKGROUND: Senescence represents the last stage of flower development. Phosphorylation is the key posttranslational modification that regulates protein functions, and kinases may be more required than phosphatases during plant growth and development. However, little is known about global phosphorylation changes during flower senescence. RESULTS: In this work, we quantitatively investigated the petunia phosphoproteome following ethylene or air treatment. In total, 2170 phosphosites in 1184 protein groups were identified, among which 2059 sites in 1124 proteins were quantified. To our surprise, treatment with ethylene resulted in 697 downregulated and only 117 upregulated phosphosites using a 1.5-fold threshold (FDR < 0.05), which showed that ethylene negatively regulates global phosphorylation levels and that phosphorylation of many proteins was not necessary during flower senescence. Phosphoproteome analysis showed that ethylene regulates ethylene and ABA signalling transduction pathways via phosphorylation levels. One of the major targets of ethylene-induced dephosphorylation is the plant mRNA splicing machinery, and ethylene treatment increases the number of alternative splicing events of precursor RNAs in petunia corollas. CONCLUSIONS: Protein dephosphorylation could play an important role in ethylene-induced senescence, and ethylene treatment increased the number of AS precursor RNAs in petunia corollas.
PXD028403	34732892	B cell-derived GABA elicits IL-10(+) macrophages to limit anti-tumour immunity. 	B cell-derived GABA elicits IL-10+ macrophages and limits anti-tumor immunity	B cells, GABA, anti-tumor immunity, macrophages	Small, soluble metabolites not only are essential intermediates in intracellular biochemical processes, but can also influence neighbouring cells when released into the extracellular milieu(1-3). Here we identify the metabolite and neurotransmitter GABA as a candidate signalling molecule synthesized and secreted by activated B cells and plasma cells. We show that B cell-derived GABA promotes monocyte differentiation into anti-inflammatory macrophages that secrete interleukin-10 and inhibit CD8(+) T cell killer function. In mice, B cell deficiency or B cell-specific inactivation of the GABA-generating enzyme GAD67 enhances anti-tumour responses. Our study reveals that, in addition to cytokines and membrane proteins, small metabolites derived from B-lineage cells have immunoregulatory functions, which may be pharmaceutical targets allowing fine-tuning of immune responses.
PXD028318	34733165	Serum Amyloid A Correlates With the Osteonecrosis of Femoral Head by Affecting Bone Metabolism. 	Serum amyloid A correlates with the osteonecrosis of femoral head	SAA ONFH Serum	Osteonecrosis of femoral head (ONFH) is a progressive hip joint disease without disease-modifying treatment. Lacking understanding of the pathophysiological process of ONFH has become the humper to develop therapeutic approach. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase lipophilic protein during inflammation and we found that SAA is increased for the first time in the serum of ONFH patients through proteomic studies and quantitatively verified by ELISA. Treating rBMSCs with SAA inhibited the osteogenic differentiation via Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway deactivation and enhanced the adipogenic differentiation via MAPK/PPARgamma signaling pathway activation. Finally, bilateral critical-sized calvarial-defect rat model which received SAA treated rBMSCs demonstrated reduction of bone formation when compared to untreated rBMSCs implantation control. Hence, SAA is a vital protein in the physiological process of ONFH and can act as a potential therapeutic target to treat ONFH.
PXD028236	34733798	Identification of Myoferlin, a Potential Serodiagnostic Antigen of Clonorchiasis, via Immunoproteomic Analysis of Sera From Different Infection Periods and Excretory-Secretory Products of Clonorchis sinensis. 	Label-free LC-MS/MS of proteins derived from excretory secretory products and positive sera of Clonorchis sinensis of rabbit	Excretory secretory products, Sera, rabbit	Clonorchiasis, which is caused by Clonorchis sinensis, is an important foodborne disease worldwide. The excretory-secretory products (ESPs) of C. sinensis play important roles in host-parasite interactions by acting as causative agents. In the present study, the ESPs and sera positive for C. sinensis were collected to identify proteins specific to the sera of C. sinensis (i.e., proteins that do not cross-react with Fasciola hepatica and Schistosoma japonicum) at different infection periods. Briefly, white Japanese rabbits were artificially infected with C. sinensis, and their sera were collected at 7 days post-infection (dpi), 14 dpi, 35 dpi, and 77 dpi. To identify the specific proteins in C. sinensis, a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was conducted using shotgun liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to pull down the sera roots of C. sinensis, F. hepatica, and S. japonicum. For the annotated proteins, 32, 18, 39, and 35 proteins specific to C. sinensis were pulled down by the infected sera at 7, 14, 35, and 77 dpi, respectively. Three proteins, Dynein light chain-1, Dynein light chain-2 and Myoferlin were detected in all infection periods. Of these proteins, myoferlin is known to be overexpressed in several human cancers and could be a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer cases. Accordingly, this protein was selected for further studies. To achieve a better expression, myoferlin was truncated into two parts, Myof1 and Myof2 (1,500 bp and 810 bp), based on the antigenic epitopes provided by bioinformatics. The estimated molecular weight of the recombinant proteins was 57.3 ku (Myof1) and 31.3 ku (Myof2). Further, both Myof1 and Myof2 could be probed by the sera from rabbits infected with C. sinensis. No cross-reaction occurred with the positive sera of S. japonica, F. hepatica, and negative controls. Such findings indicate that myoferlin may be an important diagnostic antigen present in the ESPs. Overall, the present study provides new insights into proteomic changes between ESPs and hosts in different infection periods by LC-MS/MS. Moreover, myoferlin, as a biomarker, may be used to develop an objective method for future diagnosis of clonorchiasis.
PXD026547	34734993	Respiratory and C4-photosynthetic NAD-malic enzyme coexist in bundle sheath cell mitochondria and evolved via association of differentially adapted subunits. 	Respiratory and C4-photosynthetic NAD-malic enzyme coexist in bundle sheath cells mitochondria and evolved via association of differentially adapted subunits	C4-photosynthesis, Cleomaceae, NAD-malic enzyme, photosynthesis, plant, respiration	In plant mitochondria, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) has a housekeeping function in malate respiration. In different plant lineages, NAD-ME was independently co-opted in C4 photosynthesis. In the C4 Cleome species, Gynandropsis gynandra and Cleome angustifolia, all NAD-ME genes (NAD-MEalpha, NAD-MEbeta1, and NAD-MEbeta2) were affected by C4 evolution and are expressed at higher levels than their orthologs in the C3 species Tarenaya hassleriana. In T. hassleriana, the NAD-ME housekeeping function is performed by two heteromers, NAD-MEalpha/beta1 and NAD-MEalpha/beta2, with similar biochemical properties. In both C4 species, this role is restricted to NAD-MEalpha/beta2. In the C4 species, NAD-MEalpha/beta1 is exclusively present in the leaves, where it accounts for most of the enzymatic activity. Gynandropsis gynandra NAD-MEalpha/beta1 (GgNAD-MEalpha/beta1) exhibits high catalytic efficiency and is differentially activated by the C4 intermediate aspartate, confirming its role as the C4-decarboxylase. During C4 evolution, NAD-MEbeta1 lost its catalytic activity; its contribution to the enzymatic activity results from a stabilizing effect on the associated alpha-subunit and the acquisition of regulatory properties. We conclude that in bundle sheath cell mitochondria of C4 species, the functions of NAD-ME as C4 photosynthetic decarboxylase and as a housekeeping enzyme coexist and are performed by isoforms that combine the same alpha-subunit with differentially adapted beta-subunits.
PXD027786	34736896	beta-synuclein potentiates synaptic vesicle dopamine uptake and rescues dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induced death in the absence of other synucleins. 	Beta-synuclein potentiates synaptic vesicle dopamine uptake and rescues dopaminergic neurons from MPTP-induced death in the absence of other synucleins	MPTP toxicity, Parkinson's disease, dopamine, dopaminergic neurons, neurodegenerative disease, neurotransmitter vesicular uptake, synapse, synuclein, transgenic mice, vesicles	Synucleins, a family of three proteins highly expressed in neurons, are predominantly known for the direct involvement of alpha-synuclein in the etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's and certain other neurodegenerative diseases, but their precise physiological functions are still not fully understood. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of alpha-synuclein as a modulator of various mechanisms implicated in chemical neurotransmission, but information concerning the involvement of other synuclein family members, beta-synuclein and gamma-synuclein, in molecular processes within presynaptic terminals is limited. Here, we demonstrated that the vesicular monoamine transporter 2-dependent dopamine uptake by synaptic vesicles isolated from the striatum of mice lacking beta-synuclein is significantly reduced. Reciprocally, reintroduction, either in vivo or in vitro, of beta-synuclein but not alpha-synuclein or gamma-synuclein improves uptake by triple alpha/beta/gamma-synuclein-deficient striatal vesicles. We also showed that the resistance of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta to subchronic administration of the Parkinson's disease-inducing prodrug 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine depends on the presence of beta-synuclein but only when one or both other synucleins are absent. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of synuclein-deficient synaptic vesicles versus those containing only beta-synuclein revealed differences in their protein compositions. We suggest that the observed potentiation of dopamine uptake by beta-synuclein might be caused by different protein architecture of the synaptic vesicles. It is also feasible that such structural changes improve synaptic vesicle sequestration of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, a toxic metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, which would explain why dopaminergic neurons expressing beta-synuclein and lacking alpha-synuclein and/or gamma-synuclein are resistant to this neurotoxin.
PXD024582	34739170	Proteasome inhibition alters mitotic progression through the upregulation of centromeric alpha-Satellite RNAs. 	Identification of alpha-satellite RNA interacting proteins	RNA pulldown, alpha satellite, ncRNA	Cell cycle progression requires control of the abundance of several proteins and RNAs over space and time to properly transit from one phase to the next and to ensure faithful genomic inheritance in daughter cells. The proteasome, the main protein degradation system of the cell, facilitates the establishment of a proteome specific to each phase of the cell cycle. Its activity also strongly influences transcription. Here, we detected the upregulation of repetitive RNAs upon proteasome inhibition in human cancer cells using RNA-seq. The effect of proteasome inhibition on centromeres was remarkable, especially on alpha-Satellite RNAs. We showed that alpha-Satellite RNAs fluctuate along the cell cycle and interact with members of the cohesin ring, suggesting that these transcripts may take part in the regulation of mitotic progression. Next, we forced exogenous overexpression and used gapmer oligonucleotide targeting to demonstrate that alpha-Sat RNAs have regulatory roles in mitosis. Finally, we explored the transcriptional regulation of alpha-Satellite DNA. Through in silico analyses, we detected the presence of CCAAT transcription factor-binding motifs within alpha-Satellite centromeric arrays. Using high-resolution three-dimensional immuno-FISH and ChIP-qPCR, we showed an association between the alpha-Satellite upregulation and the recruitment of the transcription factor NFY-A to the centromere upon MG132-induced proteasome inhibition. Together, our results show that the proteasome controls alpha-Satellite RNAs associated with the regulation of mitosis.
PXD026986	34739247	Flashlight into the Function of Unannotated C11orf52 using Affinity Purification Mass Spectrometry. 	C11orf52_uPE1study_for_CHPP_using_Immunoprecipitation	Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP), c-hpp, hpp, upe1	For an enhanced understanding of the biological mechanisms of human disease, it is essential to investigate protein functions. In a previous study, we developed a prediction method of gene ontology (GO) terms by the I-TASSER/COFACTOR result, and we applied this to uPE1 in chromosome 11. Here, to validate the bioinformatics prediction of C11orf52, we utilized affinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify interacting partners of C11orf52. Using immunoprecipitation methods with three different peptide tags (Myc, Flag, and 2B8) in HEK 293T cell lines, we identified 79 candidate proteins that are expected to interact with C11orf52. The results of a pathway analysis of the GO and STRING database with candidate proteins showed that C11orf52 could be related to signaling receptor binding, cell-cell adhesion, and ribosome biogenesis. Then, we selected three partner candidates of DSG1, JUP, and PTPN11 for verification of the interaction with C11orf52 and confirmed them by colocalization at the cell-cell junctions by coimmunofluorescence experiments. On the basis of this study, we expect that C11orf52 is related to the Wnt signaling pathway via DSG1 from the protein-protein interactions, given the results of a comprehensive analysis of the bioinformatic predictions. The data set is available at the ProteomeXchange consortium via PRIDE repository (PXD026986).
PXD069603	34739326	Ubiquitination is essential for recovery of cellular activities after heat shock. 	Profiling the stress-dependent ubiquitinome of HEK293T cells via TUBE-capture and spectral counting proteomics	Ubiquitin, cellular stress, tandem ubiquitin binding entities (TUBE)	Eukaryotic cells respond to stress through adaptive programs that include reversible shutdown of key cellular processes, the formation of stress granules, and a global increase in ubiquitination. The primary function of this ubiquitination is thought to be for tagging damaged or misfolded proteins for degradation. Here, working in mammalian cultured cells, we found that different stresses elicited distinct ubiquitination patterns. For heat stress, ubiquitination targeted specific proteins associated with cellular activities that are down-regulated during stress, including nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation, as well as stress granule constituents. Ubiquitination was not required for the shutdown of these processes or for stress granule formation but was essential for the resumption of cellular activities and for stress granule disassembly. Thus, stress-induced ubiquitination primes the cell for recovery after heat stress.
PXD028871	34740827	CoolTip: Low-Temperature Solid-Phase Extraction Microcolumn for Capturing Hydrophilic Peptides and Phosphopeptides. 	CoolTip: Low-Temperature Solid-Phase Microextraction Tip for Capturing Hydrophilic Phosphopeptides: 2	CoolTip, Phosphoproteomics	Reversed-phase solid-phase extraction (SPE) techniques are commonly used for desalting samples before LC/MS/MS in shotgun proteomics. However, hydrophilic peptides are often lost during the desalting step under the standard SPE conditions. Here, we describe a simple protocol in which a stop-and-go extraction tip packed with a poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) copolymer disc is used at 4 degreesC during sample loading without any organic solvent. Using this method, which we designate as the CoolTip protocol, we identified 2.9-fold more tryptic peptides and 6.1-fold more tryptic phosphopeptides from HeLa lysates than the standard SPE protocol for hydrophilic peptides, with a mobile phase of less than 8% acetonitrile in LC/MS/MS. There was no decrease in the recovery of hydrophobic peptides. CoolTip also provided better quantitative reproducibility in LC/MS/MS analysis. We anticipate that this protocol will provide improved performance in many kinds of shotgun proteomics experiments.
PXD025360	34742300	Identification of Desmoglein-2 as a novel target of Helicobacter pylori HtrA in epithelial cells. 	Membrane substrates of HtrA from Helicobacter pylori	Desmoglein, Helicobacter pylori, HtrA, membrane, protease, substrate	BACKGROUND: High temperature requirement A (HtrA) is an active serine protease secreted by the group-I carcinogen Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The human cell adhesion protein and tumor suppressor E-cadherin (hCdh1) expressed on the surface of gastric epithelial cells was identified as the first HtrA substrate. HtrA-mediated hCdh1 cleavage and subsequent disruption of intercellular adhesions are considered as important steps in H. pylori pathogenesis. In this study, we performed a proteomic profiling of H. pylori HtrA (HpHtrA) to decipher the complex mechanism of H. pylori interference with the epithelial barrier integrity. RESULTS: Using a proteomic approach we identified human desmoglein-2 (hDsg2), neuropilin-1, ephrin-B2, and semaphorin-4D as novel extracellular HpHtrA substrates and confirmed the well characterized target hCdh1. HpHtrA-mediated hDsg2 cleavage was further analyzed by in vitro cleavage assays using recombinant proteins. In infection experiments, we demonstrated hDsg2 shedding from H. pylori-colonized MKN28 and NCI-N87 cells independently of pathogen-induced matrix-metalloproteases or ADAM10 and ADAM17. CONCLUSIONS: Characterizing the substrate specificity of HpHtrA revealed efficient hDsg2 cleavage underlining the importance of HpHtrA in opening intercellular junctions. Video Abstract.
PXD026508	34742736	The steroidal lactone withaferin A impedes T-cell motility by inhibiting the kinase ZAP70 and subsequent kinome signaling. 	Withaferin A inhibits LFA-1-stimulated ZAP70 activity and T-cell motility	T-lymphocytes, inflammation, kinome, migration, withaferin A	The steroidal lactone withaferin A (WFA) is a dietary phytochemical, derived from Withania somnifera. It exhibits a wide range of biological properties, including immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antistress, and anticancer activities. Here we investigated the effect of WFA on T-cell motility, which is crucial for adaptive immune responses as well as autoimmune reactions. We found that WFA dose-dependently (within the concentration range of 0.3-1.25 muM) inhibited the ability of human T-cells to migrate via cross-linking of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) integrin with its ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Coimmunoprecipitation of WFA interacting proteins and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry identified a WFA-interactome consisting of 273 proteins in motile T-cells. In particular, our data revealed significant enrichment of the zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) and cytoskeletal actin protein interaction networks upon stimulation. Phospho-peptide mapping and kinome analysis substantiated kinase signaling downstream of ZAP70 as a key WFA target, which was further confirmed by bait-pulldown and Western immunoblotting assays. The WFA-ZAP70 interaction was disrupted by a disulfide reducing agent dithiothreitol, suggesting an involvement of cysteine covalent binding interface. In silico docking predicted WFA binding to ZAP70 at cystine 560 and 564 residues. These findings provide a mechanistic insight whereby WFA binds to and inhibits the ZAP70 kinase and impedes T-cell motility. We therefore conclude that WFA may be exploited to pharmacologically control host immune responses and potentially prevent autoimmune-mediated pathologies.
PXD027153	34742849	The functionality of plant mechanoproteins (forisomes) is dependent on the dual role of conserved cysteine residues. 	Functionality of plant mechanoproteins is based on dual role of cysteines	Cysteins, Forisomes, MtSEO-F1, Redox, alkylation, disulfide bonds	Forisomes are giant polyprotein complexes that undergo reversible conformational rearrangements from a spindle-like to a plug-like state in response to Ca(2+) or changes in pH. They act as valves in the plant vasculature, and reproduce this function in vitro to regulate flow in microfluidic capillaries controlled by electro-titration. Heterologous expression in yeast or plants allows the large-scale production of tailor-made artificial forisomes for technical applications. Here we investigated the unexpected disintegration of artificial forisomes in response to Ca(2+) following the deletion of the M1 motif in the MtSEO-F1 protein or the replacement of all four conserved cysteine residues therein. This phenomenon could be mimicked in wild-type forisomes under reducing conditions by adding a thiol alkylating agent. We propose a model in which reversible changes in forisome structure depend on cysteine residues with ambiguous redox states, allowing the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges (confirmed by mass spectrometry) as well as noncovalent thiol interactions to connect forisome substructures in the dispersed state. This is facilitated by the projection of the M1 motif from the MtSEO-F1 protein as part of an extended loop. Our findings support the rational engineering of disintegrating forisomes to control the release of peptides or enzymes in microfluidic systems.
PXD021621	34742912	Hydroxyl radical footprinting analysis of a human haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex. 	Hydroxyl radical footprinting analysis of a human haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex	FPOP, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, footprinting, haptoglobin, hemoglobin, timsTOF Pro	Methods of structural mass spectrometry have become more popular to study protein structure and dynamics. Among them, fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) has several advantages such as irreversibility of modifications and more facile determination of the site of modification with single residue resolution. In the present study, FPOP analysis was applied to study the hemoglobin (Hb) - haptoglobin (Hp) complex allowing identification of respective regions altered upon the complex formation. FPOP footprinting using a timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer revealed structural information for 84 and 76 residues in Hp and Hb, respectively, including statistically significant differences in the modification extent below 0.3%. The most affected residues upon complex formation were Met76 and Tyr140 in Hbalpha, and Tyr280 and Trp284 in Hpbeta. The data allowed determination of amino acids directly involved in Hb - Hp interactions and those located outside of the interaction interface yet affected by the complex formation. Also, previously modeled interaction between Hb betaTrp37 and Hp betaPhe292 was not confirmed by our data. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD021621.
PXD028664	34746269	Investigation of Specific Proteins Related to Different Types of Coronary Atherosclerosis. 	Human heart atherosclerosis TMT	Heart, Plasma, TMT,PRM	Objective: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a complex disease caused by multifaceted interaction between genetic and environmental factors, which makes identification of the most likely disease candidate proteins and their associated risk markers a big challenge. Atherosclerosis is presented by a broad spectrum of heart diseases, including stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which is the progressive stage of SCAD. As such, the correct and prompt diagnosis of atherosclerosis turns into imperative for precise and prompt disease diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. Methods: The current work aims to look for specific protein markers for differential diagnosis of coronary atherosclerosis. Thirty male patients between 45 and 55 years diagnosed with atherosclerosis were analyzed by tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry. The study excluded those who were additionally diagnosed with hypertension and type 1 and 2 diabetes. The Mufuzz analysis was applied to select target proteins for precise and prompt diagnosis of atherosclerosis, most of which were most related to high lipid metabolism. The parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was used to verify the selected target proteins. Finally, The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was calculated by a random forest experiment. Results: One thousand one hundred and forty seven proteins were identified in the TMT mass spectrometry, 907 of which were quantifiable. In the PRM study, six proteins related to lipid metabolism pathway were selected for verification and they were ALB, SHBG, APOC2, APOC3, APOC4, SAA4. Conclusion: Through the detected specific changes in these six proteins, our results provide accuracy in atherosclerosis patients' diagnosis, especially in cases with varying types of the disease.
PXD024718	34746273	A Comprehensive Proteome and Acetyl-Proteome Atlas Reveals Molecular Mechanisms Adapting to the Physiological Changes From Pre-laying to Peak-Laying Stage in Liver of Hens (Gallus gallus). 	A comprehensive proteome and acetyl-proteome atlas from pre-laying to peak-laying stage in liver of hens (Gallus gallus)	Acetylated proteins, Energy demand, Laying, Lipid synthesis, Liver	Along with sexual maturity, the liver undergoes numerous metabolic processes to adapt the physiological changes associated with egg-laying in hens. However, mechanisms regulating the processes were unclear. In this study, comparative hepatic proteome and acetyl-proteome between pre- and peak-laying hens were performed. The results showed that the upregulated proteins were mainly related to lipid and protein biosynthesis, while the downregulated proteins were mainly involved in pyruvate metabolism and were capable of inhibiting gluconeogenesis and lactate synthesis in peak-laying hens compared with that in pre-laying hens. With unchanged expression level, the significant acetylated proteins were largely functioned on activation of polyunsaturated fatty acid oxidation in peroxisome, while the significant deacetylated proteins were principally used to elevate medium and short fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation. Most of the proteins which involved in gluconeogenesis, lipid transport, and detoxification were influenced by both protein expression and acetylation. Taken overall, a novel mechanism wherein an alternate source of acetyl coenzyme A was produced by activation of FA oxidation and pyruvate metabolism to meet the increased energy demand and lipid synthesis in liver of laying hens was uncovered. This study provides new insights into molecular mechanism of adaptation to physiological changes in liver of laying hens.
PXD024632	34746700	Conditions for maintenance of hepatocyte differentiation and function in 3D cultures. 	Conditions for maintenance of hepatocyte differentiation and function in 3D cultures	Primary Human Hepatocyte culture	Spheroid cultures of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) are used in studies of hepatic drug metabolism and toxicity. The cultures are maintained under different conditions, with possible confounding results. We performed an in-depth analysis of the influence of various culture conditions to find the optimal conditions for the maintenance of an in vivo like phenotype. The formation, protein expression, and function of PHH spheroids were followed for three weeks in a high-throughput 384-well format. Medium composition affected spheroid histology, global proteome profile, drug metabolism and drug-induced toxicity. No epithelial-mesenchymal transition was observed. Media with fasting glucose and insulin levels gave spheroids with phenotypes closest to normal PHH. The most expensive medium resulted in PHH features most divergent from that of native PHH. Our results provide a protocol for culture of healthy PHH with maintained function - a prerequisite for studies of hepatocyte homeostasis and more reproducible hepatocyte research.
PXD027084	34746707	Acetyl-CoA derived from hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation aggravates inflammation by enhancing p65 acetylation. 	acetylation modification of large yellow croaker	acetylation	Acetylation coordinates many biological processes to ensure cells respond appropriately to nutrients. However, how acetylation regulates lipid surplus-induced inflammation remains poorly understood. Here, we found that a high-fat diet (HFD) enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, which enhanced acetyl-CoA levels in the liver of the large yellow croaker. The HFD activated ACLY to govern the "citrate transport" to transfer acetyl-CoA from the mitochondria to the nucleus. Elevated acetyl-CoA activated CBP to increase p65 acetylation and then aggravated inflammation. SIRT1 was deactivated with a decline in NAD(+)/NADH, which further aggravated inflammation. Therefore, acetylation-dependent regulation of transcription factor activity is an adaptation to proinflammatory stimuli under nutrient stress, which was also confirmed in AML12 hepatocytes. In vitro octanoate stimulation further verified that acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid beta-oxidation mediated acetylation homeostasis in the nucleus. The broad therapeutic prospects of intermediate metabolites and acetyltransferases/deacetylases might provide critical insights for the treatment of metabolic diseases in vertebrates.
PXD026366	34747696	Rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection using quantitative peptide enrichment LC-MS analysis. 	Rapid and Sensitive Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Using Quantitative Peptide Enrichment Analysis	LC-MS, MRM, NCAP, RT-PCR, SARS-Cov-2, SISCAPA, affinity, digest, peptide	Reliable, robust, large-scale molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for monitoring the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We have developed a scalable analytical approach to detect viral proteins based on peptide immuno-affinity enrichment combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This is a multiplexed strategy, based on targeted proteomics analysis and read-out by LC-MS, capable of precisely quantifying and confirming the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) swab media from combined throat/nasopharynx/saliva samples. The results reveal that the levels of SARS-CoV-2 measured by LC-MS correlate well with their correspondingreal-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) read-out (r = 0.79). The analytical workflow shows similar turnaround times as regular RT-PCR instrumentation with a quantitative read-out of viral proteins corresponding to cycle thresholds (Ct) equivalents ranging from 21 to 34. Using RT-PCR as a reference, we demonstrate that the LC-MS-based method has 100% negative percent agreement (estimated specificity) and 95% positive percent agreement (estimated sensitivity) when analyzing clinical samples collected from asymptomatic individuals with a Ct within the limit of detection of the mass spectrometer (Ct <= 30). These results suggest that a scalable analytical method based on LC-MS has a place in future pandemic preparedness centers to complement current virus detection technologies.
PXD029348	34747980	Ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 localizes to peroxisomes to regulate pexophagy. 	MARCH5 interactome detection using PUP-IT	MARCH5, PUP-IT	Mitochondria and peroxisomes are independent but functionally closely related organelles. A few proteins have been characterized as dual-organelle locating proteins with distinct or similar roles on mitochondria and peroxisomes. MARCH5 is a mitochondria-associated ubiquitin ligase best known for its regulatory role in mitochondria quality control, fission, and fusion. Here, we used a proximity tagging system, PUP-IT, and identified new interacting proteins of MARCH5. Our data uncover that MARCH5 is a dual-organelle locating protein that interacts with several peroxisomal proteins. PEX19 binds the transmembrane region on MARCH5 and targets it to peroxisomes. On peroxisomes, MARCH5 binds and mediates the ubiquitination of PMP70. Furthermore, we find PMP70 ubiquitination and pexophagy induced by mTOR inhibition are blocked in the absence of MARCH5. Our study suggests novel roles of MARCH5 on peroxisomes.
PXD030648	34748352	Computational Optimization of Spectral Library Size Improves DIA-MS Proteome Coverage and Applications to 15 Tumors. 	Computational Optimization of Spectral Library Size Improves DIA-MS Proteome Coverage and Applications to 15 Tumors	DIA Spectral Library, Optimization	Efficient peptide and protein identifications from data-independent acquisition mass spectrometric (DIA-MS) data typically rely on a project-specific spectral library with a suitable size. Here, we describe subLib, a computational strategy for optimizing the spectral library for a specific DIA data set based on a comprehensive spectral library, requiring the preliminary analysis of the DIA data set. Compared with the pan-human library strategy, subLib achieved a 41.2% increase in peptide precursor identifications and a 35.6% increase in protein group identifications in a test data set of six colorectal tumor samples. We also applied this strategy to 389 carcinoma samples from 15 tumor data sets: up to a 39.2% increase in peptide precursor identifications and a 19.0% increase in protein group identifications were observed. Our strategy for spectral library size optimization thus successfully proved to deepen the proteome coverages of DIA-MS data.
PXD021149	34748613	Species-specific quantification of circulating ebolavirus burden using VP40-derived peptide variants. 	MS quantification of circulating CFP-10, p24 and VP40	MRM	Six ebolavirus species are reported to date, including human pathogens Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Tai Forest virus (TAFV); non-human pathogen Reston virus (RESTV); and the plausible Bombali virus (BOMV). Since there are differences in the disease severity caused by different species, species identification and viral burden quantification are critical for treating infected patients timely and effectively. Here we developed an immunoprecipitation-coupled mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assay for VP40 antigen detection and quantification. We carefully selected two regions of VP40, designated as peptide 8 and peptide12 from the protein sequence that showed minor variations among Ebolavirus species through MS analysis of tryptic peptides and antigenicity prediction based on available bioinformatic tools, and generated high-quality capture antibodies pan-specific for these variant peptides. We applied this assay to human plasma spiked with recombinant VP40 protein from EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV and virus-like particles (VLP), as well as EBOV infected NHP plasma. Sequence substitutions between EBOV and SUDV, the two species with highest lethality, produced affinity variations of 2.6-fold for p8 and 19-fold for p12. The proposed IP-MS assay differentiates four of the six known EBV species in one assay, through a combination of p8 and p12 data. The IP-MS assay limit of detection (LOD) using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) as signal readout was determined to be 28 ng/mL and 7 ng/mL for EBOV and SUDV respectively, equivalent to ~1.625-6.5x105 Geq/mL, and comparable to the LOD of lateral flow immunoassays currently used for Ebola surveillance. The two peptides of the IP-MS assay were also identified by their tandem MS spectra using a miniature MALDI-TOF MS instrument, greatly increasing the feasibility of high specificity assay in a decentralized laboratory.
PXD028742	34748728	Identification and characterization of a noncanonical menaquinone-linked formate dehydrogenase. 	Identification and characterization of Formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) from Bacillus subtilis	Bacillus subtilis, Bacteria, purification	The molybdenum/tungsten-bis-pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide family of formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) plays roles in several metabolic pathways ranging from carbon fixation to energy harvesting because of their reaction with a wide variety of redox partners. Indeed, this metabolic plasticity results from the diverse structures, cofactor content, and substrates used by partner subunits interacting with the catalytic hub. Here, we unveiled two noncanonical FDHs in Bacillus subtilis, which are organized into two-subunit complexes with unique features, ForCE1 and ForCE2. We show that the formate oxidoreductase catalytic subunit interacts with an unprecedented partner subunit, formate oxidoreductase essential subunit, and that its amino acid sequence within the active site deviates from the consensus residues typically associated with FDH activity, as a histidine residue is naturally substituted with a glutamine. The formate oxidoreductase essential subunit mediates the utilization of menaquinone as an electron acceptor as shown by the formate:menadione oxidoreductase activity of both enzymes, their copurification with menaquinone, and the distinctive detection of a protein-bound neutral menasemiquinone radical by multifrequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments on the purified enzymes. Moreover, EPR characterization of both FDHs reveals the presence of several [Fe-S] clusters with distinct relaxation properties and a weakly anisotropic Mo(V) EPR signature, consistent with the characteristic molybdenum/bis-pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor of this enzyme family. Altogether, this work enlarges our knowledge of the FDH family by identifying a noncanonical FDH, which differs in terms of architecture, amino acid conservation around the molybdenum cofactor, and reactivity.
PXD028512	34750370	Competitive binding and molecular crowding regulate the cytoplasmic interactome of non-viral polymeric gene delivery vectors. 	Competitive Binding and Molecular Crowding Regulate the Cytoplasmic Interactome of Non-Viral Polymeric Gene Delivery Vectors	Gene delivery, RNA delivery, cytosolic interactome, polycationic vector, polymer brush	In contrast to the processes controlling the complexation, targeting and uptake of polycationic gene delivery vectors, the molecular mechanisms regulating their cytoplasmic dissociation remains poorly understood. Upon cytosolic entry, vectors become exposed to a complex, concentrated mixture of molecules and biomacromolecules. In this report, we characterise the cytoplasmic interactome associated with polycationic vectors based on poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) and poly(2-methacrylolyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride) (PMETAC) brushes. To quantify the contribution of different classes of low molar mass molecules and biomacromolecules to RNA release, we develop a kinetics model based on competitive binding. Our results identify the importance of competition from highly charged biomacromolecules, such as cytosolic RNA, as a primary regulator of RNA release. Importantly, our data indicate the presence of ribosome associated proteins, proteins associated with translation and transcription factors that may underly a broader impact of polycationic vectors on translation. In addition, we bring evidence that molecular crowding modulates competitive binding and demonstrate how the modulation of such interactions, for example via quaternisation or the design of charge-shifting moieties, impacts on the long-term transfection efficiency of polycationic vectors. Understanding the mechanism regulating cytosolic dissociation will enable the improved design of cationic vectors for long term gene release and therapeutic efficacy.
PXD020812	34750429	Adipose MDM2 regulates systemic insulin sensitivity. 	Adipose MDM2 regulates systemic insulin sensitivity through nuclear import of MORC2 and the PPARgamma cofactor LIPIN1	C/EBP, LIPIN1, MDM2, MORC2, PPARgamma, obesity	The intimate association between obesity and type II diabetes urges for a deeper understanding of adipocyte function. We and others have previously delineated a role for the tumor suppressor p53 in adipocyte biology. Here, we show that mice haploinsufficient for MDM2, a key regulator of p53, in their adipose stores suffer from overt obesity, glucose intolerance, and hepatic steatosis. These mice had decreased levels of circulating palmitoleic acid [non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) 16:1] concomitant with impaired visceral adipose tissue expression of Scd1 and Ffar4. A similar decrease in Scd and Ffar4 expression was found in in vitro differentiated adipocytes with perturbed MDM2 expression. Lowered MDM2 levels led to nuclear exclusion of the transcriptional cofactors, MORC2 and LIPIN1, and thereby possibly hampered adipocyte function by antagonizing LIPIN1-mediated PPARgamma coactivation. Collectively, these data argue for a hitherto unknown interplay between MDM2 and MORC2/LIPIN1 involved in balancing adipocyte function.
PXD028557	34753942	Inability to switch from ARID1A-BAF to ARID1B-BAF impairs exit from pluripotency and commitment towards neural crest formation in ARID1B-related neurodevelopmental disorders. 	Inability to switch from ARID1A-BAF to ARID1B-BAF impairs exit from pluripotency and commitment towards neural crest formation in ARID1B-related neurodevelopmental disorders	ARID1A, ARID1B, BAF, CNCC, IP	Subunit switches in the BAF chromatin remodeler are essential during development. ARID1B and its paralog ARID1A encode for mutually exclusive BAF subunits. De novo ARID1B haploinsufficient mutations cause neurodevelopmental disorders, including Coffin-Siris syndrome, which is characterized by neurological and craniofacial features. Here, we leveraged ARID1B(+/-) Coffin-Siris patient-derived iPSCs and modeled cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) formation. We discovered that ARID1B is active only during the first stage of this process, coinciding with neuroectoderm specification, where it is part of a lineage-specific BAF configuration (ARID1B-BAF). ARID1B-BAF regulates exit from pluripotency and lineage commitment by attenuating thousands of enhancers and genes of the NANOG and SOX2 networks. In iPSCs, these enhancers are maintained active by ARID1A-containing BAF. At the onset of differentiation, cells transition from ARID1A- to ARID1B-BAF, eliciting attenuation of the NANOG/SOX2 networks and triggering pluripotency exit. Coffin-Siris patient cells fail to perform the ARID1A/ARID1B switch, and maintain ARID1A-BAF at the pluripotency enhancers throughout all stages of CNCC formation. This leads to persistent NANOG/SOX2 activity which impairs CNCC formation. Despite showing the typical neural crest signature (TFAP2A/SOX9-positive), ARID1B-haploinsufficient CNCCs are also aberrantly NANOG-positive. These findings suggest a connection between ARID1B mutations, neuroectoderm specification and a pathogenic mechanism for Coffin-Siris syndrome.
PXD027412	34756071	Japanese Encephalitis Virus NS1' Protein Interacts with Host CDK1 Protein to Regulate Antiviral Response. 	JEV NS1'-interacting cellular proteins	JEV NS1 HUMAN LC-MSMS	Type I interferon (IFN-I) is a key component of the host innate immune system. To establish efficient replication, viruses have developed several strategies to escape from the host IFN response. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) NS1', a larger NS1-related protein, is known to inhibit the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS)-mediated IFN-beta induction by increasing the binding of transcription factors (CREB and c-Rel) to the microRNA 22 (miRNA-22) promoter. However, the mechanism by which NS1' induces the recruitment of CREB and c-Rel onto the miRNA-22 promoter is unknown. Here, we found that JEV NS1' protein interacts with the host cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) protein. Mechanistically, NS1' interrupts the CDC25C phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation of CDK1, which prolongs the phosphorylation status of CDK1 and leads to the inhibition of MAVS-mediated IFN-beta induction. Furthermore, the CREB phosphorylation and c-Rel activation through the IkappaBalpha phosphorylation were observed to be enhanced upon the augmentation of CDK1 phosphorylation by NS1'. The abrogation of CDK1 activity by a small-molecule inhibitor significantly suppressed the JEV replication in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the administration of CDK1 inhibitor protected the wild-type mice from JEV-induced lethality but showed no effect on the MAVS(-/-) mice challenged with JEV. In conclusion, our study provides new insight into the mechanism of JEV immune evasion, which may lead to the development of novel therapeutic options to treat JEV infection. IMPORTANCE Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the main cause of acute human encephalitis in Asia. The unavailability of specific treatment for Japanese encephalitis demands a better understanding of the basic cellular mechanisms that contribute to the onset of disease. The present study identifies a novel interaction between the JEV NS1' protein and the cellular CDK1 protein, which facilitates the JEV replication by dampening the cellular antiviral response. This study sheds light on a novel mechanism of JEV replication, and thus our findings could be employed for developing new therapies against JEV infection.
PXD027490	34758314	Integrated genomic and proteomic analyses identify stimulus-dependent molecular changes associated with distinct modes of skeletal muscle atrophy. 	Induction of muscle atrophy by tumor and dexamethasone regulates a distinct set of proteins from atrophy caused by aging	aging, atrophy, cachexia, sarcopenia, skeletal muscle	Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating condition that occurs with aging and disease, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Previous work determined that common transcriptional changes occur in muscle during atrophy induced by different stimuli. However, whether this holds true at the proteome level remains largely unexplored. Here, we find that, contrary to this earlier model, distinct atrophic stimuli (corticosteroids, cancer cachexia, and aging) induce largely different mRNA and protein changes during muscle atrophy in mice. Moreover, there is widespread transcriptome-proteome disconnect. Consequently, atrophy markers (atrogenes) identified in earlier microarray-based studies do not emerge from proteomics as generally induced by atrophy. Rather, we identify proteins that are distinctly modulated by different types of atrophy (herein defined as "atroproteins") such as the myokine CCN1/Cyr61, which regulates myofiber type switching during sarcopenia. Altogether, these integrated analyses indicate that different catabolic stimuli induce muscle atrophy via largely distinct mechanisms.
PXD028546	34758328	Genomic expansion of Aldh1a1 protects beavers against high metabolic aldehydes from lipid oxidation. 	The genome of North American beaver provides insights into the mechanisms of its longevity and cancer resistance	aging, cancer, comparative biology, longevity	The North American beaver is an exceptionally long-lived and cancer-resistant rodent species. Here, we report the evolutionary changes in its gene coding sequences, copy numbers, and expression. We identify changes that likely increase its ability to detoxify aldehydes, enhance tumor suppression and DNA repair, and alter lipid metabolism, potentially contributing to its longevity and cancer resistance. Hpgd, a tumor suppressor gene, is uniquely duplicated in beavers among rodents, and several genes associated with tumor suppression and longevity are under positive selection in beavers. Lipid metabolism genes show positive selection signals, changes in copy numbers, or altered gene expression in beavers. Aldh1a1, encoding an enzyme for aldehydes detoxification, is particularly notable due to its massive expansion in beavers, which enhances their cellular resistance to ethanol and capacity to metabolize diverse aldehyde substrates from lipid oxidation and their woody diet. We hypothesize that the amplification of Aldh1a1 may contribute to the longevity of beavers.
PXD028394	34758356	Purification of an insect juvenile hormone receptor complex enables insights into its post-translational phosphorylation. 	LC-MSMS analyses of purified, recombinant TcJHR complexes	Juvenile Hormone Receptor, Tribolium castaneum	Juvenile hormone (JH) plays vital roles in insect reproduction, development, and in many aspects of physiology. JH primarily acts at the gene-regulatory level through interaction with an intracellular receptor (JH receptor [JHR]), a ligand-activated complex of transcription factors consisting of the JH-binding protein methoprene-tolerant (MET) and its partner taiman (TAI). Initial studies indicated significance of post-transcriptional phosphorylation, subunit assembly, and nucleocytoplasmic transport of JHR in JH signaling. However, our knowledge of JHR regulation at the protein level remains rudimentary, partly because of the difficulty of obtaining purified and functional JHR proteins. Here, we present a method for high-yield expression and purification of JHR complexes from two insect species, the beetle T. castaneum and the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Recombinant JHR subunits from each species were coexpressed in an insect cell line using a baculovirus system. MET-TAI complexes were purified through affinity chromatography and anion exchange columns to yield proteins capable of binding both the hormonal ligand (JH III) and DNA bearing cognate JH-response elements. We further examined the beetle JHR complex in greater detail. Biochemical analyses and MS confirmed that T. castaneum JHR was a 1:1 heterodimer consisting of MET and Taiman proteins, stabilized by the JHR agonist ligand methoprene. Phosphoproteomics uncovered multiple phosphorylation sites in the MET protein, some of which were induced by methoprene treatment. Finally, we report a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal, straddled by phosphorylated residues, within the disordered C-terminal region of MET. Our present characterization of the recombinant JHR is an initial step toward understanding JHR structure and function.
PXD026445	34758830	First comprehensive proteome analysis of lysine crotonylation in Streptococcus agalactiae, a pathogen causing meningoencephalitis in teleosts. 	First comprehensive proteome analysis of lysine crotonylation in Streptococcus agalactiae, a pathogen causing meningoencephalitis in teleosts	Streptococcus agalactiae, crotonylation, virulence factors	BACKGROUD: Streptococcus agalactiae is a common colonizer of the rectovaginal tract and lead to infectious diseases of neonatal and non-pregnant adults, which also causes infectious disease in fish and a zoonotic risk as well. Lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a kind of histone post-translational modifications discovered in 2011. In yeast and mammals, Kcr function as potential enhancers and promote gene expression. However, lysine crotonylation in S. agalactiae has not been studied yet. METHODS: In this study, the crotonylation profiling of fish pathogen, S. agalactiae was investigated by combining affinity enrichment with LC MS/MS. The Kcr modification of several selected proteins were further validated by Western blotting. RESULTS: In the present study, we conducted the proteome-wide profiling of Kcr in S. agalactiae and identified 241 Kcr sites from 675 screened proteins for the first time. Bioinformatics analysis showed that 164 sequences were matched to a total of six definitively conserved motifs, and many of them were significantly enriched in metabolic processes, cellular process, and single-organism processes. Moreover, four crotonylation modified proteins were predicted as virulence factors or to being part of the quorum sensing system PTMs on bacteria. The data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026445. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a promising starting point for further functional research of crotonylation in bacterial virulence in S. agalactiae.
PXD025638	34758889	A fiber-deprived diet causes cognitive impairment and hippocampal microglia-mediated synaptic loss through the gut microbiota and metabolites. 	Dietary fiber deficiency promotes cognitive impairment through the gut-hippocampal axis	hippocampus	BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment, an increasing mental health issue, is a core feature of the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases. Industrialized nations especially, have experienced a marked decrease in dietary fiber intake, but the potential mechanism linking low fiber intake and cognitive impairment is poorly understood. Emerging research reported that the diversity of gut microbiota in Western populations is significantly reduced. However, it is unknown whether a fiber-deficient diet (which alters gut microbiota) could impair cognition and brain functional elements through the gut-brain axis. RESULTS: In this study, a mouse model of long-term (15 weeks) dietary fiber deficiency (FD) was used to mimic a sustained low fiber intake in humans. We found that FD mice showed impaired cognition, including deficits in object location memory, temporal order memory, and the ability to perform daily living activities. The hippocampal synaptic ultrastructure was damaged in FD mice, characterized by widened synaptic clefts and thinned postsynaptic densities. A hippocampal proteomic analysis further identified a deficit of CaMKIId and its associated synaptic proteins (including GAP43 and SV2C) in the FD mice, along with neuroinflammation and microglial engulfment of synapses. The FD mice also exhibited gut microbiota dysbiosis (decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Proteobacteria), which was significantly associated with the cognitive deficits. Of note, a rapid differentiating microbiota change was observed in the mice with a short-term FD diet (7 days) before cognitive impairment, highlighting a possible causal impact of the gut microbiota profile on cognitive outcomes. Moreover, the FD diet compromised the intestinal barrier and reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. We exploit these findings for SCFA receptor knockout mice and oral SCFA supplementation that verified SCFA playing a critical role linking the altered gut microbiota and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: This study, for the first time, reports that a fiber-deprived diet leads to cognitive impairment through altering the gut microbiota-hippocampal axis, which is pathologically distinct from normal brain aging. These findings alert the adverse impact of dietary fiber deficiency on brain function, and highlight an increase in fiber intake as a nutritional strategy to reduce the risk of developing diet-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

PXD016333	34758895	Comparative proteomic analysis of Leishmania parasites isolated from visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis patients. 	Comparative proteomic analysis of Leishmania parasite isolates obtained from visceral and cutaneous leishmaniases patients	Shotgun proteomics, leishmania, leishmania infantum, leishmania tropica, leishmaniasis, neglected tropical disease, parasite, sandfly	Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease in which different clinical manifestations are classified into three primary forms: visceral, cutaneous and mucocutaneous. These disease forms are associated with parasite species of the protozoan genus Leishmania. For instance, Leishmania infantum and Leishmania tropica are typically linked with visceral (VL) and cutaneous (CL) leishmaniasis, respectively; however, these two species can also cause other form to a lesser extent. What is more alarming is this characteristic, which threatens current medical diagnosis and treatment, is started to be acquired by other species. Our purpose was to address this issue; therefore, gel-based and gel-free proteomic analyses were carried out on the species L. infantum to determine the proteins differentiating between the parasites caused VL and CL. In addition, L. tropica parasites representing the typical cases for CL were included. According to our results, electrophoresis gels of parasites caused to VL were distinguishable regarding the repetitive down-regulation on some specific locations. In addition, a distinct spot of an antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase, was shown up only on the gels of CL samples regardless of the species. In the gel-free approach, 37 proteins that were verified with a second database search using a different search engine, were recognized from the comparison between VL and CL samples. Among them, 31 proteins for the CL group and six proteins for the VL group were determined differentially abundant. Two proteins from the gel-based analysis, pyruvate kinase and succinyl-coA:3-ketoacid-coenzyme A transferase analysis were encountered in the protein list of the CL group.
PXD028863	34759263	PURPL represses autophagic cell death to promote cutaneous melanoma by modulating ULK1 phosphorylation. 	Mass spectrometry (MS) datasets of PURPL RNA pulldown samples in A375 cells	human  A375 cells LC-MS	Uncontrolled overactivation of autophagy may lead to autophagic cell death, suppression of which is a pro-survival strategy for tumors. However, mechanisms involving key regulators in modulating autophagic cell death remain poorly defined. Here, we report a novel long noncoding RNA, p53 upregulated regulator of p53 levels (PURPL), functions as an oncogene to promote cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasiveness, and inhibits cell death in melanoma cells. Mechanistic studies showed that PURPL promoted mTOR-mediated ULK1 phosphorylation at Ser757 by physical interacting with mTOR and ULK1 to constrain autophagic response to avoid cell death. Loss of PURPL led to AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser555 and Ser317 to over-activate autophagy and induce autophagic cell death. Our results identify PURPL as a key regulator to modulate the activity of autophagy initiation factor ULK1 to repress autophagic cell death in melanoma and may represent a potential intervention target for melanoma therapy.
PXD025362	34759827	Venomics of the Enigmatic Andaman Cobra (Naja sagittifera) and the Preclinical Failure of Indian Antivenoms in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 	To the islands their own: Venomics of the enigmatic Andaman cobra (N. sagittifera) and the preclinical failure of Indian antivenoms in Andaman and Nicobar Islands	Indian antivenoms, Naja naja, Naja sagittifera	The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are an abode to a diversity of flora and fauna, including the many endemic species of snakes, such as the elusive Andaman cobra (Naja sagittifera). However, the ecology and evolution of venomous snakes inhabiting these islands have remained entirely uninvestigated. This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating the evolutionary history of N. sagittifera and its venom proteomic, biochemical and toxicity profile. Phylogenetic reconstructions confirmed the close relationship between N. sagittifera and the Southeast Asian monocellate cobra (N. kaouthia). Overlooking this evolutionary history, a polyvalent antivenom manufactured using the venom of the spectacled cobra (N. naja) from mainland India is used for treating N. sagittifera envenomations. Comparative evaluation of venoms of these congeners revealed significant differences in their composition, functions and potencies. Given the close phylogenetic relatedness between N. sagittifera and N. kaouthia, we further assessed the cross-neutralising efficacy of Thai monovalent N. kaouthia antivenom against N. sagittifera venoms. Our findings revealed the inadequate preclinical performance of the Indian polyvalent and Thai monovalent antivenoms in neutralising N. sagittifera venoms. Moreover, the poor efficacy of the polyvalent antivenom against N. naja venom from southern India further revealed the critical need to manufacture region-specific Indian antivenoms.
PXD021315	34759942	Label-Free Quantitative Proteome Analysis Reveals the Underlying Mechanisms of Grain Nuclear Proteins Involved in Wheat Water-Deficit Response. 	Label-free quantitative proteome analysis reveals the underlying mechanisms of grain nuclear proteins involved in wheat water-deficit response	Developing grains, Label-free quantitation., Nuclear proteome, Water deficit, Wheat	In this study, we performed the first nuclear proteome analysis of wheat developing grains under water deficit by using a label-free based quantitative proteomic approach. In total, we identified 625 unique proteins as differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs), of which 398 DAPs were predicted to be localized in nucleus. Under water deficit, 146 DAPs were up-regulated and mainly involved in the stress response and oxidation-reduction process, while 252 were down-regulated and mainly participated in translation, the cellular amino metabolic process, and the oxidation-reduction process. The cis-acting elements analysis of the key nuclear DAPs encoding genes demonstrated that most of these genes contained the same cis-acting elements in the promoter region, mainly including ABRE involved in abscisic acid response, antioxidant response element, MYB responsive to drought regulation and MYC responsive to early drought. The cis-acting elements related to environmental stress and hormones response were relatively abundant. The transcription expression profiling of the nuclear up-regulated DAPs encoding genes under different organs, developmental stages and abiotic stresses was further detected by RNA-seq and Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and more than 50% of these genes showed consistency between transcription and translation expression. Finally, we proposed a putative synergistic responsive network of wheat nuclear proteome to water deficit, revealing the underlying mechanisms of wheat grain nuclear proteome in response to water deficit.
PXD028382	34760200	Late-stage modification of peptides and proteins at cysteine with diaryliodonium salts. 	Late-stage modification of peptides and proteins at cysteine with diaryliodonium salts	H2A, modification, synthesis	The modification of peptides and proteins has emerged as a powerful means to efficiently prepare high value bioconjugates for a range of applications in chemical biology and for the development of next-generation therapeutics. Herein, we report a novel method for the chemoselective late-stage modification of peptides and proteins at cysteine in aqueous buffer with suitably functionalised diaryliodonium salts, furnishing stable thioether-linked synthetic conjugates. The power of this new platform is showcased through the late-stage modification of the affibody zEGFR and the histone protein H2A.
PXD026282	34761196	Nano-structured myelin: new nanovesicles for targeted delivery to white matter and microglia, from brain-to-brain. 	Myelin nanovesicles characterization	Orbitrap Fusion, nanoLC	Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide and the presence of various physiological barriers limits the accessibility to the brain and reduces the efficacy of various therapies. Moreover, new carriers having targeting properties to specific brain regions and cells are needed in order to improve therapies for the brain disorder treatment. In this study, for the first time, Myelin nanoVesicles (hereafter defined MyVes) from brain-extracted myelin were produced. The MyVes have an average diameter of 100-150 nm, negative zeta potential, spheroidal morphology, and contain lipids and the key proteins of the myelin sheath. Furthermore, they exhibit good cytocompatibility. The MyVes were able to target the white matter and interact mainly with the microglia cells. The preliminary results here presented allow us to suppose the employment of MyVes as potential carrier to target the white matter and microglia in order to counteract white matter microglia-related diseases.
PXD027783	34762162	Iminodiacetic acid (IDA)-generated mesoporous nanopolymer: a template to relate surface area, hydrophilicity, and glycopeptides enrichment. 	IDA (Iminodiacetic Acid) Generated Mesoporous Nanopolymer - A Template to Relate Surface Area, Hydrophilicity and Glycopeptides Enrichment	SPE, enrichment, glycopeptides, polymer	A three-step strategy is introduced to develop inherent iminodiacetic (IDA)-functionalized nanopolymer. SEM micrographs show homogenous spherical beads with a particle size of 500 nm. Further modification to COOH-functionalized 1,2-epoxy-5-hexene/DVB mesoporous nanopolymer enriches glycopeptides via hydrophilic interactions followed by their MS determination. Significantly high BET surface area 433.4336 m(2) g(-1) contributes to the improved surface hydrophilicity which is also shown by high concentration of ionizable carboxylic acids, 14.59 +/- 0.25 mmol g(-1). Measured surface area is the highest among DVB-based polymers and in general much higher in comparison to the previously reported BET surface areas of co-polymers, terpolymers, MOFs, and graphene-based composites. Thirty-one, 19, and 16 N-glycopeptides are enriched/identified by nanopolymer beads from tryptic digests of immunoglobulin G, horseradish peroxidase, and chicken avidin, respectively, without additional desalting steps. Material exhibits high selectivity (1:400 IgG:BSA), sensitivity (down to 0.1 fmol), regeneration ability up to three cycles, and batch-to-batch reproducibility (RSD > 1%). Furthermore, from 1 muL of digested human serum, 343 N-glycopeptide characteristics of 134 glycoproteins including 30 FDA-approved serum biomarkers are identified via nano-LC-MS/MS. The developed strategy to self-generate IDA on polymeric surface with improved surface area, porosity, and ordered morphology is insignia of its potential as chromatographic tool contributing to future developments in large-scale biomedical glycoproteomics studies.
PXD026550	34762230	Generation and Release of Neurogranin, Vimentin, and MBP Proteolytic Peptides, Following Traumatic Brain Injury. 	GFAP and MBP peptides in Traumatic Brain Injury	GFAP MBP	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major neurological disorder without FDA-approved therapies. In this study, we have examined the concept that TBI might trigger global brain proteolysis in the acute post-injury phase. Thus, we conducted a systemic proteolytic peptidomics analysis using acute cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from TBI patients and normal control samples. We employed ultrafiltration-based low molecular weight (LMW; < 10 kDa) peptide enrichment, coupled with nano-reversed-phase liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis, followed with orthogonal quantitative immunoblotting-based protein degradation analysis. We indeed identified novel patterns of injury-dependent proteolytic peptides derived from neuronal components (pre- and post-synaptic terminal, dendrites, axons), extracellular matrix, oligodendrocytes, microglial cells, and astrocytes. Among these, post-synaptic protein neurogranin was identified for the first time converted to neurogranin peptides including neurogranin peptide (aa 16-64) that is phosphorylated at Ser-36/48 (P-NG-fragment) in acute human TBI CSF samples vs. normal control with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.957. We also identified detailed processing of astroglia protein (vimentin) and oligodendrocyte protein (MBP and Golli-MBP) to protein breakdown products (BDPs) and/or LMW proteolytic peptides after TBI. In addition, using MS/MS selected reaction monitoring method, two C-terminally released MBP peptides TQDENPVVHFF and TQDENPVVHF were found to be elevated in acute and subacute TBI CSF samples as compared to their normal control counterparts. These findings imply that future therapeutic strategies might be placed on the suppression of brain proteolysis as a target. The endogenous proteolytic peptides discovered in human TBI biofluid could represent useful diagnostic and monitoring tools for TBI.
PXD024905	34762820	AtpTheta is an inhibitor of F0F1 ATP synthase to arrest ATP hydrolysis during low-energy conditions in cyanobacteria. 	Pull-down assay to identify proteins interacting with the small protein AtpÎ˜ (Norf1) in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803	F0F1 ATP synthase, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, protein pull-down, small protein AtpÎ˜	Biological processes in all living cells are powered by ATP, a nearly universal molecule of energy transfer. ATP synthases produce ATP utilizing proton gradients that are usually generated by either respiration or photosynthesis. However, cyanobacteria are unique in combining photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains in the same membrane system, the thylakoids. How cyanobacteria prevent the futile reverse operation of ATP synthase under unfavorable conditions pumping protons while hydrolyzing ATP is mostly unclear. Here, we provide evidence that the small protein AtpTheta, which is widely conserved in cyanobacteria, is mainly fulfilling this task. The expression of AtpTheta becomes induced under conditions such as darkness or heat shock, which can lead to a weakening of the proton gradient. Translational fusions of AtpTheta to the green fluorescent protein revealed targeting to the thylakoid membrane. Immunoprecipitation assays followed by mass spectrometry and far western blots identified subunits of ATP synthase as interacting partners of AtpTheta. ATP hydrolysis assays with isolated membrane fractions, as well as purified ATP synthase complexes, demonstrated that AtpTheta inhibits ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner similar to the F0F1-ATP synthase inhibitor N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodimide. The results show that, even in a well-investigated process, crucial new players can be discovered if small proteins are taken into consideration and indicate that ATP synthase activity can be controlled in surprisingly different ways.
PXD027545	34763061	Proteomic Analysis of Trichomonas vaginalis Phagolysosome, Lysosomal Targeting, and Unconventional Secretion of Cysteine Peptidases. 	Proteomic analysis of Trichomonas vaginalis phagolysosome, lysosomal targeting, and unconventional secretion of cysteine peptidases	Trichomonas vaginalis, cysteine peptidase, glycosylation, mannose-6-phosphate receptor, phagolysosome	The lysosome represents a central degradative compartment of eukaryote cells, yet little is known about the biogenesis and function of this organelle in parasitic protists. Whereas the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P)-dependent system is dominant for lysosomal targeting in metazoans, oligosaccharide-independent sorting has been reported in other eukaryotes. In this study, we investigated the phagolysosomal proteome of the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, its protein targeting and the involvement of lysosomes in hydrolase secretion. The organelles were purified using Percoll and OptiPrep gradient centrifugation and a novel purification protocol based on the phagocytosis of lactoferrin-covered magnetic nanoparticles. The analysis resulted in a lysosomal proteome of 462 proteins, which were sorted into 21 classes. Hydrolases represented the largest functional class and included proteases, lipases, phosphatases, and glycosidases. Identification of a large set of proteins involved in vesicular trafficking (80) and turnover of actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (29) indicate a dynamic phagolysosomal compartment. Several cysteine proteases such as TvCP2 were previously shown to be secreted. Our experiments showed that secretion of TvCP2 was strongly inhibited by chloroquine, which increases intralysosomal pH, thus indicating that TvCP2 secretion occurs through lysosomes rather than the classical secretory pathway. Unexpectedly, we identified divergent homologues of the M6P receptor TvMPR in the phagolysosomal proteome, although T. vaginalis lacks enzymes for M6P formation. To test whether oligosaccharides are involved in lysosomal targeting, we selected the lysosome-resident cysteine protease CLCP, which possesses two glycosylation sites. Mutation of any of the sites redirected CLCP to the secretory pathway. Similarly, the introduction of glycosylation sites to secreted beta-amylase redirected this protein to lysosomes. Thus, unlike other parasitic protists, T. vaginalis seems to utilize glycosylation as a recognition marker for lysosomal hydrolases. Our findings provide the first insight into the complexity of T. vaginalis phagolysosomes, their biogenesis, and role in the unconventional secretion of cysteine peptidases.
PXD024048	34763062	The Ubiquitin Interacting Motif-Like Domain of Met4 Selectively Binds K48 Polyubiquitin Chains. 	UIM domain interacting proteins	IP, UIM	Protein ubiquitylation is an important posttranslational modification that governs most cellular processes. Signaling functions of ubiquitylation are very diverse and involve proteolytic as well as nonproteolytic events, such as localization, regulation of protein interactions, and control of protein activity. The intricacy of ubiquitin signaling is further complicated by several different polyubiquitin chain types that are likely recognized and interpreted by different protein readers. For example, K48-linked ubiquitin chains represent the most abundant chain topology and are the canonical degradation signals, but have been implicated in degradation-independent functions as well, likely requiring a variety of protein readers. Ubiquitin binding domains that interact with polyubiquitin chains are likely at the center of ubiquitin signal recognition and transmission, but their structure and selectivity are largely unexplored. Here we report identification and characterization of the ubiquitin interacting motif-like (UIML) domain of the yeast transcription factor Met4 as a strictly K48-polyubiquitin specific binding unit using methods such as biolayer interferometry (BLI), pull-down assays, and mass spectrometry. We further used the selective binding property to develop an affinity probe for purification of proteins modified with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. The affinity probe has a Kd = 100 nM for K48 tetra-ubiquitin and shows no detectable interaction with either monoubiquitin or any other polyubiquitin chain configuration. Our results define a short strictly K48-linkage-dependent binding motif and present a new affinity reagent for the K48-polyubiquitin-modified proteome. Our findings benefit the ubiquitin field in analyses of the role of K48-linked polyubiquitylation and increase our understanding of chain topology selective ubiquitin chain recognition.
PXD018400	34763095	A metaproteomic-based gut microbiota profiling in children affected by autism spectrum disorders. 	Metaproteomics investigation on the gut microbiota of children affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder 	Human Gut Microbiota	During the last decade, the evidences on the relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and the microbial communities of the intestinal tract have considerably grown. Particularly, the role of gut microbiota (GM) ecology and predicted functions in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) has been especially investigated by 16S rRNA targeted and shotgun metagenomics, trying to assess disease signature and their correlation with cognitive impairment or gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations of the disease. Herein we present a metaproteomic approach to point out the microbial gene expression profiles, their functional annotations, and the taxonomic distribution of gut microbial communities in ASD children. We pursued a LC-MS/MS based investigation, to compare the GM profiles of patients with those of their respective relatives and aged-matched controls, providing a quantitative evaluation of bacterial metaproteins by SWATH analysis. All data were managed by a multiple step bioinformatic pipeline, including network analysis. In particular, comparing ASD subjects with CTRLs, up-regulation was found for some metaproteins associated with Clostridia and with carbohydrate metabolism (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and glutamate dehydrogenases), while down-regulation was observed for others associated with Bacteroidia (SusC and SusD family together with the TonB dependent receptor). Moreover, network analysis highlighted specific microbial correlations among ASD subgroups characterized by different functioning levels and GI symptoms. SIGNIFICANCE: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first metaproteomic investigation on the gut microbiota of ASD children compared with relatives and age-matched CTRLs. Remarkably, the applied SWATH methodology allowed the attribution of differentially regulated functions to specific microbial taxa, offering a novel and complementary point of view with respect to previous studies.
PXD020738	34763597	An integrated workflow for enhanced taxonomic and functional coverage of the mouse fecal metaproteome. 	A Metaproteomic Workflow for Sample Preparation and Data Analysis Applied to Mouse Faeces: 2	Metagenome, Metaproteomics, Mus musculus, Taxonomy	Intestinal microbiota plays a key role in shaping host homeostasis by regulating metabolism, immune responses and behavior. Its dysregulation has been associated with metabolic, immune and neuropsychiatric disorders and is accompanied by changes in bacterial metabolic regulation. Although proteomics is well suited for analysis of individual microbes, metaproteomics of fecal samples is challenging due to the physical structure of the sample, presence of contaminating host proteins and coexistence of hundreds of taxa. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus regarding preparation of fecal samples, as well as downstream bioinformatic analyses following metaproteomics data acquisition. Here we assess sample preparation and data analysis strategies applied to mouse feces in a typical mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic experiment. We show that subtle changes in sample preparation protocols may influence interpretation of biological findings. Two-step database search strategies led to significant underestimation of false positive protein identifications. Unipept software provided the highest sensitivity and specificity in taxonomic annotation of the identified peptides of unknown origin. Comparison of matching metaproteome and metagenome data revealed a positive correlation between protein and gene abundances. Notably, nearly all functional categories of detected protein groups were differentially abundant in the metaproteome compared to what would be expected from the metagenome, highlighting the need to perform metaproteomics when studying complex microbiome samples.
PXD023674	34764236	Targeted therapy for LIMD1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer subtypes. 	Targeted therapy for LIMD1-deficient non-small cell lung cancer subtypes:  a Proof-of-Concept synthetic lethal study	LIMD1, Lung Cancer, NSCLC, Synthetic Lethality, Tumour suppressor, targeted therapy	An early event in lung oncogenesis is loss of the tumour suppressor gene LIMD1 (LIM domains containing 1); this encodes a scaffold protein, which suppresses tumorigenesis via a number of different mechanisms. Approximately 45% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are deficient in LIMD1, yet this subtype of NSCLC has been overlooked in preclinical and clinical investigations. Defining therapeutic targets in these LIMD1 loss-of-function patients is difficult due to a lack of 'druggable' targets, thus alternative approaches are required. To this end, we performed the first drug repurposing screen to identify compounds that confer synthetic lethality with LIMD1 loss in NSCLC cells. PF-477736 was shown to selectively target LIMD1-deficient cells in vitro through inhibition of multiple kinases, inducing cell death via apoptosis. Furthermore, PF-477736 was effective in treating LIMD1(-/-) tumours in subcutaneous xenograft models, with no significant effect in LIMD1(+/+) cells. We have identified a novel drug tool with significant preclinical characterisation that serves as an excellent candidate to explore and define LIMD1-deficient cancers as a new therapeutic subgroup of critical unmet need.
PXD028077	34764337	Increased carvone production in Escherichia coli by balancing limonene conversion enzyme expression via targeted quantification concatamer proteome analysis. 	Increased carvone production in Escherichia coli by balancing limonene conversion enzyme expression via targeted quantification concatamer proteome analysis	Escherichia coli, QconCAT	(-)-Carvone is a monoterpenoid with a spearmint flavor. A sustainable biotechnological production process for (-)-carvone is desirable. Although all enzymes in (-)-carvone biosynthesis have been functionally expressed in Escherichia coli independently, the yield was low in previous studies. When cytochrome P450 limonene-6-hydroxylase (P450)/cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and carveol dehydrogenase (CDH) were expressed in a single strain, by-product formation (dihydrocarveol and dihydrocarvone) was detected. We hypothesized that P450 and CDH expression levels differ in E. coli. Thus, two strains independently expressing P450/CPR and CDH were mixed with different ratios, confirming increased carvone production and decreased by-product formation when CDH input was reduced. The optimum ratio of enzyme expression to maximize (-)-carvone production was determined using the proteome analysis quantification concatamer (QconCAT) method. Thereafter, a single strain expressing both P450/CPR and CDH was constructed to imitate the optimum expression ratio. The upgraded strain showed a 15-fold improvement compared to the initial strain, showing a 44 +/- 6.3 mg/L (-)-carvone production from 100 mg/L (-)-limonene. Our study showed the usefulness of the QconCAT proteome analysis method for strain development in the industrial biotechnology field.
PXD043806	34767452	Global ubiquitylation analysis of mitochondria in primary neurons identifies endogenous Parkin targets following activation of PINK1. 	CURTAIN - A Unique Web-based tool for exploration and sharing of MS-based proteomics data	Bioinformatics, BromoTAG, PTM	How activation of PINK1 and Parkin leads to elimination of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy is largely based on cell lines with few studies in neurons. Here, we have undertaken proteomic analysis of mitochondria from mouse neurons to identify ubiquitylated substrates of endogenous Parkin. Comparative analysis with human iNeuron datasets revealed a subset of 49 PINK1 activation-dependent diGLY sites in 22 proteins conserved across mouse and human systems. We use reconstitution assays to demonstrate direct ubiquitylation by Parkin in vitro. We also identified a subset of cytoplasmic proteins recruited to mitochondria that undergo PINK1 and Parkin independent ubiquitylation, indicating the presence of alternate ubiquitin E3 ligase pathways that are activated by mitochondrial depolarization in neurons. Last, we have developed an online resource to search for ubiquitin sites and enzymes in mitochondria of neurons, MitoNUb. These findings will aid future studies to understand Parkin activation in neuronal subtypes.
PXD028796	34767636	Raptor is critical for increasing the mitochondrial proteome and skeletal muscle force during hypertrophy. 	Raptor and rapamycin dependent proteomic changes in Akt overexpressing skeletal muscle	Akt, Raptor, mTOR, skeletal muscle	Loss of skeletal muscle mass and force is of critical importance in numerous pathologies, like age-related sarcopenia or cancer. It has been shown that the Akt-mTORC1 pathway is critical for stimulating adult muscle mass and function, however, it is unknown if mTORC1 is the only mediator downstream of Akt and which intracellular processes are required for functional muscle growth. Here, we show that loss of Raptor reduces muscle hypertrophy after Akt activation and completely prevents increases in muscle force. Interestingly, the residual hypertrophy after Raptor deletion can be completely prevented by administration of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Using a quantitative proteomics approach we find that loss of Raptor affects the increases in mitochondrial proteins, while rapamycin mainly affects ribosomal proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that mTORC1 is the key mediator of Akt-dependent muscle growth and its regulation of the mitochondrial proteome is critical for increasing muscle force.
PXD023915	34768447	Potential Muscle-Related Biomarkers in Predicting Curve Progression to the Surgical Threshold in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis-A Pilot Proteomic Study Comparing Four Non-Progressive vs. Four Progressive Patients vs. A Control Cohort. 	iTRAQ quantitative analysis for AIS study	AIS, iTRAQ, plasma	Previous studies have reported abnormal muscle morphology and functions in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). To answer whether such abnormalities could be reflected in their circulation and their clinical implication for predicting curve progression to the surgical threshold, this preliminary study explored the presence of baseline muscle-related proteins and their association with curve progression. Plasma samples were collected at the first clinical visit for AIS, with patients divided into non-progressive or progressive groups (N = four and four) according to their Cobb angle in six-year follow-ups, with age- and sex-matched healthy subjects (N = 50). Then, the samples were subjected to isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) for global comparison of untargeted protein expression. Seventy-one differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found elevated in progressive AIS. Functional analysis showed that 18 of these are expressed in muscles and play an essential role in muscle activities. Among the muscle-related DEPs, alpha-actin had the highest fold change in progressive/non-progressive groups. This preliminary study firstly suggested higher circulating levels of muscle structural proteins in progressive AIS, indicating the likelihood of structural damage at the microscopic level and its association with progression to the surgical threshold. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate these novel candidates for early diagnosis and predicting progression.
PXD028154	34768929	Proteomic Landscape of Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)-Producing HEK293 Cells. 	Proteome Analysis of AAV producing HEK293 cells	AAV, HEK293, gene therapy, label free	Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are widely used for gene therapy, providing treatment for diseases caused by absent or defective genes. Despite the success of gene therapy, AAV manufacturing is still challenging, with production yields being limited. With increased patient demand, improvements in host cell productivity through various engineering strategies will be necessary. Here, we study the host cell proteome of AAV5-producing HEK293 cells using reversed phase nano-liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS/MS). Relative label-free quantitation (LFQ) was performed, allowing a comparison of transfected vs. untransfected cells. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis revealed differential expression of proteins involved in fundamental cellular processes such as metabolism, proliferation, and cell death. Furthermore, changes in expression of proteins involved in endocytosis and lysosomal degradation were observed. Our data provides highly valuable insights into cellular mechanisms involved during recombinant AAV production by HEK293 cells, thus potentially enabling further improvements of gene therapy product manufacturing.
PXD020547	34769186	Protein Palmitoylation in Bovine Ovarian Follicle. 	Palmitoylated proteins in bovine granulosa cells	Bovine, granulosa cells, palmitoylation	Protein palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification by fatty acids (FA), mainly a palmitate (C16:0). Palmitoylation allows protein shuttling between the plasma membrane and cytosol to regulate protein stability, sorting and signaling activity and its deficiency leads to diseases. We aimed to characterize the palmitoyl-proteome of ovarian follicular cells and molecular machinery regulating protein palmitoylation within the follicle. For the first time, 84 palmitoylated proteins were identified from bovine granulosa cells (GC), cumulus cells (CC) and oocytes by acyl-biotin exchange proteomics. Of these, 32 were transmembrane proteins and 27 proteins were detected in bovine follicular fluid extracellular vesicles (ffEVs). Expression of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation enzymes as palmitoyltransferases (ZDHHCs), acylthioesterases (LYPLA1 and LYPLA2) and palmitoylthioesterases (PPT1 and PPT2) were analysed using transcriptome and proteome data in oocytes, CC and GC. By immunofluorescence, ZDHHC16, PPT1, PPT2 and LYPLA2 proteins were localized in GC, CC and oocyte. In oocyte and CC, abundance of palmitoylation-related enzymes significantly varied during oocyte maturation. These variations and the involvement of identified palmitoyl-proteins in oxidation-reduction processes, energy metabolism, protein localization, vesicle-mediated transport, response to stress, G-protein mediated and other signaling pathways suggests that protein palmitoylation may play important roles in oocyte maturation and ffEV-mediated communications within the follicle.
PXD023655	34769235	Hydroxylation of the Acetyltransferase NAA10 Trp38 Is Not an Enzyme-Switch in Human Cells. 	Determining the hydroxylation status of NAA10-Trp38	Asn-OH, Asp-OH, NAA10, NAT, Trp-OH, hydroxylation	NAA10 is a major N-terminal acetyltransferase (NAT) that catalyzes the cotranslational N-terminal (Nt-) acetylation of 40% of the human proteome. Several reports of lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) activity by NAA10 exist, but others have not been able to find any NAA10-derived KAT activity, the latter of which is supported by structural studies. The KAT activity of NAA10 towards hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) was recently found to depend on the hydroxylation at Trp38 of NAA10 by factor inhibiting HIF-1alpha (FIH). In contrast, we could not detect hydroxylation of Trp38 of NAA10 in several human cell lines and found no evidence that NAA10 interacts with or is regulated by FIH. Our data suggest that NAA10 Trp38 hydroxylation is not a switch in human cells and that it alters its catalytic activity from a NAT to a KAT.
PXD028499	34769466	iTRAQ-Based Proteomics Analysis of Response to Solanum tuberosum Leaves Treated with the Plant Phytotoxin Thaxtomin A. 	iTRAQ-based proteomics analysis of response to Solanum tuberosum leaves treated with the plant phytotoxin thaxtomin A	iTRAQ, potato, thaxtomin A	Thaxtomin A (TA) is a phytotoxin secreted by Streptomyces scabies that causes common scab in potatoes. However, the mechanism of potato proteomic changes in response to TA is barely known. In this study, the proteomic changes in potato leaves treated with TA were determined using the Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) technique. A total of 693 proteins were considered as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) following a comparison of leaves treated with TA and sterile water (as a control). Among the identified DEPs, 460 and 233 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses, many DEPs were found to be involved in defense and stress responses. Most DEPs were grouped in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and secondary metabolism including oxidation-reduction process, response to stress, plant-pathogen interaction, and plant hormone signal transduction. In this study, we analyzed the changes in proteins to elucidate the mechanism of potato response to TA, and we provided a molecular basis to further study the interaction between plant and TA. These results also offer the option for potato breeding through analysis of the resistant common scab.
PXD029344	34770976	Deep Membrane Proteome Profiling Reveals Overexpression of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) in High-Risk Human Paraganglioma and Pheochromocytoma, Suggesting New Theranostic Opportunity. 	Deep membrane proteome profiling of high-risk human paraganglioma	Pitchfork strategy, membrane proteome, paraganglioma	Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors arising from chromaffin cells of adrenal medulla or sympathetic or parasympathetic paraganglia, respectively. To identify new therapeutic targets, we performed a detailed membrane-focused proteomic analysis of five human paraganglioma (PGL) samples. Using the Pitchfork strategy, which combines specific enrichments of glycopeptides, hydrophobic transmembrane segments, and non-glycosylated extra-membrane peptides, we identified over 1800 integral membrane proteins (IMPs). We found 45 "tumor enriched" proteins, i.e., proteins identified in all five PGLs but not found in control chromaffin tissue. Among them, 18 IMPs were predicted to be localized on the cell surface, a preferred drug targeting site, including prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a well-established target for nuclear imaging and therapy of advanced prostate cancer. Using specific antibodies, we verified PSMA expression in 22 well-characterized human PPGL samples. Compared to control chromaffin tissue, PSMA was markedly overexpressed in high-risk PPGLs belonging to the established Cluster 1, which is characterized by worse clinical outcomes, pseudohypoxia, multiplicity, recurrence, and metastasis, specifically including SDHB, VHL, and EPAS1 mutations. Using immunohistochemistry, we localized PSMA expression to tumor vasculature. Our study provides the first direct evidence of PSMA overexpression in PPGLs which could translate to therapeutic and diagnostic applications of anti-PSMA radio-conjugates in high-risk PPGLs.
PXD027563	34771115	First Immunoassay for Measuring Isoaspartate in Human Serum Albumin. 	Quantification of isoaspartate levels in human serum albumin of blood samples	Alzheimers disease, Isoaspartate, human serum albumin	Isoaspartate (isoAsp) is a damaging amino acid residue formed in proteins mostly as a result of spontaneous deamidation of asparaginyl residues. An association has been found between isoAsp in human serum albumin (HSA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report on a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1A3 with excellent specificity to isoAsp in the functionally important domain of HSA. Based on 1A3 mAb, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed, and the isoAsp occupancy in 100 healthy plasma samples was quantified for the first time, providing the average value of (0.74 +/- 0.13)%. These results suggest potential of isoAsp measurements for supplementary AD diagnostics as well as for assessing the freshness of stored donor blood and its suitability for transfusion.
PXD026876	34771457	NTRK1/TrkA Signaling in Neuroblastoma Cells Induces Nuclear Reorganization and Intra-Nuclear Aggregation of Lamin A/C. 	Proteomics characterization of NTRK1/TrkA signaling in neuroblastoma cells reveals intra-nuclear aggregation of Lamin A/C	MYCN, NTRK1, TrkA, neuroblastoma, nuclear foci	(1) Background: Neuroblastomas (NBs) are the most common extracranial solid tumors of children. The amplification of the Myc-N proto-oncogene (MYCN) is a major driver of NB aggressiveness, while high expression of the neurotrophin receptor NTRK1/TrkA is associated with mild disease courses. The molecular effects of NTRK1 signaling in MYCN-amplified NB, however, are still poorly understood and require elucidation. (2) Methods: Inducible NTRK1 expression was realized in four NB cell lines with (IMR5, NGP) or without MYCN amplification (SKNAS, SH-SY5Y). Proteome and phosphoproteome dynamics upon NTRK1 activation by its ligand, NGF, were analyzed in a time-dependent manner in IMR5 cells. Target validation by immunofluorescence staining and automated image processing was performed using the three other NB cell lines. (3) Results: In total, 230 proteins and 134 single phosphorylated class I phosphosites were found to be significantly regulated upon NTRK1 activation. Among known NTRK1 targets, Stathmin and the neurosecretory protein VGF were recovered. Additionally, we observed the upregulation and phosphorylation of Lamin A/C (LMNA) that accumulated inside nuclear foci. (4) Conclusions: We provide a comprehensive picture of NTRK1-induced proteome and phosphoproteome dynamics. The phosphorylation of LMNA within nucleic aggregates was identified as a prominent feature of NTRK1 signaling independent of the MYCN status of NB cells.
PXD019653	34771551	Cancer Tissue Classification Using Supervised Machine Learning Applied to MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging. 	Cancer tissue classication using machine learning applied to MALDI MSI and high resolution H&E stained images	CRC  Colorectal cancer  Machine learning MALDI MSI Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging	Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) can determine the spatial distribution of analytes such as protein distributions in a tissue section according to their mass-to-charge ratio. Here, we explored the clinical potential of machine learning (ML) applied to MALDI MSI data for cancer diagnostic classification using tissue microarrays (TMAs) on 302 colorectal (CRC) and 257 endometrial cancer (EC)) patients. ML based on deep neural networks discriminated colorectal tumour from normal tissue with an overall accuracy of 98% in balanced cross-validation (98.2% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity). Moreover, our machine learning approach predicted the presence of lymph node metastasis (LNM) for primary tumours of EC with an accuracy of 80% (90% sensitivity and 69% specificity). Our results demonstrate the capability of MALDI MSI for complementing classic histopathological examination for cancer diagnostic applications.
PXD028651	34771740	A Prostate Cancer Proteomics Database for SWATH-MS Based Protein Quantification. 	A Prostate Cancer Proteomics Database for SWATH-MS based Protein Quantification	Prostate cancer, SWATH-MS, blood proteomics, peptide, protein, spectral library	Prostate cancer is the most frequent form of cancer in men, accounting for more than one-third of all cases. Current screening techniques, such as PSA testing used in conjunction with routine procedures, lead to unnecessary biopsies and the discovery of low-risk tumours, resulting in overdiagnosis. SWATH-MS is a well-established data-independent (DI) method requiring prior knowledge of targeted peptides to obtain valuable information from SWATH maps. In response to the growing need to identify and characterise protein biomarkers for prostate cancer, this study explored a spectrum source for targeted proteome analysis of blood samples. We created a comprehensive prostate cancer serum spectral library by combining data-dependent acquisition (DDA) MS raw files from 504 patients with low, intermediate, or high-grade prostate cancer and healthy controls, as well as 304 prostate cancer-related protein in silico assays. The spectral library contains 114,684 transitions, which equates to 18,479 peptides translated into 1227 proteins. The robustness and accuracy of the spectral library were assessed to boost confidence in the identification and quantification of prostate cancer-related proteins across an independent cohort, resulting in the identification of 404 proteins. This unique database can facilitate researchers to investigate prostate cancer protein biomarkers in blood samples. In the real-world use of the spectrum library for biomarker detection, using a signature of 17 proteins, a clear distinction between the validation cohort's pre- and post-treatment groups was observed. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD028651.
PXD025245	34772700	Transcriptional activity and epigenetic regulation of transposable elements in the symbiotic fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. 	Transcriptional activity and epigenetic regulation of transposable element in the symbiotic fungus Rhizophagus irregularis	fungi	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form mutualistic relationships with most land plant species. AM fungi have long been considered as ancient asexuals. Long-term clonal evolution would be remarkable for a eukaryotic lineage and suggests the importance of alternative mechanisms to promote genetic variability facilitating adaptation. Here, we assessed the potential of transposable elements for generating such genomic diversity. The dynamic expression of TEs during Rhizophagus irregularis spore development suggests ongoing TE activity. We find Mutator-like elements located near genes belonging to highly expanded gene families. Whole-genome epigenomic profiling of R. irregularis provides direct evidence of DNA methylation and small RNA production occurring at TE loci. Our results support a model in which TE activity shapes the genome, while DNA methylation and small RNA-mediated silencing keep their overproliferation in check. We propose that a well-controlled TE activity directly contributes to genome evolution in AM fungi.
PXD028323	34772920	Nuclear and cytoplasmic huntingtin inclusions exhibit distinct biochemical composition, interactome and ultrastructural properties. 	Proteome content of insoluble fraction of Httex1 transduced neurons	Httex1, Huntington disease, inclusions, neurons	Despite the strong evidence linking the aggregation of the Huntingtin protein (Htt) to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD), the mechanisms underlying Htt aggregation and neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the ultrastructural properties and protein composition of Htt cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions in mammalian cells and primary neurons overexpressing mutant exon1 of the Htt protein. Our findings provide unique insight into the ultrastructural properties of cytoplasmic and nuclear Htt inclusions and their mechanisms of formation. We show that Htt inclusion formation and maturation are complex processes that, although initially driven by polyQ-dependent Htt aggregation, also involve the polyQ and PRD domain-dependent sequestration of lipids and cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal proteins related to HD dysregulated pathways; the recruitment and accumulation of remodeled or dysfunctional membranous organelles, and the impairment of the protein quality control and degradation machinery. We also show that nuclear and cytoplasmic Htt inclusions exhibit distinct biochemical compositions and ultrastructural properties, suggesting different mechanisms of aggregation and toxicity.
PXD020417	34772923	Zinc finger protein ZNF384 is an adaptor of Ku to DNA during classical non-homologous end-joining. 	Zinc finger protein ZNF384 is an adaptor of KU to DNA during classical non-homologous end-joining	Double Strand Break Repair, Non Homologous End Joining	DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most deleterious types of DNA damage as they can lead to mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, which underlie cancer development. Classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) is the dominant pathway for DSB repair in human cells, involving the DNA-binding proteins XRCC6 (Ku70) and XRCC5 (Ku80). Other DNA-binding proteins such as Zinc Finger (ZnF) domain-containing proteins have also been implicated in DNA repair, but their role in cNHEJ remained elusive. Here we show that ZNF384, a member of the C2H2 family of ZnF proteins, binds DNA ends in vitro and is recruited to DSBs in vivo. ZNF384 recruitment requires the poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-dependent expansion of damaged chromatin, followed by binding of its C2H2 motifs to the exposed DNA. Moreover, ZNF384 interacts with Ku70/Ku80 via its N-terminus, thereby promoting Ku70/Ku80 assembly and the accrual of downstream cNHEJ factors, including APLF and XRCC4/LIG4, for efficient repair at DSBs. Altogether, our data suggest that ZNF384 acts as a 'Ku-adaptor' that binds damaged DNA and Ku70/Ku80 to facilitate the build-up of a cNHEJ repairosome, highlighting a role for ZNF384 in DSB repair and genome maintenance.
PXD025980	34774526	Proximity-dependent biotinylation detects associations between SARS coronavirus nonstructural protein 1 and stress granule-associated proteins. 	Proximity-dependent biotinylation detects association between stress granule associated proteins and SARS coronavirus nonstructural protein 1	BioID2, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, nsp1, stress granule	The nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a critical viral protein that suppresses host gene expression by blocking the assembly of the ribosome on host mRNAs. To understand the mechanism of inhibition of host gene expression, we sought to identify cellular proteins that interact with nsp1. Using proximity-dependent biotinylation followed by proteomic analyses of biotinylated proteins, here we captured multiple dynamic interactions of nsp1 with host cell proteins. In addition to ribosomal proteins, we identified several pre-mRNA processing proteins that interact with nsp1, including splicing factors and transcription termination proteins, as well as exosome, and stress granule (SG)-associated proteins. We found that the interactions with transcription termination factors are primarily governed by the C-terminal region of nsp1 and are disrupted by the mutation of amino acids K164 and H165 that are essential for its host shutoff function. We further show that nsp1 interacts with Ras GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and colocalizes with G3BP1 in SGs under sodium arsenite-induced stress. Finally, we observe that the presence of nsp1 disrupts the maturation of SGs over a long period. Isolation of SG core at different times shows a gradual loss of G3BP1 in the presence of nsp1.
PXD026442	34774760	Immune response pattern across the asymptomatic, symptomatic and convalescent periods of COVID-19. 	Immune response pattern across the asymptomatic, symptomatic and convalescent periods of COVID-19	COVID-19, asymptomatic, convalescent periods, symptomatic	We present an integrated analysis of urine and serum proteomics and clinical measurements in asymptomatic, mild/moderate, severe and convalescent cases of COVID-19. We identify the pattern of immune response during COVID-19 infection. The immune response is activated in asymptomatic infection, but is dysregulated in mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Our data suggest that the turning point depends on the function of myeloid cells and neutrophils. In addition, immune defects persist into the recovery stage, until 12 months after diagnosis. Moreover, disorders of cholesterol metabolism span the entire progression of the disease, starting from asymptomatic infection and lasting to recovery. Our data suggest that prolonged dysregulation of the immune response and cholesterol metabolism might be the pivotal causative agent of other potential sequelae. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis, which is instructive for the development of early intervention strategies to ameliorate complex disease sequelae.
PXD023927	34774773	Integrative Multi-omics Landscape of Non-structural Protein 3 of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses. 	An Integrative multi-omics landscape of SARS-CoVs NSP3	NSP3, SARS-CoV	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is currently a global pandemic. Extensive investigations have been performed to study the clinical and cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies have revealed the cellular changes due to the infection and identified a plethora of interactors for all SARS-CoV-2 components, except for the longest non-structural protein 3 (NSP3). Here, we expressed the full-length NSP3 proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to investigate their unique and shared functions using multi-omics methods. We conducted interactome, phosphoproteome, ubiquitylome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses of NSP3-expressing cells. We found that NSP3 plays essential roles in cellular functions such as RNA metabolism and immune response (e.g., NF-kappaB signal transduction). Interestingly, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 has both endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial localizations. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 is more closely related to mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, whereas SARS-CoV NSP3 is related to the cytosolic ribosomal proteins. In summary, our integrative multi-omics study of NSP3 improves the understanding of the functions of NSP3 and offers potential targets for the development of anti-SARS strategies.
PXD025883	34776928	proNGF Measurement in Cerebrospinal Fluid Samples of a Large Cohort of Living Patients With Alzheimer's Disease by a New Automated Immunoassay. 	LC-MS/MS analysis of NGF proteins  purified from cerebrospinal fluid	Alzheimer, NGF, cerebrospinal fluid	The discovery of new biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for an accurate diagnosis, to conceive new strategies of treatments, and for monitoring the efficacy of potential disease-modifying therapies in clinical trials. proNGF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represent a promising diagnostic biomarker for AD, but its validation was hampered by the absence of a reliable immunoassay. In the literature, proNGF is currently measured in postmortem brain tissue by semiquantitative immunoblot. Here we describe the development and validation of a new method to measure proNGF in the CSF of living patients. This method, based on molecular size separation by capillary electrophoresis, is automated and shows a 40-fold increase in sensitivity with respect to the proNGF immunoblot, largely used in literature, and is robust, specific, and scalable to high-throughput. We have measured proNGF in the cerebrospinal fluid of 84 living patients with AD, 13 controls, and 15 subjective memory complaints (SMC) subjects. By comparing the proNGF levels in the three groups, we found a very significant difference between proNGF levels in AD samples compared with both controls and SMC subjects, while no significant difference was found between SMC and controls. Because of the development of this new immunoassay, we are ready to explore the potentiality of proNGF as a new biomarker for AD or subgroups thereof, as well as for other neurodegenerative diseases.
PXD028003	34777248	Pathogenesis of Enamel-Renal Syndrome Associated Gingival Fibromatosis: A Proteomic Approach. 	Pathogenesis of enamel-renal syndrome associated gingival fibromatosis: a proteomic approach	Pathogenesis of enamel-renal syndrome associated gingival fibromatosis: a proteomic approach	The enamel renal syndrome (ERS) is a rare disorder featured by amelogenesis imperfecta, gingival fibromatosis and nephrocalcinosis. ERS is caused by bi-allelic mutations in the secretory pathway pseudokinase FAM20A. How mutations in FAM20A may modify the gingival connective tissue homeostasis and cause fibromatosis is currently unknown. We here analyzed conditioned media of gingival fibroblasts (GFs) obtained from four unrelated ERS patients carrying distinct mutations and control subjects. Secretomic analysis identified 109 dysregulated proteins whose abundance had increased (69 proteins) or decreased (40 proteins) at least 1.5-fold compared to control GFs. Proteins over-represented were mainly involved in extracellular matrix organization, collagen fibril assembly, and biomineralization whereas those under-represented were extracellular matrix-associated proteins. More specifically, transforming growth factor-beta 2, a member of the TGFbeta family involved in both mineralization and fibrosis was strongly increased in samples from GFs of ERS patients and so were various known targets of the TGFbeta signaling pathway including Collagens, Matrix metallopeptidase 2 and Fibronectin. For the over-expressed proteins quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed increased transcript levels, suggesting increased synthesis and this was further confirmed at the tissue level. Additional immunohistochemical and western blot analyses showed activation and nuclear localization of the classical TGFbeta effector phospho-Smad3 in both ERS gingival tissue and ERS GFs. Exposure of the mutant cells to TGFB1 further upregulated the expression of TGFbeta targets suggesting that this pathway could be a central player in the pathogenesis of the ERS gingival fibromatosis. In conclusion our data strongly suggest that TGFbeta -induced modifications of the extracellular matrix contribute to the pathogenesis of ERS. To our knowledge this is the first proteomic-based analysis of FAM20A-associated modifications.
PXD027606	34777268	Profiling Tryptophan Catabolites of Human Gut Microbiota and Acute-Phase Protein Levels in Neonatal Dried Blood Specimens. 	Profiling Tryptophan Catabolites of Human Gut Microbiota and Acute-Phase Protein Levels in Neonatal Dried Blood Specimens	Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, RECETOX	National screening programs use dried blood specimens to detect metabolic disorders or aberrant protein functions that are not clinically evident in the neonatal period. Similarly, gut microbiota metabolites and immunological acute-phase proteins may reveal latent immune aberrations. Microbial metabolites interact with xenobiotic receptors (i.e., aryl hydrocarbon and pregnane-X) to maintain gastrointestinal tissue health, supported by acute-phase proteins, functioning as sensors of microbial immunomodulation and homeostasis. The delivery (vaginal or cesarean section) shapes the microbial colonization, which substantially modulates both the immune system's response and mucosal homeostasis. This study profiled microbial metabolites of the kynurenine and tryptophan pathway and acute-phase proteins in 134 neonatal dried blood specimens. We newly established neonatal blood levels of microbial xenobiotic receptors ligands (i.e., indole-3-aldehyde, indole-3-butyric acid, and indole-3-acetamide) on the second day of life. Furthermore, we observed diverse microbial metabolic profiles in neonates born vaginally and via cesarean section, potentially due to microbial immunomodulatory influence. In summary, these findings suggest the supportive role of human gut microbiota in developing and maintaining immune system homeostasis.
PXD026510	34777349	Plasma Gradient of Soluble Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator Receptor Is Linked to Pathogenic Plasma Proteome and Immune Transcriptome and Stratifies Outcomes in Severe COVID-19. 	Plasma gradient of soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor is linked to pathogenic plasma proteome and immune transcriptome and is a prognostic biomarker for severe COVID-19	ARDS, COVID-19, Covid-19, Myeloid cells, PLAUR, Prognosis, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, soluble UPAR	Disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) led to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. A systemic hyper-inflammation characterizes severe COVID-19 disease, often associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Blood biomarkers capable of risk stratification are of great importance in effective triage and critical care of severe COVID-19 patients. Flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing were done on peripheral blood cells and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), and cytokines were measured from and mass spectrometry-based proteomics was done on plasma samples from an Indian cohort of COVID-19 patients. Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data were analyzed for validation of primary data. Statistical analyses were performed to validate risk stratification. We report here higher plasma abundance of suPAR, expressed by an abnormally expanded myeloid cell population, in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The plasma suPAR level was found to be linked to a characteristic plasma proteome, associated with coagulation disorders and complement activation. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis to predict mortality identified a cutoff value of suPAR at 1,996.809 pg/ml (odds ratio: 2.9286, 95% confidence interval 1.0427-8.2257). Lower-than-cutoff suPAR levels were associated with a differential expression of the immune transcriptome as well as favorable clinical outcomes, in terms of both survival benefit (hazard ratio: 0.3615, 95% confidence interval 0.1433-0.912) and faster disease remission in our patient cohort. Thus, we identified suPAR as a key pathogenic circulating molecule linking systemic hyperinflammation to the hypercoagulable state and stratifying clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS.
PXD028095	34778348	Skimmed Bovine Milk-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Isolated via "Salting-Out": Characterizations and Potential Functions as Nanocarriers. 	Proteomic analysis of bovine milk-derived extracellular vesicles isolated via salting-out	bovine, extracellular vesicles, milk	Bovine milk-derived extracellular vesicles (BM-EVs) are recognized as promising nanoscale delivery vectors owing to their large availability. However, few isolation methods can achieve high purity and yield simultaneously. Therefore, we developed a novel and cost-effective procedure to separate BM-EVs via "salting-out." First, BM-EVs were isolated from skimmed milk using ammonium sulfate. The majority of BM-EVs were precipitated between 30 and 40% saturation and 34% had a relatively augmented purity. The separated BM-EVs showed a spherical shape with a diameter of 60-150 nm and expressed the marker proteins CD63, TSG101, and Hsp70. The purity and yield were comparable to the BM-EVs isolated via ultracentrifugation while ExoQuick failed to separate a relatively pure fraction of BM-EVs. The uptake of BM-EVs into endothelial cells was dose- and time-dependent without significant cytotoxicity. The levels of endothelial nitric oxide syntheses were regulated by BM-EVs loaded with icariside II and miRNA-155-5p, suggesting their functions as delivery vehicles. These findings have demonstrated that it is an efficient procedure to isolate BM-EVs via "salting-out," holding great promise toward therapeutic applications.
PXD026795	34779632	Targeted Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Sequence Variants by Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Tryptic Peptides. 	Targeted Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Protein Variants by Mass Spectrometry	Nucleocapsid, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, Single Amino Acid Protein Variants, Tandem Mass Spectrometry	COVID-19 vaccines are becoming more widely available, but accurate and rapid testing remains a crucial tool for slowing the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Although the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) remains the most prevalent testing methodology, numerous tests have been developed that are predicated on detection of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, including liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and immunoassay-based approaches. The continuing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has complicated these approaches, as both qRT-PCR and antigen detection methods can be prone to missing viral variants. In this study, we describe several COVID-19 cases where we were unable to detect the expected peptide targets from clinical nasopharyngeal swabs. Whole genome sequencing revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding the viral nucleocapsid protein led to sequence variants that were not monitored in the targeted assay. Minor modifications to the LC-MS/MS method ensured detection of the variants of the target peptide. Additional nucleocapsid variants could be detected by performing the bottom-up proteomic analysis of whole viral genome-sequenced samples. This study demonstrates the importance of considering variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the assay design and highlights the flexibility of mass spectrometry-based approaches to detect variants as they evolve.
PXD010456	34780171	ZIC-cHILIC-Based StageTip for Simultaneous Glycopeptide Enrichment and Fractionation toward Large-Scale N-Sialoglycoproteomics. 	Sialo-glycoproteome of Human lung cancer cell by LC-MSMS	glycoproteome, human lung cancer, sialo-glycoproteome	Alterations of protein glycosylation are closely related with pathophysiological regulation. Due to the structural macro- and microheterogeneity, low stoichiometry, and low ionization efficiency of glycopeptides, high-performance tools to enrich glycopeptides, especially the negatively charged and labile sialoglycopeptides, are essential to enhance the identification of the underexplored glycoproteome. Here, we present the first implementation of zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction chromatography with the exposed choline group (ZIC-cHILIC) in StageTip for simultaneous enrichment and fractionation of intact glycopeptides. In a model study using lung cancer cells, early elution by a high percentage of acetonitrile prominently prefilters nonglycopeptides, facilitating high enrichment specificity for glycopeptides (92-96%) and sialoglycopeptides (77-89%) in the subsequent hydrophilic fractions. The stepwise elution shows a high glycopeptide fractionation efficiency by a <10% overlap of glycopeptides between adjacent fractions. Most importantly, the ZIC-cHILIC stepwise strategy demonstrated good reproducibility (>80% in triplicate analysis) as well as superior coverage of 4.6- to 12.0-fold and 2.1- to 35.6-fold more glycopeptides and sialoglycopeptides compared to conventional TiO2 and ZIC-HILIC, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the result with 2742 sialoglycopeptides among 7367 unique glycopeptides and 166 glycans from 2434 N-glycosites of 1118 glycoproteins (Byonic score > 100) provides one of the deepest glycoproteomic profiles in single-cell type. Without the immunoprecipitation step, the large-scale glycoproteomic atlas also reveals site-specific glycosylation of many druggable receptor proteins, such as EGFR, MET, ERBB2, ERBB3, AXL, and IGF1R. The demonstrated high enrichment specificity and identification depth show that stepwise ZIC-cHILIC is an efficient method to explore the under-represented sialoglycoproteome.
PXD027449	34781029	Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals the metabolic characteristics and adaptive mechanism of Cupriavidus oxalaticus T2 in the process of simultaneous nitrogen and phenol removal. 	Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals the metabolic characteristics and adaptive mechanism of Cupriavidus oxalaticus in the process of simultaneous nitrogen and phenol removal	Cupriavidus, DIA, bacteria	Phenol and ammonia in wastewater pose a serious threat to ecosystems and human health. However, the currently limited studies on single bacterium simultaneously removing phenol and nitrogen pollution have not fully elucidated the relevant metabolic mechanisms. The differences in proteomic profile after supplementing with phenol and ammonia for 6 and 24 h, respectively, were evaluated to explore the metabolic characteristics and adaptive mechanism of Cupriavidus oxalaticus T2 during the simultaneous removal process of phenol and nitrogen. Results revealed that a new potential phenol para-degradation pathway appeared in T2. Phenol induced changes in nitrogen metabolism, resulting in increased denitrification and decreased synthesis of glutamate from ammonia at 6 h. In addition, phenol exposure enhanced the expression of cytochrome oxidases with high oxygen affinity and increased ATP synthesis. The increase in chemotaxis and flagellar assembly was conducive to the uptake and utilization of phenol. The synthesis of lipoic acid and biotin was also promoted to resist phenol toxicity. Moreover, phenol triggered cellular stress response, thereby leading to the upregulation of anti-stress proteins, such as universal stress protein, iron-sulfur cluster protein, and chaperones. This study contributes to revealing the metabolic characteristics and adaptive mechanism of T2 during simultaneous nitrogen and phenol removal. SIGNIFICANCE: Phenol and ammonia often co-exist in wastewater, causing serious environmental problems. The information on the metabolic mechanism of simultaneously removing these two pollutants by bacteria is insufficient at present. Moreover, phenol is toxic to microbial and causes cells damage. Therefore, exploring the response mechanism of bacteria to phenol stress is conducive to understand their tolerance mechanism to aromatic compounds. In this study, the metabolic characteristics and adaptive mechanism of C. oxalaticus T2 during the simultaneous removal of phenol and nitrogen process were evaluated by comparing the proteome profiles at different stages. The results revealed the degradation pathways of phenol and nitrogen by strain T2. A variety of phenol response mechanisms were determined, including enhanced energy production, improved cell motility, increased the synthesis of lipoic acid and biotin, and combined action of multiple anti-stress proteins. This study is potentially useful to future phenol and nitrogen co-pollution bioremediation strategies and provides insight into the phenolic compound resistance mechanism in bacteria.
PXD022466	34781030	Proteomics analysis of N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced cell death in retinal and optic nerves. 	Rat retina and optic nerve LC-MS/MS	Rat, optic nerve, retina	This study aimed to comprehensively understand the proteomic characteristics and modulation of the neural microenvironment with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced neuronal degeneration in the retina and optic nerve at 12 h after intravitreal injection of 40 nmol NMDA. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed at 12 h after intravitreal injection of 40 nmol NMDA. PBS-injected eyes served as controls. The key cell death-linked proteins from the retina and optic nerve tissues were assessed by a mass spectrometry-based label-free approach. In proteomics analysis, we identified 3532 proteins in retinal tissues and 2593 proteins in optic nerve tissues. The ACSL3 (Q63151) and Prnp (P13852) proteins were upregulated in the NMDA-damaged retina and connected with ferroptosis. The Gabarapl2 (P60522) protein was upregulated in NMDA-damaged optic nerves and connected with autophagy. We performed parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to validate the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) results. Data are available ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD022466 (label-free quantification) and PXD022729 (PRM validation). SIGNIFICANCE: Excitotoxicity is one of the pathogeneses of various retinal disorders, including glaucoma, retinal ischemia-reperfusion and traumatic optic neuropathy. This study indicated that ferroptosis may be linked to pathological cell death in the retina with NMDA insult. Autophagy may be induced by NMDA overstimulation in both the optic nerve and retina. Regulating these types of death simultaneously may provide the maximum benefit for retinal disease therapy.
PXD027699	34781745	The Heterotrimeric Transcription Factor CCAAT-Binding Complex and Ca(2+)-CrzA Signaling Reversely Regulate the Transition between Fungal Hyphal Growth and Asexual Reproduction. 	Comparative proteomics data of wild-type and hapB deletion strains under the background of A1160	hapB deletion	The life cycle of filamentous fungi generally comprises hyphal growth and asexual reproduction. Both growth and propagation processes are critical for invasion growth, spore dissemination, and virulence in fungal pathogens and for the production of secondary metabolites or for biomass accumulation in industrial filamentous fungi. The CCAAT-binding complex (CBC) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor comprising three subunits, HapB, HapC, and HapE, and is highly conserved in fungi. Previous studies revealed that CBC regulates sterol metabolism by repressing several genes in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway in the human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. In the present study, we found dysfunction of CBC caused the abnormal asexual reproduction (conidiation) in submerged liquid culture. CBC suppresses the activation of the brlA gene in the central regulatory pathway for conidiation combined with its upstream regulators fluG, flbD, and flbC by binding to the 5'-CCAAT-3' motif within conidiation gene promoters, and lack of CBC member HapB results in the upregulation of these genes. Furthermore, when the expression of brlA or flbC is repressed, the submerged conidiation does not happen in the hapB mutant. Interestingly, deletion of HapB leads to enhanced transient cytosolic Ca(2+) levels and activates conidiation-positive inducer Ca(2+)-CrzA modules to enhance submerged conidiation, demonstrating that CrzA works with CBC as a reverse regulator of fungal conidiation. To the best of our knowledge, the finding of this study is the first report for the molecular switch mechanism between vegetative hyphal growth and asexual development regulated by CBC, in concert with Ca(2+)-CrzA signaling in A. fumigatus. IMPORTANCE A precisely timed switch between vegetative hyphal growth and asexual development is a crucial process for the filamentous fungal long-term survival, dissemination, biomass production, and virulence. However, under the submerged culture condition, filamentous fungi would undergo constant vegetative growth whereas asexual conidiation rarely occurs. Knowledge about possible regulators is scarce, and how they could inhibit conidiation in liquid culture is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the transcription factor heterotrimeric CBC dominantly maintains vegetative growth in liquid-submerged cultures by directly suppressing the conidiation-inductive signal. In contrast, calcium and the transcription factor CrzA, are positive inducers of conidiation. Our new insights into the CBC and Ca(2+)-CrzA regulatory system for transition control in the submerged conidiation of A. fumigatus may have broad repercussions for all filamentous fungi. Moreover, our elucidation of the molecular mechanism for submerged conidiation may support new strategies to precisely control vegetative growth and asexual conidiation in aspergilli used in industry.
PXD029457	34782466	Staphylococcal ClpXP protease targets the cellular antioxidant system to eliminate fitness-compromised cells in stationary phase. 	Staphylococcal ClpXP protease targets the cellular antioxidant system to eliminate fitness-compromised cells in stationary phase	Staphylococcus aureus, cell death, clpP, clpX, competitive fitness, sodA, stationary phase	The transition from growth to stationary phase is a natural response of bacteria to starvation and stress. When stress is alleviated and more favorable growth conditions return, bacteria resume proliferation without a significant loss in fitness. Although specific adaptations that enhance the persistence and survival of bacteria in stationary phase have been identified, mechanisms that help maintain the competitive fitness potential of nondividing bacterial populations have remained obscure. Here, we demonstrate that staphylococci that enter stationary phase following growth in media supplemented with excess glucose, undergo regulated cell death to maintain the competitive fitness potential of the population. Upon a decrease in extracellular pH, the acetate generated as a byproduct of glucose metabolism induces cytoplasmic acidification and extensive protein damage in nondividing cells. Although cell death ensues, it does not occur as a passive consequence of protein damage. Instead, we demonstrate that the expression and activity of the ClpXP protease is induced, resulting in the degeneration of cellular antioxidant capacity and, ultimately, cell death. Under these conditions, inactivation of either clpX or clpP resulted in the extended survival of unfit cells in stationary phase, but at the cost of maintaining population fitness. Finally, we show that cell death from antibiotics that interfere with bacterial protein synthesis can also be partly ascribed to the corresponding increase in clpP expression and activity. The functional conservation of ClpP in eukaryotes and bacteria suggests that ClpP-dependent cell death and fitness maintenance may be a widespread phenomenon in these domains of life.
PXD022751	34783559	Potential Use of Serum Proteomics for Monitoring COVID-19 Progression to Complement RT-PCR Detection. 	Proteomic Analysis of Inactivated and Sterilized Sera might be Applied to Monitoring the Disease Course of COVID-19	COVID-19, SWATH-MS, biomarker, serum	RT-PCR is the primary method to diagnose COVID-19 and is also used to monitor the disease course. This approach, however, suffers from false negatives due to RNA instability and poses a high risk to medical practitioners. Here, we investigated the potential of using serum proteomics to predict viral nucleic acid positivity during COVID-19. We analyzed the proteome of 275 inactivated serum samples from 54 out of 144 COVID-19 patients and shortlisted 42 regulated proteins in the severe group and 12 in the non-severe group. Using these regulated proteins and several key clinical indexes, including days after symptoms onset, platelet counts, and magnesium, we developed two machine learning models to predict nucleic acid positivity, with an AUC of 0.94 in severe cases and 0.89 in non-severe cases, respectively. Our data suggest the potential of using a serum protein-based machine learning model to monitor COVID-19 progression, thus complementing swab RT-PCR tests. More efforts are required to promote this approach into clinical practice since mass spectrometry-based protein measurement is not currently widely accessible in clinic.
PXD028697	34785636	Co-activation of Sonic hedgehog and Wnt signaling in murine retinal precursor cells drives ocular lesions with features of intraocular medulloepithelioma. 	Co-activation of Sonic hedgehog and Wnt signaling in murine retinal precursor cells drives ocular lesions with features of intraocular medulloepithelioma	Intraocular medulloepethelioma, bottom up, cancer, hedghog signaling, mouse model, wnt signaling	Intraocular medulloepithelioma (IO-MEPL) is a rare embryonal ocular neoplasm, prevalently occurring in children. IO-MEPLs share histomorphological features with CNS embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMRs), referred to as intracranial medulloepitheliomas. While Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and WNT signaling pathways are crucial for ETMR pathogenesis, the impact of these pathways on human IO-MEPL development is unclear. Gene expression analyses of human embryonal tumor samples revealed similar gene expression patterns and significant overrepresentation of SHH and WNT target genes in both IO-MEPL and ETMR. In order to unravel the function of Shh and Wnt signaling for IO-MEPL pathogenesis in vivo, both pathways were activated in retinal precursor cells in a time point specific manner. Shh and Wnt co-activation in early Sox2- or Rax-expressing precursor cells resulted in infiltrative ocular lesions that displayed extraretinal expansion. Histomorphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features showed a strong concordance with human IO-MEPL. We demonstrate a relevant role of WNT and SHH signaling in IO-MEPL and report the first mouse model to generate tumor-like lesions with features of IO-MEPL. The presented data may be fundamental for comprehending IO-MEPL initiation and developing targeted therapeutic approaches.
PXD024642	34785650	mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of VAMP8 and SCFD1 regulates autophagosome maturation. 	mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of VAMP8 prevents a starvation-induced VAMP8-SCFD1 interaction that promotes SNARE activity and autolysosome fusion		The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) has been shown to regulate autophagy at different steps. However, how mTORC1 regulates the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive protein receptor (SNARE) complex remains elusive. Here we show that mTORC1 inhibits formation of the SNARE complex (STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8) by phosphorylating VAMP8, thereby blocking autophagosome-lysosome fusion. A VAMP8 phosphorylation mimic mutant is unable to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion in vitro. Furthermore, we identify SCFD1, a Sec1/Munc18-like protein, that localizes to the autolysosome and is required for SNARE complex formation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion. VAMP8 promotes SCFD1 recruitment to autolysosomes when dephosphorylated. Consistently, phosphorylated VAMP8 or SCFD1 depletion inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and expression of phosphomimic VAMP8 leads to increased lipid droplet accumulation when expressed in mouse liver. Thus, our study supports that mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of VAMP8 blocks SCFD1 recruitment, thereby inhibiting STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 complex formation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion.
PXD016088	34786044	Inhibition of bone morphogenetic proteins signaling suppresses metastasis melanoma: a proteomics approach. 	Proteomic profiling of murine melanoma treated with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling inhibitor	Melanoma, Protein Profiling, bRPLC, cancer, skin	BACKGROUND: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, known to promote the tumor invasion and metastasis. There are continual progresses in understanding the role of BMP signaling pathways in carcinogenesis. However, the biological significance of BMPs in human melanoma has received very little attention. The study aimed to explore the effect of BMP inhibition on melanoma treated with LDN193189 (BMP inhibitor) using a quantitative proteomics approach in a melanoma xenograft model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Melanoma tumor was induced in C57BL6 mice and treated intraperitoneally with LDN193189 for ten consecutive days. Post-treatment, tumors were collected, and comparative proteomics was performed using a high-resolution Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer. RESULTS: Treatment of melanoma with LDN193189 at 3 mg/kg body weight twice daily showed a significant decrease in the growth rate of the tumor compared to the other doses tested. Quantitative proteomic profiling identified 3231 proteins. Bioinformatics analysis of the 131 differentially expressed proteins selected by their relative abundance revealed that LDN193189 induces alterations in the cellular and metabolic process and the proteins that are involved in protein binding and catalytic activity in melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation of metallothionein (MT) 1 and MT2, emerging proteins for their role in tumor formation, progression, and drug resistance and transcription factor EB that plays a crucial role in the regulation of basic cellular processes, such as lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, were identified upon inhibition of the BMP pathway in melanoma, suggesting their roles in melanoma growth. Understanding the role of these proteins will provide new directions for treating cancer.
PXD010358	34786609	Proteomic analysis of differential expression of lung proteins in response to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection in chickens. 	Lung proteome analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) infection progression in chicken	Avian Influenza, Chicken, LC-MS, Lung tissues, pathogenesis	Elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis underlying virus-host interactions is important for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus infection in chickens. However, the pathogenesis of HPAI virus in chickens is not completely understood. To identify the intracellular signaling pathways and critical host proteins associated with influenza pathogenesis, we analyzed the lung proteome of a chicken infected with HPAI H5N1 virus (A/duck/India/02CA10/2011/Agartala). Mass spectrometry data sets were searched against the chicken UniProt reference database. At the local false discovery rate level of 5%, a total of 3313 proteins with the presence of at least one unique peptide were identified in the chicken lung proteome datasets. Differential expression analysis of these proteins showed that 247 and 1754 proteins were downregulated at 12 h and 48 h postinfection, respectively. We observed expression of proteins of the predominant signaling pathways, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and JAK-STAT signaling. Activation of these pathways is associated with the cytokine storm effect and thus may be the cause of the severity of HPAI H5N1 infection in chickens. We also observed the expression of myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKBKB), interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), RELA proto-oncogene NF-kappaB subunit (RELA), and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which are involved in critical signaling pathways, as well as other, less-commonly identified proteins such as hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A), ELAV-like RNA binding protein 1 (ELAVL1), fibronectin 1 (FN1), COP9 signalosome subunit 5 (COPS5), cullin 1 (CUL1), breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1), and the FYN proto-oncogene Src family tyrosine kinase (FYN) as main hub proteins that might play important roles in influenza pathogenesis in chickens. In summary, we identified the signaling pathways and the proteomic determinants associated with disease pathogenesis in chickens infected with HPAI H5N1 virus.
PXD024166	34787304	Temperature-induced reorganisation of Schistocephalus solidus (Cestoda) proteome during the transition to the warm-blooded host. 	Proteome of Schistocephalus solidus (Cestoda) after short- and long-term heating	Cestoda, Schistocephalus solidus, host-parasite interaction, parasite, plerocercoid	The protein composition of the cestode Schistocephalus solidus was measured in an experiment simulating the trophic transmission of the parasite from a cold-blooded to a warm-blooded host. The first hour of host colonisation was studied in a model experiment, in which sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus infected with S. solidus were heated at 40degreesC for 1 h. As a result, a decrease in the content of one tegument protein was detected in the plerocercoids of S. solidus. Sexual maturation of the parasites was initiated in an experiment where S. solidus larvae were taken from fish and cultured in vitro at 40degreesC for 48 h. Temperature-independent changes in the parasite proteome were investigated by incubating plerocercoids at 22degreesC for 48 h in culture medium. Analysis of the proteome allowed us to distinguish the temperature-induced genes of S. solidus, as well as to specify the molecular markers of the plerocercoid and adult worms. The main conclusion of the study is that the key enzymes of long-term metabolic changes (glycogen consumption, protein production, etc.) in parasites during colonisation of a warm-blooded host are induced by temperature.
PXD029794	34789007	Locus-Conserved Circular RNA cZNF292 Controls Endothelial Cell Flow Responses. 	Profiling of protein interactions of the circRNA cZNF292 in endothelial cells	affinity purification, circRNA, endothelial cells	BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are generated by back splicing of mostly mRNAs and are gaining increasing attention as a novel class of regulatory RNAs that control various cellular functions. However, their physiological roles and functional conservation in vivo are rarely addressed, given the inherent challenges of their genetic inactivation. Here, we aimed to identify locus conserved circRNAs in mice and humans, which can be genetically deleted due to retained intronic elements not contained in the mRNA host gene to eventually address functional conservation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Combining published endothelial RNA-sequencing data sets with circRNAs of the circATLAS databank, we identified locus-conserved circRNA retaining intronic elements between mice and humans. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genetic depletion of the top expressed circRNA cZfp292 resulted in an altered endothelial morphology and aberrant flow alignment in the aorta in vivo. Consistently, depletion of cZNF292 in endothelial cells in vitro abolished laminar flow-induced alterations in cell orientation, paxillin localization and focal adhesion organization. Mechanistically, we identified the protein SDOS (syndesmos) to specifically interact with cZNF292 in endothelial cells by RNA-affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of SDOS or its protein binding partner Syndecan-4, or mutation of the SDOS-cZNF292 binding site, prevented laminar flow-induced cytoskeletal reorganization thereby recapitulating cZfp292 knockout phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our data reveal a hitherto unknown role of cZNF292/cZfp292 in endothelial flow responses, which influences endothelial shape.
PXD024999	34789561	Characterization of Novel alpha-Mangostin and Paeonol Derivatives With Cancer-Selective Cytotoxicity. 	Characterization of novel a-Mangostin and Paeonol derivatives with cancer-selective cytotoxicity	Colorectal cancer, Paeonol, a-Mangostin, anti-cancer drugs, cancer-selective compounds, colon cancer organoids, natural compound derivatives	alpha-Mangostin (aMan) and Paeonol (Pae) have shown anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. However, these two natural compounds have no clinical value because of their low solubility and low membrane permeability. In this study, we screened chemically synthesized derivatives from these two natural compounds as potential novel chemicals that increase cancer cell cytotoxicity over nontransformed human cells. We found that two derivative compounds, named alpha-Mangostin-1 (aMan1) and Paeonol-1 (Pae1) more efficiently and more specifically induced cytotoxicity in HCT116, HT29, and SW48 colorectal cancer cell lines than the parental compounds. Both aMan1 and Pae1 arrested HCT116 cells in the G1 phase and HT29 and SW48 cells in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle. Both aMan1 and Pae1 induced apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells, through a caspase-dependent mechanism. aMan1 and Pae1 induced selective transcriptional responses in colorectal cancer cells involving genes related to metabolic stress and DNA damage response signaling pathways. Finally, experiments on primary colon organoids showed that both derivatives were able to kill cancer-derived organoids without affecting the viability of organoids derived from healthy tissue, where the parental compounds and the currently used chemotherapeutic drug irinotecan failed. In conclusion, our findings expand the knowledge of natural compound derivatives as anticancer agents and open new avenues of research in the derivation of lead compounds aimed at developing novel chemotherapeutic drugs for colorectal cancer treatment that selectively target cancer, but not healthy cells.
PXD026439	34791804	Plasma proteome profiling using tandem mass tag labeling technology reveals potential biomarkers for Parkinson's disease: a preliminary study. 	Plasma proteomics dataset of Parkinson's Disease	Parkinsons Disease, Plasma, tandem mass tag	PURPOSE: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequently occurring progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Biomarkers are useful indicators for tracking disease progression, early diagnosis, and intervention of disease progression. We aimed to develop plasma biomarker panel which maybe aid to predict the onset and progression of PD. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tandem mass tag (TMT) mass spectrometry was applied using an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer to analyze plasma protein expression in patients diagnosed with PD and healthy controls. RESULTS: In total, 555 proteins were quantified. Using a cut-off of p < 0.05 and a fold change of >1.2 for the variation in expression, 25 proteins were differentially expressed between the PD and control groups. Sixteen proteins were upregulated and nine were downregulated. Several proteins, including Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) and thymosin beta-4 (TMSB4X) were implicated in PD pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The data from the TMT-based proteomic profiling of plasma samples in PD may help advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PD and identify potential novel biomarkers of PD for further characterization.

PXD026603	34793198	Cryo-EM structure of human GPR158 receptor coupled to the RGS7-Gbeta5 signaling complex. 	XL-MS Analysis of Recombinant GPR158:RGS7:Gb5 Complex in Detergent Micelles	Chemical Crosslinking, G-protein coupled receptor, GPCR-RGS complex, GPR158, Gb5, Membrane protein complex, RGS7, orphan GPCR	GPR158 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) highly expressed in the brain, where it controls synapse formation and function. GPR158 has also been implicated in depression, carcinogenesis, and cognition. However, the structural organization and signaling mechanisms of GPR158 are largely unknown. We used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of human GPR158 alone and bound to an RGS signaling complex. The structures reveal a homodimeric organization stabilized by a pair of phospholipids and the presence of an extracellular Cache domain, an unusual ligand-binding domain in GPCRs. We further demonstrate the structural basis of GPR158 coupling to RGS7-Gbeta5. Together, these results provide insights into the unusual biology of orphan receptors and the formation of GPCR-RGS complexes.
PXD023885	34793694	Developmental defects in Huntington's disease show that axonal growth and microtubule reorganization require NUMA1. 	Proteomic analysis of growth cones from WT and HD mice	Growth Cone, Huntington's disease	Although the classic symptoms of Huntington's disease (HD) manifest in adulthood, neural progenitor cell behavior is already abnormal by 13 weeks' gestation. To determine how these developmental defects evolve, we turned to cell and mouse models. We found that layer II/III neurons that normally connect the hemispheres are limited in their growth in HD by microtubule bundling defects within the axonal growth cone, so that fewer axons cross the corpus callosum. Proteomic analyses of the growth cones revealed that NUMA1 (nuclear/mitotic apparatus protein 1) is downregulated in HD by miR-124. Suppressing NUMA1 in wild-type cells recapitulates the microtubule and axonal growth defects of HD, whereas raising NUMA1 levels with antagomiR-124 or stabilizing microtubules with epothilone B restores microtubule organization and rescues axonal growth. NUMA1 therefore regulates the microtubule network in the growth cone, and HD, which is traditionally conceived as a disease of intracellular trafficking, also disturbs the cytoskeletal network.
PXD025730	34793950	Insight in the quorum sensing-driven lifestyle of the non-pathogenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens 6N2 and the interactions with the yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii. 	Insight in the quorum sensing-driven lifestyle of the non-pathogenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens 6N2 and the interactions with the yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii	DUAL CULTURE, ENDOPHYTIC, INTERACTION, PURE CULTURE, QUORUM SENSING	Agrobacterium tumefaciens is considered a prominent phytopathogen, though most isolates are nonpathogenic. Agrobacteria can inhabit plant tissues interacting with other microorganisms. Yeasts are likewise part of these communities. We analyzed the quorum sensing (QS) systems of A. tumefaciens strain 6N2, and its relevance for the interaction with the yeast Meyerozyma guilliermondii, both sugarcane endophytes. We show that strain 6N2 is nonpathogenic, produces OHC8-HSL, OHC10-HSL, OC12-HSL and OHC12-HSL as QS signals, and possesses a complex QS architecture, with one truncated, two complete systems, and three additional QS-signal receptors. A proteomic approach showed differences in QS-regulated proteins between pure (64 proteins) and dual (33 proteins) cultures. Seven proteins were consistently regulated by quorum sensing in pure and dual cultures. M. guilliermondii proteins influenced by QS activity were also evaluated. Several up- and down- regulated proteins differed depending on the bacterial QS. These results show the QS regulation in the bacteria-yeast interactions.
PXD023574	34793982	Comparative Proteome Signatures of Trace Samples by Multiplexed Data-Independent Acquisition. 	Comparative proteome signatures of trace samples by multiplexed Data-Independent Acquisition	DIA-TMT, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, Ultra-low input samples, identification-independent	Single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of basic biology and disease. Since transcript levels often do not correlate with protein expression, it is crucial to complement transcriptomics approaches with proteome analyses at single-cell resolution. Despite continuous technological improvements in sensitivity, mass-spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics ultimately faces the challenge of reproducibly comparing the protein expression profiles of thousands of individual cells. Here, we combine two hitherto opposing analytical strategies, DIA and Tandem-Mass-Tag (TMT)-multiplexing, to generate highly reproducible, quantitative proteome signatures from ultralow input samples. We developed a novel, identification-independent proteomics data-analysis pipeline that allows to quantitatively compare DIA-TMT proteome signatures across hundreds of samples independent of their biological origin to identify cell types and single protein knockouts. These proteome signatures overcome the need to impute quantitative data due to accumulating detrimental amounts of missing data in standard multibatch TMT experiments. We validate our approach using integrative data analysis of different human cell lines and standard database searches for knockouts of defined proteins. Our data establish a novel and reproducible approach to markedly expand the numbers of proteins one detects from ultralow input samples.
PXD027157	34793984	Rice GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE1-mediated oxidation of bZIP68 positively regulates ABA-independent osmotic stress signaling. 	glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) interactome	GPX1, Oryza sativa, PPI, glutathione peroxidase, osmotic stress, transcription control	Osmotic stress caused by drought and high salinity is a significant environmental threat that limits plant growth and agricultural yield. Redox regulation plays an important role in plant stress responses, but the mechanisms by which plants perceive and transduce redox signals are still underexplored. Here, we report a critical function for the thiol peroxidase GPX1 in osmotic stress response in rice, where it serves as a redox sensor and transducer. GPX1 is quickly oxidized upon exposure to osmotic stress and forms an intramolecular disulfide bond, which is required for the activation of bZIP68, a VRE-like basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor involved in the ABA-independent osmotic stress response pathway. The disulfide exchange between GPX1 and bZIP68 induces homo-tetramerization of bZIP68 and thus positively regulates osmotic stress response by regulating osmotic-responsive gene expression. Furthermore, we discovered that the nuclear translocation of GPX1 is regulated by its acetylation under osmotic stress. Taken together, our findings not only uncover the redox regulation of the GPX1-bZIP68 module during osmotic stress but also highlight the coordination of protein acetylation and redox signaling in plant osmotic stress responses.
PXD022881	34794390	Combined proteomic/transcriptomic signature of recurrence post-liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma beyond Milan. 	Combined Protein Signature of ALDH1A1, LGALS3, LGALS3BP Predicts Cancer Recurrence Post-Liver Transplantation Beyond Milan Hepatocellular Carcinoma	Galectin, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Liver, Recurrence	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver transplantation (LT) can be offered to patients with Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond Milan criteria. However, there are currently limited molecular markers on HCC explant histology to predict recurrence, which arises in up to 20% of LT recipients. The goal of our study was to derive a combined proteomic/transcriptomic signature on HCC explant predictive of recurrence post-transplant using unbiased, high-throughput approaches. METHODS: Patients who received a LT for HCC beyond Milan criteria in the context of hepatitis B cirrhosis were identified. Tumor explants from patients with post-transplant HCC recurrence (N = 7) versus those without recurrence (N = 4) were analyzed by mass spectrometry and gene expression array. Univariate analysis was used to generate a combined proteomic/transcriptomic signature linked to recurrence. Significantly predictive genes and proteins were verified and internally validated by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Seventy-nine proteins and 636 genes were significantly differentially expressed in HCC tumors with subsequent recurrence (p < 0.05). Univariate survival analysis identified Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family Member A1 (ALDH1A1) gene (HR = 0.084, 95%CI 0.01-0.68, p = 0.0152), ALDH1A1 protein (HR = 0.039, 95%CI 0.16-0.91, p = 0.03), Galectin 3 Binding Protein (LGALS3BP) gene (HR = 7.14, 95%CI 1.20-432.96, p = 0.03), LGALS3BP protein (HR = 2.6, 95%CI 1.1-6.1, p = 0.036), Galectin 3 (LGALS3) gene (HR = 2.89, 95%CI 1.01-8.3, p = 0.049) and LGALS3 protein (HR = 2.6, 95%CI 1.2-5.5, p = 0.015) as key dysregulated analytes in recurrent HCC. In concordance with our proteome findings, HCC recurrence was linked to decreased ALDH1A1 and increased LGALS3 protein expression by Western Blot. LGALS3BP protein expression was validated in 29 independent HCC samples. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly increased LGALS3 and LGALS3BP gene and protein expression on explant were associated with post-transplant recurrence, whereas increased ALDH1A1 was associated with absence of recurrence in patients transplanted for HCC beyond Milan criteria. This combined proteomic/transcriptomic signature could help in predicting HCC recurrence risk and guide post-transplant surveillance.
PXD029082	34795224	Proteogenomic discovery of neoantigens facilitates personalized multi-antigen targeted T cell immunotherapy for brain tumors. 	Proteogenomic Discovery of Neoantigens Facilitates Personalized Multi-antigen Targeted T cell Immunotherapy for Brain Tumors	Medulloblastoma, Pediatric Brain Tumors	Neoantigen discovery in pediatric brain tumors is hampered by their low mutational burden and scant tissue availability. Here we develop a proteogenomic approach combining tumor DNA/RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics to identify tumor-restricted (neoantigen) peptides arising from multiple genomic aberrations to generate a highly target-specific, autologous, personalized T cell immunotherapy. Our data indicate that aberrant splice junctions are the primary source of neoantigens in medulloblastoma, a common pediatric brain tumor. Proteogenomically identified tumor-specific peptides are immunogenic and generate MHC II-based T cell responses. Moreover, polyclonal and polyfunctional T cells specific for tumor-specific peptides effectively eliminate tumor cells in vitro. Targeting tumor-specific antigens obviates the issue of central immune tolerance while potentially providing a safety margin favoring combination with other immune-activating therapies. These findings demonstrate the proteogenomic discovery of immunogenic tumor-specific peptides and lay the groundwork for personalized targeted T cell therapies for children with brain tumors.
PXD028601	34795227	DeepPhospho accelerates DIA phosphoproteome profiling through in silico library generation. 	DeepPhospho generated libraries, search results, models, and synthetic data	DeepPhospho	Phosphoproteomics integrating data-independent acquisition (DIA) enables deep phosphoproteome profiling with improved quantification reproducibility and accuracy compared to data-dependent acquisition (DDA)-based phosphoproteomics. DIA data mining heavily relies on a spectral library that in most cases is built on DDA analysis of the same sample. Construction of this project-specific DDA library impairs the analytical throughput, limits the proteome coverage, and increases the sample size for DIA phosphoproteomics. Herein we introduce a deep neural network, DeepPhospho, which conceptually differs from previous deep learning models to achieve accurate predictions of LC-MS/MS data for phosphopeptides. By leveraging in silico libraries generated by DeepPhospho, we establish a DIA workflow for phosphoproteome profiling which involves DIA data acquisition and data mining with DeepPhospho predicted libraries, thus circumventing the need of DDA library construction. Our DeepPhospho-empowered workflow substantially expands the phosphoproteome coverage while maintaining high quantification performance, which leads to the discovery of more signaling pathways and regulated kinases in an EGF signaling study than the DDA library-based approach. DeepPhospho is provided as a web server as well as an offline app to facilitate user access to model training, predictions and library generation.
PXD021770	34795231	Identification of proximal SUMO-dependent interactors using SUMO-ID. 	Identification of proximal SUMO-dependent interactors using SUMO-ID	BioID, PML, SUMO, TurboID, protein-protein interaction	The fast dynamics and reversibility of posttranslational modifications by the ubiquitin family pose significant challenges for research. Here we present SUMO-ID, a technology that merges proximity biotinylation by TurboID and protein-fragment complementation to find SUMO-dependent interactors of proteins of interest. We develop an optimized split-TurboID version and show SUMO interaction-dependent labelling of proteins proximal to PML and RANGAP1. SUMO-dependent interactors of PML are involved in transcription, DNA damage, stress response and SUMO modification and are highly enriched in SUMO Interacting Motifs, but may only represent a subset of the total PML proximal proteome. Likewise, SUMO-ID also allow us to identify interactors of SUMOylated SALL1, a less characterized SUMO substrate. Furthermore, using TP53 as a substrate, we identify SUMO1, SUMO2 and Ubiquitin preferential interactors. Thus, SUMO-ID is a powerful tool that allows to study the consequences of SUMO-dependent interactions, and may further unravel the complexity of the ubiquitin code.
PXD025770	34795242	Smooth muscle-specific MMP17 (MT4-MMP) regulates the intestinal stem cell niche and regeneration after damage. 	Smooth muscle-specific MMP17 (MT4-MMP) defines the intestinal ECM niche	MMP17, smooth muscle	Smooth muscle is an essential component of the intestine, both to maintain its structure and produce peristaltic and segmentation movements. However, very little is known about other putative roles that smooth muscle cells may have. Here, we show that smooth muscle cells may be the dominant suppliers of BMP antagonists, which are niche factors essential for intestinal stem cell maintenance. Furthermore, muscle-derived factors render epithelium reparative and fetal-like, which includes heightened YAP activity. Mechanistically, we find that the membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase MMP17, which is exclusively expressed by smooth muscle cells, is required for intestinal epithelial repair after inflammation- or irradiation-induced injury. Furthermore, we propose that MMP17 affects intestinal epithelial reprogramming after damage indirectly by cleaving diffusible factor(s) such as the matricellular protein PERIOSTIN. Together, we identify an important signaling axis that establishes a role for smooth muscle cells as modulators of intestinal epithelial regeneration and the intestinal stem cell niche.
PXD021891	34795246	Mapping protein carboxymethylation sites provides insights into their role in proteostasis and cell proliferation. 	Mapping sites of carboxymethyllysine modification on proteins reveals consequences for proteostasis and cell proliferation	acetylation, advanced glycation end products, aging, carboxymethyllysine, cell cycle, endothelial cell, glyoxal, heart, kidney, liver, mice, microtubules, mitosis, posttranslational modification, proteasome, tubulin	Posttranslational mechanisms play a key role in modifying the abundance and function of cellular proteins. Among these, modification by advanced glycation end products has been shown to accumulate during aging and age-associated diseases but specific protein targets and functional consequences remain largely unexplored. Here, we devise a proteomic strategy to identify sites of carboxymethyllysine modification, one of the most abundant advanced glycation end products. We identify over 1000 sites of protein carboxymethylation in mouse and primary human cells treated with the glycating agent glyoxal. By using quantitative proteomics, we find that protein glycation triggers a proteotoxic response and indirectly affects the protein degradation machinery. In primary endothelial cells, we show that glyoxal induces cell cycle perturbation and that carboxymethyllysine modification reduces acetylation of tubulins and impairs microtubule dynamics. Our data demonstrate the relevance of carboxymethyllysine modification for cellular function and pinpoint specific protein networks that might become compromised during aging.
PXD026580	34795260	HPF1 dynamically controls the PARP1/2 balance between initiating and elongating ADP-ribose modifications. 	HXMS on PARP1+DNA+HPF1 to study the dynamics of PARP1	DNA, HPF1, HXMS, PARP1	PARP1 and PARP2 produce poly(ADP-ribose) in response to DNA breaks. HPF1 regulates PARP1/2 catalytic output, most notably permitting serine modification with ADP-ribose. However, PARP1 is substantially more abundant in cells than HPF1, challenging whether HPF1 can pervasively modulate PARP1. Here, we show biochemically that HPF1 efficiently regulates PARP1/2 catalytic output at sub-stoichiometric ratios matching their relative cellular abundances. HPF1 rapidly associates/dissociates from multiple PARP1 molecules, initiating serine modification before modification initiates on glutamate/aspartate, and accelerating initiation to be more comparable to elongation reactions forming poly(ADP-ribose). This "hit and run" mechanism ensures HPF1 contributions to PARP1/2 during initiation do not persist and interfere with PAR chain elongation. We provide structural insights into HPF1/PARP1 assembled on a DNA break, and assess HPF1 impact on PARP1 retention on DNA. Our data support the prevalence of serine-ADP-ribose modification in cells and the efficiency of serine-ADP-ribose modification required for an acute DNA damage response.
PXD025314	34795272	Phosphorylation activates the yeast small heat shock protein Hsp26 by weakening domain contacts in the oligomer ensemble. 	Phosphorylation activates the yeast small heat shock protein Hsp26 by weakening domain contacts in the oligomer ensemble	Hsp26, phosphorylation, sHsp	Hsp26 is a small heat shock protein (sHsp) from S. cerevisiae. Its chaperone activity is activated by oligomer dissociation at heat shock temperatures. Hsp26 contains 9 phosphorylation sites in different structural elements. Our analysis of phospho-mimetic mutations shows that phosphorylation activates Hsp26 at permissive temperatures. The cryo-EM structure of the Hsp26 40mer revealed contacts between the conserved core domain of Hsp26 and the so-called thermosensor domain in the N-terminal part of the protein, which are targeted by phosphorylation. Furthermore, several phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal extension, which link subunits within the oligomer, are sensitive to the introduction of negative charges. In all cases, the intrinsic inhibition of chaperone activity is relieved and the N-terminal domain becomes accessible for substrate protein binding. The weakening of domain interactions within and between subunits by phosphorylation to activate the chaperone activity in response to proteotoxic stresses independent of heat stress could be a general regulation principle of sHsps.
PXD026017	34795302	Acyl carrier protein promotes MukBEF action in Escherichia coli chromosome organization-segregation. 	Identification of MukBHN conformational changes upon AcpP binding using cross-linking mass spectrometry	AcpP, MukB, Structural maintenance of chromosome, cross-linking mass spectrometry	Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes act ubiquitously to compact DNA linearly, thereby facilitating chromosome organization-segregation. SMC proteins have a conserved architecture, with a dimerization hinge and an ATPase head domain separated by a long antiparallel intramolecular coiled-coil. Dimeric SMC proteins interact with essential accessory proteins, kleisins that bridge the two subunits of an SMC dimer, and HAWK/KITE proteins that interact with kleisins. The ATPase activity of the Escherichia coli SMC protein, MukB, which is essential for its in vivo function, requires its interaction with the dimeric kleisin, MukF that in turn interacts with the KITE protein, MukE. Here we demonstrate that, in addition, MukB interacts specifically with Acyl Carrier Protein (AcpP) that has essential functions in fatty acid synthesis. We characterize the AcpP interaction at the joint of the MukB coiled-coil and show that the interaction is necessary for MukB ATPase and for MukBEF function in vivo.
PXD021821	34796338	Enhanced epigenetic profiling of classical human monocytes reveals a specific signature of healthy aging in the DNA methylome. 	Enhanced epigenetic profiling of classical human monocytes reveals a specific signature of healthy aging in the DNA methylome	Aging, Monocyte	The impact of healthy aging on molecular programming of immune cells is poorly understood. Here, we report comprehensive characterization of healthy aging in human classical monocytes, with a focus on epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations, as well as the corresponding proteomic and metabolomic data for plasma, using healthy cohorts of 20 young and 20 older males (~27 and ~64 years old on average). For each individual, we performed eRRBS-based DNA methylation profiling, which allowed us to identify a set of age-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) - a novel, cell-type specific signature of aging in DNA methylome. Hypermethylation events were associated with H3K27me3 in the CpG islands near promoters of lowly-expressed genes, while hypomethylated DMRs were enriched in H3K4me1 marked regions and associated with age-related increase of expression of the corresponding genes, providing a link between DNA methylation and age-associated transcriptional changes in primary human cells.
PXD027772	34796900	A scalable, clinically severe pig model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 	A scalable, clinically severe pig model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy	DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, animal model, pig	Large-animal models for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are crucial for the evaluation of diagnostic procedures and treatment strategies. Pigs cloned from male cells lacking DMD exon 52 (DMDDelta52) exhibit molecular, clinical and pathological hallmarks of DMD, but die before sexual maturity and cannot be propagated by breeding. Therefore, we generated female DMD+/- carriers. A single founder animal had 11 litters with 29 DMDY/-, 34 DMD+/- as well as 36 male and 29 female wild-type offspring. Breeding with F1 and F2 DMD+/- carriers resulted in an additional 114 DMDY/- piglets. With intensive neonatal management, the majority survived for 3-4 months, providing statistically relevant cohorts for experimental studies. Pathological investigations and proteome studies of skeletal muscles and myocardium confirmed the resemblance to human disease mechanisms. Importantly, DMDY/- pigs displayed progressive myocardial fibrosis and increased expression of connexin-43, associated with significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, at 3 months. Furthermore, behavioral tests provided evidence for impaired cognitive ability. Our breeding cohort of DMDDelta52 pigs and standardized tissue repositories provide important resources for studying DMD disease mechanisms and for testing novel treatment strategies.
PXD025835	34798813	Systematic analysis of the lysine malonylome in Sanghuangporus sanghuang. 	Systematic analysis of the lysine malonylome in Sanghuangporus sanghuang	Malonylation, Malonylproteome, Post-translational modification (PTM), Sanghuangporus sanghuang	BACKGROUND: Sanghuangporus sanghuang is a well-known traditional medicinal mushroom associated with mulberry. Despite the properties of this mushroom being known for many years, the regulatory mechanisms of bioactive compound biosynthesis in this medicinal mushroom are still unclear. Lysine malonylation is a posttranslational modification that has many critical functions in various aspects of cell metabolism. However, at present we do not know its role in S. sanghuang. In this study, a global investigation of the lysine malonylome in S. sanghuang was therefore carried out. RESULTS: In total, 714 malonyl modification sites were matched to 255 different proteins. The analysis indicated that malonyl modifications were involved in a wide range of cellular functions and displayed a distinct subcellular localization. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that malonylated proteins were engaged in different metabolic pathways, including glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Notably, a total of 26 enzymes related to triterpene and polysaccharide biosynthesis were found to be malonylated, indicating an indispensable role of lysine malonylation in bioactive compound biosynthesis in S. sanghuang. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that malonylation is associated with many metabolic pathways, particularly the metabolism of the bioactive compounds triterpene and polysaccharide. This paper represents the first comprehensive survey of malonylation in S. sanghuang and provides important data for further study on the physiological function of lysine malonylation in S. sanghuang and other medicinal mushrooms.
PXD025410	34799561	Large scale discovery of coronavirus-host factor protein interaction motifs reveals SARS-CoV-2 specific mechanisms and vulnerabilities. 	Large scale discovery of coronavirus-host factor protein interaction motifs reveals SARS-CoV-2 disease specific mechanisms and vulnerabilities.	Covid-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, SARS-CoV2, protein interaction	Viral proteins make extensive use of short peptide interaction motifs to hijack cellular host factors. However, most current large-scale methods do not identify this important class of protein-protein interactions. Uncovering peptide mediated interactions provides both a molecular understanding of viral interactions with their host and the foundation for developing novel antiviral reagents. Here we describe a viral peptide discovery approach covering 23 coronavirus strains that provides high resolution information on direct virus-host interactions. We identify 269 peptide-based interactions for 18 coronaviruses including a specific interaction between the human G3BP1/2 proteins and an PhixFG peptide motif in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein. This interaction supports viral replication and through its PhixFG motif N rewires the G3BP1/2 interactome to disrupt stress granules. A peptide-based inhibitor disrupting the G3BP1/2-N interaction dampened SARS-CoV-2 infection showing that our results can be directly translated into novel specific antiviral reagents.
PXD027787	34799735	A proteome-wide map of 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol interactors in cell membranes. 	A proteome-wide map of 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol interactors in cell membranes	Cancer, Chemoproteomics Probe, Immune Response, Live-cell Analysis, Osteogenic Molecules, Oxysterols	Oxysterols (OHCs) are hydroxylated cholesterol metabolites that play ubiquitous roles in health and disease. Due to the non-covalent nature of their interactions and their unique partitioning in membranes, the analysis of live-cell, proteome-wide interactions of OHCs remains an unmet challenge. Here, we present a structurally precise chemoproteomics probe for the biologically active molecule 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (20(S)-OHC) and provide a map of its proteome-wide targets in the membranes of living cells. Our target catalog consolidates diverse OHC ontologies and demonstrates that OHC-interacting proteins cluster with specific processes in immune response and cancer. Competition experiments reveal that 20(S)-OHC is a chemo-, regio- and stereoselective ligand for the protein transmembrane protein 97 (Tmem97/the sigma2 receptor), enabling us to reconstruct the 20(S)-OHC-Tmem97 binding site. Our results demonstrate that multiplexed, quantitative analysis of cellular target engagement can expose new dimensions of metabolite activity and identify actionable targets for molecular therapy.
PXD049071	34799972	A prostate cancer tissue specific spectral library for targeted proteomic analysis. 	[HPP-2.0] Prostate cancer specific library including 125 injections	FFPE, Prostate cancer, SWATH spectral library, highph fraction	Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males worldwide. Mass spectrometry-based targeted proteomics has demonstrated great potential in quantifying proteins from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and (fresh) frozen biopsy tissues. Here we provide a comprehensive tissue-specific spectral library for targeted proteomic analysis of prostate tissue samples. Benign and malignant FFPE prostate tissue samples were processed into peptide samples by pressure cycling technology (PCT)-assisted sample preparation, and fractionated with high-pH reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Based on data-dependent acquisition (DDA) MS analysis using a TripleTOF 6600, we built a library containing 108,533 precursors, 84,198 peptides and 9384 unique proteins (1% FDR). The applicability of the library was demonstrated in prostate specimens.
PXD023520	34800266	PINK1 kinase dysfunction triggers neurodegeneration in the primate brain without impacting mitochondrial homeostasis. 	Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of  monkey brains with PINK1 depletion	PINK1 Monkey Proteome Phosphoproteome	In vitro studies have established the prevalent theory that the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 protects neurodegeneration by removing damaged mitochondria in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, difficulty in detecting endogenous PINK1 protein in rodent brains and cell lines has prevented the rigorous investigation of the in vivo role of PINK1. Here we report that PINK1 kinase form is selectively expressed in the human and monkey brains. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deficiency of PINK1 causes similar neurodegeneration in the brains of fetal and adult monkeys as well as cultured monkey neurons without affecting mitochondrial protein expression and morphology. Importantly, PINK1 mutations in the primate brain and human cells reduce protein phosphorylation that is important for neuronal function and survival. Our findings suggest that PINK1 kinase activity rather than its mitochondrial function is essential for the neuronal survival in the primate brains and that its kinase dysfunction could be involved in the pathogenesis of PD.
PXD028044	34801069	Overexpression of Lin28A in neural progenitor cells in vivo does not lead to brain tumor formation but results in reduced spine density. 	Overexpression of Lin28A in neural progenitor cells in vivo does not lead to brain tumor formation but results in reduced spine density	DDA DIA LC-MS/MS, ETMR, Lin28A, Phosphopetide	LIN28A overexpression has been identified in malignant brain tumors called embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) but its specific role during brain development remains largely unknown. Radial glia cells of the ventricular zone (VZ) are proposed as a cell of origin for ETMR. We asked whether an overexpression of LIN28A in such cells might affect brain development or result in the formation of brain tumors.Constitutive overexpression of LIN28A in hGFAP-cre::lsl-Lin28A (GL) mice led to a transient increase of proliferation in the cortical VZ at embryonic stages but no postnatal brain tumor formation. Postnatally, GL mice displayed a pyramidal cell layer dispersion of the hippocampus and altered spine and dendrite morphology, including reduced dendritic spine densities in the hippocampus and cortex. GL mice displayed hyperkinetic activity and differential quantitative MS-based proteomics revealed altered time dependent molecular functions regarding mRNA processing and spine morphogenesis. Phosphoproteomic analyses indicated a downregulation of mTOR pathway modulated proteins such as Map1b being involved in microtubule dynamics.In conclusion, we show that Lin28A overexpression transiently increases proliferation of neural precursor cells but it is not sufficient to drive brain tumors in vivo. In contrast, Lin28A impacts on protein abundancy patterns related to spine morphogenesis and phosphorylation levels of proteins involved in microtubule dynamics, resulting in decreased spine densities of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex as well as in altered behavior. Our work provides new insights into the role of LIN28A for neuronal morphogenesis and development and may reveal future targets for treatment of ETMR patients.

Complement C4-A and Plasminogen Q1 Q2 as Potential Biomarkers for Prediction of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma	biomarker, complement C4-A, papillary thyroid carcinoma, plasminogen, prediction	Background: Early diagnosis and therapy of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is essential for reducing recurrence and improving the long-term survival. In this study, we aimed to investigate the proteome profile of plasma and screen unique proteins which could be used as a biomarker for predicting PTC. Methods: Serum samples were collected from 29 PTC patients and 29 nodular goiter (NG) patients. Five PTC serum samples and five NG serum samples were selected for proteome profiles by proteomics. Eight proteins in PTC and NG serum samples were selected for confirmation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curves was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of potential biomarkers. Results: Complement C4-A (C4A) and plasminogen (PLG) were significantly lower in serum samples of PTC patients compared with NG patients. C4A was observed to have excellent diagnostic accuracy for PTC, with a sensitivity of 91.67% and specificity of 83.33%. The diagnostic value of PLG for PTC was demonstrated by a sensitivity at 87.50% and specificity at 75.00%. The AUC for C4A and PLG was 0.97 +/- 0.02 and 0.89 +/- 0.05. Conclusion: C4A and PLG appeared to be excellent potential biomarkers for the prediction of PTC.
PXD025418	34804081	Integrated Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analysis in the Roadmap of the Xylem Development Stage in Populus tomentosa. 	proteomic analysis of the xylem development stage in Populus tomentosa	Populus, xylem development	Xylem development plays an important role in the wood formation of plants. In this study, we found that xylem development was a rapid thickening process characterized by initially rapid increases in the number of tracheary elements and fiber cells and the thickness of the secondary walls that later plateaued. Transcriptome analysis showed that the xylan and lignin biosynthetic pathways, which are involved in the early rapid thickening of the xylem, were mainly upregulated in the second month. The expression of a total of 124 transcription factors (TFs), including 28 NAC TFs and 31 MYB TFs, peaked in 2- and 3-month-old plants compared with 1-month-old plants. Based on previous studies and the key cis-acting elements secondary wall NAC-binding elements, secondary wall MYB-responsive elements, W-box and TGTG[T/G/C], 10 TFs related to xylem development, 50 TFs with unknown function, 98 cell wall biosynthetic genes, and 47 programmed cell death (PCD) genes were used to construct a four-layer transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) with poplar NAC domain TFs to characterize the transcriptional regulation of cell wall biosynthesis and PCD in Populus tomentosa. The proteome revealed that post-transcriptional modification may be widely involved in lignification development. Overall, our results revealed that xylem development is a rapid thickening process in P. tomentosa, and expression patterns varied temporally from cell division to cell death.
PXD027130	34804992	Proteome Profiling of RNF213 Depleted Cells Reveals Nitric Oxide Regulator DDAH1 Antilisterial Activity. 	Proteome profiling of RNF213 depleted cells reveals nitric oxide regulator DDAH1 antilisterial activity	DDAH1, Listeria, Listeria monocytogenes, RNF213, bacteria, infection, nitric oxide	RNF213 is a large, poorly characterized interferon-induced protein. Mutations in RNF213 are associated with predisposition for Moyamoya disease (MMD), a rare cerebrovascular disorder. Recently, RNF213 was found to have broad antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo, yet the molecular mechanisms behind this function remain unclear. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and validation by real-time PCR we report here that knockdown of RNF213 leads to transcriptional upregulation of MVP and downregulation of CYR61, in line with reported pro- and anti-bacterial activities of these proteins. Knockdown of RNF213 also results in downregulation of DDAH1, which we discover to exert antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes infection. DDAH1 regulates production of nitric oxide (NO), a molecule with both vascular and antimicrobial effects. We show that NO production is reduced in macrophages from RNF213 KO mice, suggesting that RNF213 controls Listeria infection through regulation of DDAH1 transcription and production of NO. Our findings propose a potential mechanism for the antilisterial activity of RNF213 and highlight NO as a potential link between RNF213-mediated immune responses and the development of MMD.
PXD024135	34806902	Extracellular Matrix in Heart Failure: Role of ADAMTS5 in Proteoglycan Remodeling. 	Extracellular Matrix Proteomics of Human Heart Failure.	Ischaemic heart failure, LC-MSMS., cardiac tissue, extracellular matrix	BACKGROUND: Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a hallmark of heart failure (HF). Our previous analysis of the secretome of murine cardiac fibroblasts returned ADAMTS5 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5) as one of the most abundant proteases. ADAMTS5 cleaves chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans such as versican. The contribution of ADAMTS5 and its substrate versican to HF is unknown. METHODS: Versican remodeling was assessed in mice lacking the catalytic domain of ADAMTS5 (Adamts5(DeltaCat)). Proteomics was applied to study ECM remodeling in left ventricular samples from patients with HF, with a particular focus on the effects of common medications used for the treatment of HF. RESULTS: Versican and versikine, an ADAMTS-specific versican cleavage product, accumulated in patients with ischemic HF. Versikine was also elevated in a porcine model of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury and in murine hearts after angiotensin II infusion. In Adamts5(DeltaCat) mice, angiotensin II infusion resulted in an aggravated versican build-up and hyaluronic acid disarrangement, accompanied by reduced levels of integrin beta1, filamin A, and connexin 43. Echocardiographic assessment of Adamts5(DeltaCat) mice revealed a reduced ejection fraction and an impaired global longitudinal strain on angiotensin II infusion. Cardiac hypertrophy and collagen deposition were similar to littermate controls. In a proteomics analysis of a larger cohort of cardiac explants from patients with ischemic HF (n=65), the use of beta-blockers was associated with a reduction in ECM deposition, with versican being among the most pronounced changes. Subsequent experiments in cardiac fibroblasts confirmed that beta1-adrenergic receptor stimulation increased versican expression. Despite similar clinical characteristics, patients with HF treated with beta-blockers had a distinct cardiac ECM profile. CONCLUSIONS: Our results in animal models and patients suggest that ADAMTS proteases are critical for versican degradation in the heart and that versican accumulation is associated with impaired cardiac function. A comprehensive characterization of the cardiac ECM in patients with ischemic HF revealed that beta-blockers may have a previously unrecognized beneficial effect on cardiac chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan content.
PXD026886	34807614	Median-Based Absolute Quantification of Proteins Using Fully Unlabeled Generic Internal Standard (FUGIS). 	Median Based Absolute Quantification using Fully Unlabelled Generic Internal Standard	Absolute quantification	By reporting the molar abundance of proteins, absolute quantification determines their stoichiometry in complexes, pathways, or networks. Typically, absolute quantification relies either on protein-specific isotopically labeled peptide standards or on a semiempirical calibration against the average abundance of peptides chosen from arbitrarily selected proteins. In contrast, a generic protein standard FUGIS (fully unlabeled generic internal standard) requires no isotopic labeling, chemical synthesis, or external calibration and is applicable to quantifying proteins of any organismal origin. The median intensity of the peptide peaks produced by the tryptic digestion of FUGIS is used as a single-point calibrant to determine the molar abundance of any codigested protein. Powered by FUGIS, median-based absolute quantification (MBAQ) outperformed other methods of untargeted proteome-wide absolute quantification.
PXD021884	34808356	Metabolic Enzyme Alterations and Astrocyte Dysfunction in a Murine Model of Alexander Disease With Severe Reactive Gliosis. 	Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of an Alexander Disease Murine Model with Severe Reactive Gliosis	Alexander disease, brain proteome, data-independent acquisition, parallel reaction monitoring, reactive gliosis	Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In this report, a mouse model of AxD (GFAP(Tg);Gfap(+/R236H)) was analyzed that contains a heterozygous R236H point mutation in murine Gfap as well as a transgene with a GFAP promoter to overexpress human GFAP. Using label-free quantitative proteomic comparisons of brain tissue from GFAP(Tg);Gfap(+/R236H) versus wild-type mice confirmed upregulation of the glutathione metabolism pathway and indicated proteins were elevated in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, which had not been reported previously in AxD. Relative protein-level differences were confirmed by a targeted proteomics assay, including proteins related to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Of particular interest was the decreased level of the oligodendrocyte protein, 2-hydroxyacylsphingosine 1-beta-galactosyltransferase (Ugt8), since Ugt8-deficient mice exhibit a phenotype similar to GFAP(Tg);Gfap(+/R236H) mice (e.g., tremors, ataxia, hind-limb paralysis). In addition, decreased levels of myelin-associated proteins were found in the GFAP(Tg);Gfap(+/R236H) mice, consistent with the role of Ugt8 in myelin synthesis. Fabp7 upregulation in GFAP(Tg);Gfap(+/R236H) mice was also selected for further investigation due to its uncharacterized association to AxD, critical function in astrocyte proliferation, and functional ability to inhibit the anti-inflammatory PPAR signaling pathway in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Within Gfap(+) astrocytes, Fabp7 was markedly increased in the hippocampus, a brain region subjected to extensive pathology and chronic reactive gliosis in GFAP(Tg);Gfap(+/R236H) mice. Last, to determine whether the findings in GFAP(Tg);Gfap(+/R236H) mice are present in the human condition, AxD patient and control samples were analyzed by Western blot, which indicated that Type I AxD patients have a significant fourfold upregulation of FABP7. However, immunohistochemistry analysis showed that UGT8 accumulates in AxD patient subpial brain regions where abundant amounts of Rosenthal fibers are located, which was not observed in the GFAP(Tg);Gfap(+/R236H) mice.
PXD024159	34809447	Neutrophil-Derived Protein S100A8/A9 Alters the Platelet Proteome in Acute Myocardial Infarction and Is Associated With Changes in Platelet Reactivity. 	Transfer of Alarmins from Neutrophils to Platelets after Acute Myocardial Infarction	Atherosclerosis and Ischemic Disease, Cellular Hemostasis and Platelets, Q Exactive HF	OBJECTIVE: Platelets are central to acute myocardial infarction (MI). How the platelet proteome is altered during MI is unknown. We sought to describe changes in the platelet proteome during MI and identify corresponding functional consequences. Approach and Results: Platelets from patients experiencing ST-segment-elevation MI (STEMI) before and 3 days after treatment (n=30) and matched patients with severe stable coronary artery disease before and 3 days after coronary artery bypass grafting (n=25) underwent quantitative proteomic analysis. Elevations in the proteins S100A8 and S100A9 were detected at the time of STEMI compared with stable coronary artery disease (S100A8: FC, 2.00; false discovery rate, 0.05; S100A9: FC, 2.28; false discovery rate, 0.005). During STEMI, only S100A8 mRNA and protein levels were correlated in platelets (R=0.46, P=0.012). To determine whether de novo protein synthesis occurs, activated platelets were incubated with 13C-labeled amino acids for 24 hours and analyzed by mass spectrometry. No incorporation was confidently detected. Platelet S100A8 and S100A9 was strongly correlated with neutrophil abundance at the time of STEMI. When isolated platelets and neutrophils were coincubated under quiescent and activated conditions, release of S100A8 from neutrophils resulted in uptake of S100A8 by platelets. Neutrophils released S100A8/A9 as free heterodimer, rather than in vesicles or extracellular traps. In the community-based Bruneck study (n=338), plasma S100A8/A9 was inversely associated with platelet reactivity-an effect abrogated by aspirin. CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte-to-platelet protein transfer may occur in a thromboinflammatory environment such as STEMI. Plasma S100A8/A9 was negatively associated with platelet reactivity. These findings highlight neutrophils as potential modifiers for thrombotic therapies in coronary artery disease.
PXD027326	34811625	Effect of Insulin Receptor-Knockdown on the Expression Levels of Blood-Brain Barrier Functional Proteins in Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells. 	Brain microvascular endothelial cells: INSR KD	SWATH, brain barrier, insulin receptor	PURPOSE: The insulin receptor (INSR) mediates insulin signaling to modulate cellular functions. Although INSR is expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), its role in the modulation of BBB function is poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to analyze the effect of INSR knockdown on the expression levels of functional proteins at the BBB. METHODS: We established the INSR-knockdown cell line (shINSR) using human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3). The cellular proteome was analyzed using quantitative proteomics. RESULTS: INSR mRNA and protein expressions were decreased in shINSR cells. The suppression of INSR-mediated signaling in shINSR cells was evaluated. The proteins involved in glycolysis and glycogenolysis were suppressed in shINSR cells. As amyloid-beta peptide-related proteins, the expressions of presenilin-1 was increased, and those of the insulin-degrading enzyme and neprilysin were decreased. The expressions of BBB transporters, including the ABCB1/MDR1, ABCG2/BCRP, and SLCO2A1/OATP2A1 were significantly decreased by more than 50% in shINSR cells. The efflux activity of ABCB1/MDR1 was also suppressed. The expressions of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 were significantly increased, and those of the transferrin receptor were significantly decreased in shINSR cells. The expression of claudin-5 was also suppressed in shINSR cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that INSR-mediated signaling is involved in the regulation of functional protein expression at the BBB and contributes to the maintenance of BBB function. Changes in the expressions of amyloid-beta peptide-related proteins may contribute to the development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy via the suppression of INSR-mediated signaling.
PXD022390	34813325	Evaluation of Differential Peptide Loading on Tandem Mass Tag-Based Proteomic and Phosphoproteomic Data Quality. 	Evaluation of differential peptide loading on TMT-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic data quality	AML, TMT, clinical proteomics, phosphoproteomics	Global and phosphoproteome profiling has demonstrated great utility for the analysis of clinical specimens. One barrier to the broad clinical application of proteomic profiling is the large amount of biological material required, particularly for phosphoproteomics-currently on the order of 25 mg wet tissue weight. For hematopoietic cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the sample requirement is >=10 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Across large study cohorts, this requirement will exceed what is obtainable for many individual patients/time points. For this reason, we were interested in the impact of differential peptide loading across multiplex channels on proteomic data quality. To achieve this, we tested a range of channel loading amounts (approximately the material obtainable from 5E5, 1E6, 2.5E6, 5E6, and 1E7 AML patient cells) to assess proteome coverage, quantification precision, and peptide/phosphopeptide detection in experiments utilizing isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. As expected, fewer missing values were observed in TMT channels with higher peptide loading amounts compared to lower loadings. Moreover, channels with a lower loading have greater quantitative variability than channels with higher loadings. A statistical analysis showed that decreased loading amounts result in an increase in the type I error rate. We then examined the impact of differential loading on the detection of known differences between distinct AML cell lines. Similar patterns of increased data missingness and higher quantitative variability were observed as loading was decreased resulting in fewer statistical differences; however, we found good agreement in features identified as differential, demonstrating the value of this approach.
PXD029369	34813359	Adipocyte-derived exosomes may promote breast cancer progression in type 2 diabetes. 	Adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles promote breast cancer progression in Type 2 diabetes	Adipocyte Exosomes, Breast Cancer	Obesity and metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D), are associated with metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Here, we investigated the critical cellular and molecular factors behind this link. We found that primary human adipocytes shed extracellular vesicles, specifically exosomes, that induced the expression of genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem-like cell (CSC) traits in cocultured breast cancer cell lines. Transcription of these genes was further increased in cells exposed to exosomes shed from T2D patient-derived adipocytes or insulin-resistant adipocytes and required the epigenetic reader proteins BRD2 and BRD4 in recipient cells. The thrombospondin family protein TSP5, which is associated with cancer, was more abundant in exosomes from T2D or insulin-resistant adipocytes and partially contributed to EMT in recipient cells. Bioinformatic analysis of breast cancer patient tissue showed that greater coexpression of COMP (which encodes TSP5) and BRD2 or BRD3 correlated with poorer prognosis, specifically decreased distant metastasis-free survival. Our findings reveal a mechanism of exosome-mediated cross-talk between metabolically abnormal adipocytes and breast cancer cells that may promote tumor aggressiveness in patients with T2D.
PXD028551	34815414	Capacitive interdigitated system of high osteoinductive/conductive performance for personalized acting-sensing implants. 	Capacitive electrical stimulation effects on osteoblast-released matrix microvesicles	bone, capacitive coupling, electrical stimulation, extracellular, matrix microvesicles, osteoblasts	Replacement orthopedic surgeries are among the most common surgeries worldwide, but clinically used passive implants cannot prevent failure rates and inherent revision arthroplasties. Optimized non -instrumented implants, resorting to preclinically tested bioactive coatings, improve initial osseointegration but lack long-term personalized actuation on the bone- implant interface. Novel bioelectronic devices comprising biophysical stimulators and sensing systems are thus emerging, aiming for long-term control of peri-implant bone growth through biointerface monitoring. These acting-sensing dual systems require high frequency (HF) operations able to stimulate osteoinduction/osteoconduction, including matrix maturation and mineralization. A sensing-compatible capacitive stimulator of thin interdigitated electrodes and delivering an electrical 60 kHz HF stimulation, 30 min/day, is here shown to promote osteoconduction in pre-osteoblasts and osteoinduction in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs). HF stimulation through this capacitive interdigitated system had significant effects on osteoblasts' collagen-I synthesis, matrix, and mineral deposition. A proteomic analysis of microvesicles released from electrically-stimulated osteoblasts revealed regulation of osteodifferentiation and mineralization-related proteins (e.g. Tgfb3, Ttyh3, Itih1, Aldh1a1). Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD028551. Further, under HF stimulation, hASCs exhibited higher osteogenic commitment and enhanced hydroxyapatite deposition. These promising osteoinductive/conductive capacitive stimulators will integrate novel bioelectronic implants able to monitor the bone-implant interface and deliver personalized stimulation to peri-implant tissues.
PXD029255	34817176	Chemoproteomic Profiling by Cysteine Fluoroalkylation Reveals Myrocin G as an Inhibitor of the Nonhomologous End Joining DNA Repair Pathway. 	Chemoproteomic Profiling by Cysteine Fluoroalkylation Reveals the DNA Repair Protein XRCC5 as a Functional Target of Myrocin G	Q Exactive HF-X, hypervalent iodine, myrocin, natural product, target ID	Chemoproteomic profiling of cysteines has emerged as a powerful method for screening the proteome-wide targets of cysteine-reactive fragments, drugs, and natural products. Herein, we report the development and an in-depth evaluation of a tetrafluoroalkyl benziodoxole (TFBX) as a cysteine-selective chemoproteomic probe. We show that this probe features numerous key improvements compared to the traditionally used cysteine-reactive probes, including a superior target occupancy, faster labeling kinetics, and broader proteomic coverage, thus enabling profiling of cysteines directly in live cells. In addition, the fluorine "signature" of probe 7 constitutes an additional advantage resulting in a more confident adduct-amino acid site assignment in mass-spectrometry-based identification workflows. We demonstrate the utility of our new probe for proteome-wide target profiling by identifying the cellular targets of (-)-myrocin G, an antiproliferative fungal natural product with a to-date unknown mechanism of action. We show that this natural product and a simplified analogue target the X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 5 (XRCC5), an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that primes DNA repair machinery for nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) upon DNA double-strand breaks, making them the first reported inhibitors of this biomedically highly important protein. We further demonstrate that myrocins disrupt the interaction of XRCC5 with DNA leading to sensitization of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide as well as UV-light-induced DNA damage. Altogether, our next-generation cysteine-reactive probe enables broader and deeper profiling of the cysteinome, rendering it a highly attractive tool for elucidation of targets of electrophilic small molecules.
PXD025668	34818016	Does Data-Independent Acquisition Data Contain Hidden Gems? A Case Study Related to Alzheimer's Disease. 	Alzheimer's Disease Isomerization	Alzheimer's disease, DIA mass spectrometry, amino acid isomerization, autophagy	One of the potential benefits of using data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics protocols is that information not originally targeted by the study may be present and discovered by subsequent analysis. Herein, we reanalyzed DIA data originally recorded for global proteomic analysis to look for isomerized peptides, which occur as a result of spontaneous chemical modifications to long-lived proteins. Examination of a large set of human brain samples revealed a striking relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) status and isomerization of aspartic acid in a peptide from tau. Relative to controls, a surprising increase in isomer abundance was found in both autosomal dominant and sporadic AD samples. To explore potential mechanisms that might account for these observations, quantitative analysis of proteins related to isomerization repair and autophagy was performed. Differences consistent with reduced autophagic flux in AD-related samples relative to controls were found for numerous proteins, including most notably p62, a recognized indicator of autophagic inhibition. These results suggest, but do not conclusively demonstrate, that lower autophagic flux may be strongly associated with loss of function in AD brains. This study illustrates that DIA data may contain unforeseen results of interest and may be particularly useful for pilot studies investigating new research directions. In this case, a promising target for future investigations into the therapy and prevention of AD has been identified.
PXD017130	34818552	Immuno-transcriptomic profiling of extracranial pediatric solid malignancies. 	Immuno-Transcriptomic Profiling Identifies Actionable Alterations in Pediatric Solid Malignancies	Immunology, Malignancies, Pediatric, Transcriptome	We perform an immunogenomics analysis utilizing whole-transcriptome sequencing of 657 pediatric extracranial solid cancer samples representing 14 diagnoses, and additionally utilize transcriptomes of 131 pediatric cancer cell lines and 147 normal tissue samples for comparison. We describe patterns of infiltrating immune cells, T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion, and translationally relevant immune checkpoints. We find that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and TCR counts vary widely across cancer types and within each diagnosis, and notably are significantly predictive of survival in osteosarcoma patients. We identify potential cancer-specific immunotherapeutic targets for adoptive cell therapies including cell-surface proteins, tumor germline antigens, and lineage-specific transcription factors. Using an orthogonal immunopeptidomics approach, we find several potential immunotherapeutic targets in osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma and validated PRAME as a bona fide multi-pediatric cancer target. Importantly, this work provides a critical framework for immune targeting of extracranial solid tumors using parallel immuno-transcriptomic and -peptidomic approaches.
PXD018448	34818587	Functional soil mycobiome across ecosystems. 	Structure and function of the topsoil metaproteome across global biomes: a survey of the topsoil metaproteome across global biomes	LC-MS, Soil metaproteomics, global microbiomes, survey, topsoil	Fungi support a wide range of ecosystem processes such as decomposition of organic matter and plant-soil relationships. Yet, our understanding of the factors driving the metaproteome of fungal communities is still scarce. Here, we conducted a field survey including data on fungal biomass (by phospholipid fatty acids, PLFA), community composition (by metabarcoding of the 18S rRNA gene from extracted DNA) and functional profile (by metaproteomics) to investigate soil fungi and their relation to edaphic and environmental variables across three ecosystems (forests, grasslands, and shrublands) distributed across the globe. We found that protein richness of soil fungi was significantly higher in forests than in shrublands. Among a wide suite of edaphic and environmental variables, we found that soil carbon content and plant cover shaped evenness and diversity of fungal soil proteins while protein richness correlated to mean annual temperature and pH. Functions shifted from metabolism in forests to information processing and storage in shrublands. The differences between the biomes highlight the utility of metaproteomics to investigate functional microbiomes in soil. SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the structure and the function of fungal communities and the driving factors is crucial to determine the contribution to ecosystem services of fungi and what effect future climate has. While there is considerable knowledge on the ecosystem processes provided by fungi such as decomposition of organic matter and plant-soil relationships, our understanding of the driving factors of the fungal metaproteome is scarce. Here we present the first estimates of fungal topsoil protein diversity in a wide range of soils across global biomes. We report taxonomic differences for genes delivered by amplicon sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene and differences of the functional microbiome based on metaproteomics. Both methods gave a complementary view on the fungal topsoil communities, unveiling both taxonomic and functional changes with changing environments. Such a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of fungal topsoil communities has never been performed before, to our knowledge.
PXD024628	34819065	Elp1 facilitates RAD51-mediated homologous recombination repair via translational regulation. 	Control and Ikbkap-knockout MEFs LC-MSMS	Ikbkap, MEFs	BACKGROUND: RAD51-dependent homologous recombination (HR) is one of the most important pathways for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and its regulation is crucial to maintain genome integrity. Elp1 gene encodes IKAP/ELP1, a core subunit of the Elongator complex, which has been implicated in translational regulation. However, how ELP1 contributes to genome maintenance is unclear. METHODS: To investigate the function of Elp1, Elp1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated. Metaphase chromosome spreading, immunofluorescence, and comet assays were used to access chromosome abnormalities and DSB formation. Functional roles of Elp1 in MEFs were evaluated by cell viability, colony forming capacity, and apoptosis assays. HR-dependent DNA repair was assessed by reporter assay, immunofluorescence, and western blot. Polysome profiling was used to evaluate translational efficiency. Differentially expressed proteins and signaling pathways were identified using a label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics approach. RESULTS: Here, we report that Elp1 depletion enhanced genomic instability, manifested as chromosome breakage and genotoxic stress-induced genomic DNA fragmentation upon ionizing radiation (IR) exposure. Elp1-deficient cells were hypersensitive to DNA damage and exhibited impaired cell proliferation and defective HR repair. Moreover, Elp1 depletion reduced the formation of IR-induced RAD51 foci and decreased RAD51 protein levels. Polysome profiling analysis revealed that ELP1 regulated RAD51 expression by promoting its translation in response to DNA damage. Notably, the requirement for ELP1 in DSB repair could be partially rescued in Elp1-deficient cells by reintroducing RAD51, suggesting that Elp1-mediated HR-directed repair of DSBs is RAD51-dependent. Finally, using proteome analyses, we identified several proteins involved in cancer pathways and DNA damage responses as being differentially expressed upon Elp1 depletion. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a molecular mechanism underlying Elp1-mediated regulation of HR activity and provides a novel link between translational regulation and genome stability.
PXD025411	34819072	Highly flexible metabolism of the marine euglenozoan protist Diplonema papillatum. 	Highly flexible metabolism of the marine euglenozoan protist Diplonema papillatum	Diplonema papillatum, euglenozoans, hypoxia, metabolism, mitochondrion	BACKGROUND: The phylum Euglenozoa is a group of flagellated protists comprising the diplonemids, euglenids, symbiontids, and kinetoplastids. The diplonemids are highly abundant and speciose, and recent tools have rendered the best studied representative, Diplonema papillatum, genetically tractable. However, despite the high diversity of diplonemids, their lifestyles, ecological functions, and even primary energy source are mostly unknown. RESULTS: We designed a metabolic map of D. papillatum cellular bioenergetic pathways based on the alterations of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles obtained from cells grown under different conditions. Comparative analysis in the nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor media, as well as the absence and presence of oxygen, revealed its capacity for extensive metabolic reprogramming that occurs predominantly on the proteomic rather than the transcriptomic level. D. papillatum is equipped with fundamental metabolic routes such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, respiratory complexes, beta-oxidation, and synthesis of fatty acids. Gluconeogenesis is uniquely dominant over glycolysis under all surveyed conditions, while the TCA cycle represents an eclectic combination of standard and unusual enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of conventional anaerobic enzymes reflects the ability of this protist to survive in low-oxygen environments. Furthermore, its metabolism quickly reacts to restricted carbon availability, suggesting a high metabolic flexibility of diplonemids, which is further reflected in cell morphology and motility, correlating well with their extreme ecological valence.
PXD020225	34819099	Silica-coated magnetic-nanoparticle-induced cytotoxicity is reduced in microglia by glutathione and citrate identified using integrated omics. 	Silica-cSilica-coated-magnetic-nanoparticle-induced cytotoxicity is reduced in microglia by glutathione and citrate discovered using integrated omics analysisoated-magnetic-nanoparticle-induced cytotoxicity is reduced in microglia by glutathione and citra	integrated omics, machine learning, microglia, nanotoxicity, silica-coated- magnetic nanoparticles	BACKGROUND: Nanoparticles have been utilized in brain research and therapeutics, including imaging, diagnosis, and drug delivery, owing to their versatile properties compared to bulk materials. However, exposure to nanoparticles leads to their accumulation in the brain, but drug development to counteract this nanotoxicity remains challenging. To date, concerns have risen about the potential toxicity to the brain associated with nanoparticles exposure via penetration of the brain blood barrier to address this issue. METHODS: Here the effect of silica-coated-magnetic nanoparticles containing the rhodamine B isothiocyanate dye [MNPs@SiO2(RITC)] were assessed on microglia through toxicological investigation, including biological analysis and integration of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-induced biological changes, such as morphology, generation of reactive oxygen species, intracellular accumulation of MNPs@SiO2(RITC) using transmission electron microscopy, and glucose uptake efficiency, were analyzed in BV2 murine microglial cells. Each omics data was collected via RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome analysis, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteome analysis, and gas chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolome analysis. The three omics datasets were integrated and generated as a single network using a machine learning algorithm. Nineteen compounds were screened and predicted their effects on nanotoxicity within the triple-omics network. RESULTS: Intracellular reactive oxygen species production, an inflammatory response, and morphological activation of cells were greater, but glucose uptake was lower in MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-treated BV2 microglia and primary rat microglia in a dose-dependent manner. Expression of 121 genes (from 41,214 identified genes), and levels of 45 proteins (from 5918 identified proteins) and 17 metabolites (from 47 identified metabolites) related to the above phenomena changed in MNPs@SiO2(RITC)-treated microglia. A combination of glutathione and citrate attenuated nanotoxicity induced by MNPs@SiO2(RITC) and ten other nanoparticles in vitro and in the murine brain, protecting mostly the hippocampus and thalamus. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of glutathione and citrate can be one of the candidates for nanotoxicity alleviating drug against MNPs@SiO2(RITC) induced detrimental effect, including elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species level, activation of microglia, and reduction in glucose uptake efficiency. In addition, our findings indicate that an integrated triple omics approach provides useful and sensitive toxicological assessment for nanoparticles and screening of drug for nanotoxicity.
PXD027217	34819513	Nuclear-capture of endosomes depletes nuclear G-actin to promote SRF/MRTF activation and cancer cell invasion. 	Nuclear-capture of endosomes drives depletion of nuclear G-actin to promote SRF/MRTF gene expression and cancer cell invasiveness.	EphA2, Heptocyte growth factor (HGF), Myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), Rab17, Serum-response factor (SRF), actin polymerisation, cell:cell repulsion, invasiveness, nuclear G-actin, nuclear import, pancreatic adenocarcinoma	Signals are relayed from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) at the cell surface to effector systems in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and coordination of this process is important for the execution of migratory phenotypes, such as cell scattering and invasion. The endosomal system influences how RTK signalling is coded, but the ways in which it transmits these signals to the nucleus to influence gene expression are not yet clear. Here we show that hepatocyte growth factor, an activator of MET (an RTK), promotes Rab17- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis of EphA2, another RTK, followed by centripetal transport of EphA2-positive endosomes. EphA2 then mediates physical capture of endosomes on the outer surface of the nucleus; a process involving interaction between the nuclear import machinery and a nuclear localisation sequence in EphA2's cytodomain. Nuclear capture of EphA2 promotes RhoG-dependent phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein, cofilin to oppose nuclear import of G-actin. The resulting depletion of nuclear G-actin drives transcription of Myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)/serum-response factor (SRF)-target genes to implement cell scattering and the invasive behaviour of cancer cells.
PXD027541	34820370	MicroRNA-222 Transferred From Semen Extracellular Vesicles Inhibits Sperm Apoptosis by Targeting BCL2L11. 	Pig,extracellular vesicles,LC-MS	LC-MS, Pig, extracellular vesicles, seminal plasma	Seminal plasma contains a large number of extracellular vesicles (EVs). However, the roles of these EVs and their interactions with sperm are not clear. To identify the important molecules affecting sperm motility in EVs, we analyzed RNA from seminal plasma EVs of boars with different sperm motility using whole-transcriptome sequencing and proteomic analysis. In total, 7 miRNAs, 67 lncRNAs, 126 mRNAs and 76 proteins were differentially expressed between the two groups. We observed that EV-miR-222 can obviously improve sperm motility. In addition, the results suggested that miR-222 was transferred into sperm by the EVs and that miR-222 affected sperm apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of EGFR, BCL2L11, BAX, CYCs, CASP9 and CASP3. The results of electron microscopy also showed that overexpression of miR-222 in EVs could reduce sperm apoptosis. The study of the whole transcriptomes and proteomes of EVs in boar semen revealed some miRNAs may play an important role in these EVs interactions with Duroc sperm, and the findings suggest that the release of miR-222 by semen EVs is an important mechanism by which sperm viability is maintained and sperm apoptosis is reduced. Our studies provide a new insight of miR-222 in EVs regulation for sperm motility and sperm apoptosis.
PXD027997	34822548	Systemic Effects of Hemorrhagic Snake Venom Metalloproteinases: Untargeted Peptidomics to Explore the Pathodegradome of Plasma Proteins. 	Systemic effects of hemorrhagic snake venom metalloproteinases: untargeted peptidomics to explore the pathodegradome of plasma proteins	Bothrops, Hemorrhagic factor 3 (HF3), degradome, human plasma, snake venom	Hemorrhage induced by snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) is a complex phenomenon that involves capillary disruption and blood extravasation. HF3 (hemorrhagic factor 3) is an extremely hemorrhagic SVMP of Bothrops jararaca venom. Studies using proteomic approaches revealed targets of HF3 among intracellular and extracellular proteins. However, the role of the cleavage of plasma proteins in the context of the hemorrhage remains not fully understood. The main goal of this study was to analyze the degradome of HF3 in human plasma. For this purpose, approaches for the depletion of the most abundant proteins, and for the enrichment of low abundant proteins of human plasma, were used to minimize the dynamic range of protein concentration, in order to assess the proteolytic activity of HF3 on a wide spectrum of proteins, and to detect the degradation products using mass spectrometry-based untargeted peptidomics. The results revealed the hydrolysis products generated by HF3 and allowed the identification of cleavage sites. A total of 61 plasma proteins were identified as cleaved by HF3. Some of these proteins corroborate previous studies, and others are new HF3 targets, including proteins of the coagulation cascade, of the complement system, proteins acting on the modulation of inflammation, and plasma proteinase inhibitors. Overall, the data indicate that HF3 escapes inhibition and sculpts the plasma proteome by degrading key proteins and generating peptides that may act synergistically in the hemorrhagic process.
PXD019850	34822614	Reduced Toxicity of Centruroides vittatus (Say, 1821) May Result from Lowered Sodium beta Toxin Gene Expression and Toxin Protein Production. 	Scorpion (Centruroides vittatus) venom gland	Centruroides vittatus, scorpion, venom	Body tissue and venom glands from an eastern population of the scorpion Centruroides vittatus (Say, 1821) were homogenized and molecular constituents removed to characterize putative sodium beta toxin gene diversity, RT-qPCR, transcriptomic, and proteomic variation. We cloned sodium beta toxins from genomic DNA, conducted RT-qPCR experiments with seven sodium beta toxin variants, performed venom gland tissue RNA-seq, and isolated venom proteins for mass spectrophotometry. We identified >70 putative novel sodium beta toxin genes, 111 toxin gene transcripts, 24 different toxin proteins, and quantified sodium beta toxin gene expression variation among individuals and between sexes. Our analyses contribute to the growing evidence that venom toxicity among scorpion taxa and their populations may be associated with toxin gene diversity, specific toxin transcripts variation, and subsequent protein production. Here, slight transcript variation among toxin gene variants may contribute to the major toxin protein variation in individual scorpion venom composition.
PXD025482	34823380	Methodology to Quantify Collagen Subtypes and Crosslinks: Application in Minipig Cartilages. 	Proteomics of Yucatan minipig cartilages	Cartilage, Yucatan minipig, collagen, collagen subtype, fibrocartilage, hyaline cartilage	INTRODUCTION: This study develops assays to quantify collagen subtypes and crosslinks with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and characterizes the cartilages in the Yucatan minipig. METHODS: For collagen subtyping, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was performed on tissues digested in trypsin. For collagen crosslinks, LC-MS analysis was performed on hydrolysates. Samples were also examined histologically and with bottom-up proteomics. Ten cartilages (femoral condyle, femoral head, facet joint, floating rib, true rib, auricular cartilage, annulus fibrosus, 2 meniscus locations, and temporomandibular joint disc) were analyzed. RESULTS: The collagen subtyping assay quantified collagen types I and II. The collagen crosslinks assay quantified mature and immature crosslinks. Collagen subtyping revealed that collagen type I predominates in fibrocartilages and collagen type II in hyaline cartilages, as expected. Elastic cartilage and fibrocartilages had more mature collagen crosslink profiles than hyaline cartilages. Bottom-up proteomics revealed a spectrum of ratios between collagen types I and II, and quantified 42 proteins, including 24 collagen alpha-chains and 12 minor collagen types. DISCUSSION: The novel assays developed in this work are sensitive, inexpensive, and use a low operator time relative to other collagen analysis methods. Unlike the current collagen assays, these assays quantify collagen subtypes and crosslinks without an antibody-based approach or lengthy chromatography. They apply to any collagenous tissue, with broad applications in tissue characterization and tissue engineering. For example, a novel finding of this work was the presence of a large quantity of collagen type III in the white-white knee meniscus and a spectrum of hyaline and fibrous cartilages.
PXD023219	34824277	NUDT2 initiates viral RNA degradation by removal of 5'-phosphates. 	NUDT2 Knockout full proteome mouse	LC-MS, Nudix hydolases, bone-marrow, full proteome	While viral replication processes are largely understood, comparably little is known on cellular mechanisms degrading viral RNA. Some viral RNAs bear a 5'-triphosphate (PPP-) group that impairs degradation by the canonical 5'-3' degradation pathway. Here we show that the Nudix hydrolase 2 (NUDT2) trims viral PPP-RNA into monophosphorylated (P)-RNA, which serves as a substrate for the 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1. NUDT2 removes 5'-phosphates from PPP-RNA in an RNA sequence- and overhang-independent manner and its ablation in cells increases growth of PPP-RNA viruses, suggesting an involvement in antiviral immunity. NUDT2 is highly homologous to bacterial RNA pyrophosphatase H (RppH), a protein involved in the metabolism of bacterial mRNA, which is 5'-tri- or diphosphorylated. Our results show a conserved function between bacterial RppH and mammalian NUDT2, indicating that the function may have adapted from a protein responsible for RNA turnover in bacteria into a protein involved in the immune defense in mammals.
PXD029274	34825148	Proteostasis regulated by testis-specific ribosomal protein RPL39L maintains mouse spermatogenesis. 	Studying the role of RPL39L in mouse spermatogenesis	RPL39L, proteostasis, spermatogenesis	Maintaining proteostasis is important for animal development. How proteostasis influences spermatogenesis that generates male gametes, spermatozoa, is not clear. We show that testis-specific paralog of ribosomal large subunit protein RPL39, RPL39L, is required for mouse spermatogenesis. Deletion of Rpl39l in mouse caused reduced proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells, malformed sperm mitochondria and flagella, leading to sub-fertility in males. Biochemical analyses revealed that lack of RPL39L deteriorated protein synthesis and protein quality control in spermatogenic cells, partly due to reduced biogenesis of ribosomal subunits and ribosome homeostasis. RPL39/RPL39L is likely assembled into ribosomes via H/ACA domain containing NOP10 complex early in ribosome biogenesis pathway. Furthermore, Rpl39l null mice exhibited compromised regenerative spermatogenesis after chemical insult and early degenerative spermatogenesis in aging mice. These data demonstrate that maintaining proteostasis is important for spermatogenesis, of which ribosome homeostasis maintained by ribosomal proteins coordinates translation machinery to the regulation of cellular growth.
PXD028685	34827627	Comprehensive Atlas of the Myelin Basic Protein Interaction Landscape. 	Comprehensive atlas of the myelin basic protein interaction landscape	Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Myelin basic protein, formaldehyde-induced cross-linking, protein-protein interaction	Intrinsically disordered myelin basic protein (MBP) is one of the key autoantigens in autoimmune neurodegeneration and multiple sclerosis particularly. MBP is highly positively charged and lacks distinct structure in solution and therefore its intracellular partners are still mostly enigmatic. Here we used combination of formaldehyde-induced cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to elucidate the interaction network of MBP in mammalian cells and provide the list of potential MBP interacting proteins. Our data suggest that the largest group of MBP-interacting proteins belongs to cellular proteins involved in the protein translation machinery, as well as in the spatial and temporal regulation of translation. MBP interacts with core ribosomal proteins, RNA helicase Ddx28 and RNA-binding proteins STAU1, TDP-43, ADAR-1 and hnRNP A0, which are involved in various stages of RNA biogenesis and processing, including specific maintaining MBP-coding mRNA. Among MBP partners we identified CTNND1, which has previously been shown to be necessary for myelinating Schwann cells for cell-cell interactions and the formation of a normal myelin sheath. MBP binds proteins MAGEB2/D2 associated with neurotrophin receptor p75NTR, involved in pathways that promote neuronal survival and neuronal death. Finally, we observed that MBP interacts with RNF40-a component of heterotetrameric Rnf40/Rnf20 E3 ligase complex, recruited by Egr2, which is the central transcriptional regulator of peripheral myelination. Concluding, our data suggest that MBP may be more actively involved in myelination not only as a main building block but also as a self-regulating element.
PXD028657	34829264	Extracellular Vesicles from Fusarium graminearum Contain Protein Effectors Expressed during Infection of Corn. 	Proteome of extracellular vesicles from the filamentous fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum	Fungi, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium head blight, extracellular vesicles	Fusarium&nbsp;graminearum (Fgr) is a devastating filamentous fungal pathogen that causes diseases in cereals, while producing mycotoxins that are toxic for humans and animals, and render grains unusable. Low efficiency in managing Fgr poses a constant need for identifying novel control mechanisms. Evidence that fungal extracellular vesicles (EVs) from pathogenic yeast have a role in human disease led us to question whether this is also true for fungal plant pathogens. We separated EVs from Fgr and performed a proteomic analysis to determine if EVs carry proteins with potential roles in pathogenesis. We revealed that protein effectors, which are crucial for fungal virulence, were detected in EV preparations and some of them did not contain predicted secretion signals. Furthermore, a transcriptomic analysis of corn (Zea&nbsp;mays) plants infected by Fgr revealed that the genes of some of the effectors were highly expressed in vivo, suggesting that the Fgr EVs are a mechanism for the unconventional secretion of effectors and virulence factors. Our results expand the knowledge on fungal EVs in plant pathogenesis and cross-kingdom communication, and may contribute to the discovery of new antifungals.
PXD029545	34829991	Phosphoproteomic Comparison of Four Eimeria tenella Life Cycle Stages. 	Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of Eimeria tenella six stages (unsporulated oocysts (USO), partial sporulated 7 h oocysts (SO7h), sporulated oocysts (SO), sporozoites (S), second generation merozoite (M2) and gametocyte (G))	Eimeria tenella	Protein phosphorylation is an important post-translational modification (PTM) involved in diverse cellular functions. It is the most prevalent PTM in both Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum, but its status in Eimeria tenella has not been reported. Herein, we performed a comprehensive, quantitative phosphoproteomic profile analysis of four stages of the E. tenella life cycle: unsporulated oocysts (USO), partially sporulated (7 h) oocysts (SO7h), sporulated oocysts (SO), and sporozoites (S). A total of 15,247 phosphorylation sites on 9514 phosphopeptides corresponding to 2897 phosphoproteins were identified across the four stages. In addition, 456, 479, and 198 differentially expressed phosphoproteins (DEPPs) were identified in the comparisons SO7h vs. USO, SO vs. SO7h, and S vs. SO, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of DEPPs suggested that they were involved in diverse functions. For SO7h vs. USO, DEPPs were mainly involved in cell division, actin cytoskeleton organization, positive regulation of transport, and pyruvate metabolism. For SO vs. SO7h, they were related to the peptide metabolic process, translation, and RNA transport. DEPPs in the S vs. SO comparison were associated with the tricarboxylic acid metabolic process, positive regulation of ATPase activity, and calcium ion binding. Time course sequencing data analysis (TCseq) identified six clusters with similar expression change characteristics related to carbohydrate metabolism, cytoskeleton organization, and calcium ion transport, demonstrating different regulatory profiles across the life cycle of E. tenella. The results revealed significant changes in the abundance of phosphoproteins during E. tenella development. The findings shed light on the key roles of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the E. tenella life cycle.
PXD029086	34830330	Proteomic Analysis of Marinesco-Sjogren Syndrome Fibroblasts Indicates Pro-Survival Metabolic Adaptation to SIL1 Loss. 	Proteomic analysis of Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome fibroblasts indicates pro-survival metabolic adaptation to SIL1 loss	BiP, Protein folding, autophagosome, fibroblast, neurodegenerative disease, pathway analysis, unfolded protein response	Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (MSS) is a rare multisystem pediatric disorder, caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the endoplasmic reticulum cochaperone SIL1. SIL1 acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for BiP, which plays a central role in secretory protein folding. SIL1 mutant cells have reduced BiP-assisted protein folding, cannot fulfil their protein needs, and experience chronic activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Maladaptive UPR may explain the cerebellar and skeletal muscle degeneration responsible for the ataxia and muscle weakness typical of MSS. However, the cause of other more variable, clinical manifestations, such as mild to severe mental retardation, hypogonadism, short stature, and skeletal deformities, is less clear. To gain insights into the pathogenic mechanisms and/or adaptive responses to SIL1 loss, we carried out cell biological and proteomic investigations in skin fibroblasts derived from a young patient carrying the SIL1 R111X mutation. Despite fibroblasts not being overtly affected in MSS, we found morphological and biochemical changes indicative of UPR activation and altered cell metabolism. All the cell machineries involved in RNA splicing and translation were strongly downregulated, while protein degradation via lysosome-based structures was boosted, consistent with an attempt of the cell to reduce the workload of the endoplasmic reticulum and dispose of misfolded proteins. Cell metabolism was extensively affected as we observed a reduction in lipid synthesis, an increase in beta oxidation, and an enhancement of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with upregulation of eight of its enzymes. Finally, the catabolic pathways of various amino acids, including valine, leucine, isoleucine, tryptophan, lysine, aspartate, and phenylalanine, were enhanced, while the biosynthetic pathways of arginine, serine, glycine, and cysteine were reduced. These results indicate that, in addition to UPR activation and increased protein degradation, MSS fibroblasts have profound metabolic alterations, which may help them cope with the absence of SIL1.
PXD029090	34830459	Membrane Vesicles of Pectobacterium as an Effective Protein Secretion System. 	Membrane vesicles of Pectobacterium as an underappreciated protein secretion system	Pectobacterium, bacterial membrane vesicles, bacterial virulence, plant pathogens, proteomic analysis	Bacteria of genus Pectobacterium are Gram-negative rods of the family Pectobacteriaceae. They are the causative agent of soft rot diseases of crops and ornamental plants. However, their virulence mechanisms are not yet fully elucidated. Membrane vesicles (MVs) are universally released by bacteria and are believed to play an important role in the pathogenicity and survival of bacteria in the environment. Our study investigates the role of MVs in the virulence of Pectobacterium. The results indicate that the morphology and MVs production depend on growth medium composition. In polygalacturonic acid (PGA) supplemented media, Pectobacterium produces large MVs (100-300 nm) and small vesicles below 100 nm. Proteomic analyses revealed the presence of pectate degrading enzymes in the MVs. The pectate plate test and enzymatic assay proved that those enzymes are active and able to degrade pectates. What is more, the pathogenicity test indicated that the MVs derived from Pectobacterium were able to induce maceration of Zantedeschia sp. leaves. We also show that the MVs of beta-lactamase producing strains were able to suppress ampicillin activity and permit the growth of susceptible bacteria. Those findings indicate that the MVs of Pectobacterium play an important role in host-pathogen interactions and niche competition with other bacteria. Our research also sheds some light on the mechanism of MVs production. We demonstrate that the MVs production in Pectobacterium strains, which overexpress a green fluorescence protein (GFP), is higher than in wild-type strains. Moreover, proteomic analysis revealed that the GFP was present in the MVs. Therefore, it is possible that protein sequestration into MVs might not be strictly limited to periplasmic proteins. Our research highlights the importance of MVs production as a mechanism of cargo delivery in Pectobacterium and an effective secretion system.
PXD028537	34830790	PGRMC1 Promotes Progestin-Dependent Proliferation of Breast Cancer Cells by Binding Prohibitins Resulting in Activation of ERalpha Signaling. 	PGRMC1 promotes progestin-dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells by binding prohibitins resulting in activation of ERalpha signaling	PGRMC1, PHB1, PHB2, breast cancer, estrogen receptor, hormone therapy, progesterone, progestins	In previous studies, we reported that progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) is implicated in progestin signaling and possibly associated with increased breast cancer risk upon combined hormone replacement therapy. To gain mechanistic insight, we searched for potential PGRMC1 interaction partners upon progestin treatment by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. The interactions with the identified partners were further characterized with respect to PGRMC1 phosphorylation status and with emphasis on the crosstalk between PGRMC1 and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). We report that PGRMC1 overexpression resulted in increased proliferation of hormone receptor positive breast cancer cell lines upon treatment with a subgroup of progestins including norethisterone and dydrogesterone that promote PGRMC1-phosphorylation on S181. The ERalpha modulators prohibitin-1 (PHB1) and prohibitin-2 (PHB2) interact with PGRMC1 in dependency on S181-phosphorylation upon treatment with the same progestins. Moreover, increased interaction between PGRMC1 and PHBs correlated with decreased binding of PHBs to ERalpha and subsequent ERalpha activation. Inhibition of either PGRMC1 or ERalpha abolished this effect. In summary, we provide strong evidence that activated PGRMC1 associates with PHBs, competitively removing them from ERalpha, which then can develop its transcriptional activities on target genes. This study emphasizes the role of PGRMC1 in a key breast cancer signaling pathway which may provide a new avenue to target hormone-dependent breast cancer.
PXD028514	34831084	A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 2 Promotes Protection against Myocardial Infarction. 	AKAP2 interactome in the rat heart	AKAP2, immunoprecipitation, protein-protein interactions	Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of maladaptive cardiac remodeling and heart failure. In the damaged heart, loss of function is mainly due to cardiomyocyte death and remodeling of the cardiac tissue. The current study shows that A-kinase anchoring protein 2 (AKAP2) orchestrates cellular processes favoring cardioprotection in infarcted hearts. Induction of AKAP2 knockout (KO) in cardiomyocytes of adult mice increases infarct size and exacerbates cardiac dysfunction after MI, as visualized by increased left ventricular dilation and reduced fractional shortening and ejection fraction. In cardiomyocytes, AKAP2 forms a signaling complex with PKA and the steroid receptor co-activator 3 (Src3). Upon activation of cAMP signaling, the AKAP2/PKA/Src3 complex favors PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). This results in the upregulation of ER-dependent genes involved in protection against apoptosis and angiogenesis, including Bcl2 and the vascular endothelial growth factor a (VEGFa). In line with these findings, cardiomyocyte-specific AKAP2 KO reduces Bcl2 and VEGFa expression, increases myocardial apoptosis and impairs the formation of new blood vessels in infarcted hearts. Collectively, our findings suggest that AKAP2 organizes a transcriptional complex that mediates pro-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic responses that protect infarcted hearts.
PXD028359	34831095	Hypoxic Incubation Conditions for Optimized Manufacture of Tenocyte-Based Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients of Homologous Standardized Transplant Products in Tendon Regenerative Medicine. 	Hypoxic Incubation Conditions for Optimized Manufacture of Tenocyte-Based Active Substances of Homologous Standardized Transplant Products in Tendon Regenerative Medicine	cell manufacture, human progenitor tenocytes, hypoxia, regenerative medicine, standardized transplants, tendon affections	Human fetal progenitor tenocytes (hFPT) produced in defined cell bank systems have recently been characterized and qualified as potential therapeutic cell sources in tendon regenerative medicine. In view of further developing the manufacture processes of such cell-based active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), the effects of hypoxic in vitro culture expansion on key cellular characteristics or process parameters were evaluated. To this end, multiple aspects were comparatively assessed in normoxic incubation (i.e., 5% CO2 and 21% O2, standard conditions) or in hypoxic incubation (i.e., 5% CO2 and 2% O2, optimized conditions). Experimentally investigated parameters and endpoints included cellular proliferation, cellular morphology and size distribution, cell surface marker panels, cell susceptibility toward adipogenic and osteogenic induction, while relative protein expression levels were analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. The results outlined conserved critical cellular characteristics (i.e., cell surface marker panels, cellular phenotype under chemical induction) and modified key cellular parameters (i.e., cell size distribution, endpoint cell yields, matrix protein contents) potentially procuring tangible benefits for next-generation cell manufacturing workflows. Specific proteomic analyses further shed some light on the cellular effects of hypoxia, potentially orienting further hFPT processing for cell-based, cell-free API manufacture. Overall, this study indicated that hypoxic incubation impacts specific hFPT key properties while preserving critical quality attributes (i.e., as compared to normoxic incubation), enabling efficient manufacture of tenocyte-based APIs for homologous standardized transplant products.
PXD028902	34831150	Temporal and Site-Specific ADP-Ribosylation Dynamics upon Different Genotoxic Stresses. 	Temporal and site-specific ADP-ribosylation dynamics upon different genotoxic stresses	ADP-ribosylation, Af1521, DNA damage, PARP, Post-translational modification, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS	The DNA damage response revolves around transmission of information via post-translational modifications, including reversible protein ADP-ribosylation. Here, we applied a mass-spectrometry-based Af1521 enrichment technology for the identification and quantification of ADP-ribosylation sites as a function of various DNA damage stimuli and time. In total, we detected 1681 ADP-ribosylation sites residing on 716 proteins in U2OS cells and determined their temporal dynamics after exposure to the genotoxins H2O2 and MMS. Intriguingly, we observed a widespread but low-abundance serine ADP-ribosylation response at the earliest time point, with later time points centered on increased modification of the same sites. This suggests that early serine ADP-ribosylation events may serve as a platform for an integrated signal response. While treatment with H2O2 and MMS induced homogenous ADP-ribosylation responses, we observed temporal differences in the ADP-ribosylation site abundances. Exposure to MMS-induced alkylating stress induced the strongest ADP-ribosylome response after 30 min, prominently modifying proteins involved in RNA processing, whereas in response to H2O2-induced oxidative stress ADP-ribosylation peaked after 60 min, mainly modifying proteins involved in DNA damage pathways. Collectively, the dynamic ADP-ribosylome presented here provides a valuable insight into the temporal cellular regulation of ADP-ribosylation in response to DNA damage.
PXD029141	34833084	AC016745.3 Regulates the Transcription of AR Target Genes by Antagonizing NONO. 	AC016745.3 RNA pulldown mass spectrometry data	Prostate, Protein Mass Spectrometry	The androgen receptor (AR) and its related signaling pathways play an important role in the development of prostate cancer (PCa). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the regulation of tumorigenesis and development, but their specific mechanism of action remains unclear. This study examines the function and mechanisms of action of lncRNA AC016745.3 in the development of PCa. It shows that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) results in the AR-dependent suppression of AC016745.3 expression in the LNCaP androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line. In addition, overexpression of AC016745.3 inhibits the proliferation and migration of PCa cells, and suppresses the expression of AR target genes. This research also demonstrates that the protein NONO interacts with AR and functions as an AR co-activator, promoting AR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-PCR experiments, the study demonstrates that both NONO and AR can bind AC016745.3. Moreover, cell phenotypic experiments reveal that NONO can promote cellular proliferation and migration, and that AC016745.3 can partially antagonize the pro-oncogenic functions of NONO in PCa cells. In summary, the results indicate that AC016745.3 can bind NONO, suppressing its ability to promote AR-dependent transcriptional activity. Furthermore, DHT-dependent suppression of AC016745.3 expression can enhance NONO's promotion effect on AR.
PXD022613	34834411	Characterization of Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases as a Prognostic Tool. 	Characterization of biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases as a prognostic tool	Biomarkers, Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis, Hepatic Surgery, Molecular Signature., Prognosis	BACKGROUND: Unfortunately, the majority of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) experience disease recurrence following hepatic surgery. The key challenge is therefore optimal patient selection, which currently relies on anatomical and clinical parameters. Exploring a potential molecular signature may be predictive for seeing a clinical benefit from CRCLM resection. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent CRCLM resection at our medical center between 2006 and 2016 were divided into cohorts of "good prognosis" (GP) or "poor prognosis" (PP) based on the time interval between their resection and disease recurrence. Proteomic analysis was performed on the surgical specimen and correlation analysis was carried out with demographics and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis revealed 99 differentially expressed proteins of which a third were associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Multivariate analysis yielded a statistically differential proteomic pattern between the cohort regardless of perioperative treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a different proteomic landscape in the cohort of patients who had a clinical benefit from CRCLM resection which appears to be correlated with ECM pathways. Further prospective studies are needed to define the role of ECM pathways in prognostics and patient selection for surgical procedures for CRCLM.
PXD028950	34835975	Impact of Fetal Growth Restriction on the Neonatal Microglial Proteome in the Rat. 	Impact of fetal growth restriction on neonatal microglia proteome in rat.	IUGR, brain development, inflammation, microglia	Microglial activation is a key modulator of brain vulnerability in response to intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). However, the consequences of IUGR on microglial development and the microglial proteome are still unknown. We used a model of IUGR induced by a gestational low-protein diet (LPD) in rats. Microglia, isolated from control and growth-restricted animals at P1 and P4, showed significant changes in the proteome between the two groups. The expression of protein sets associated with fetal growth, inflammation, and the immune response were significantly enriched in LPD microglia at P1 and P4. Interestingly, upregulation of protein sets associated with the oxidative stress response and reactive oxygen species production was observed at P4 but not P1. During development, inflammation-associated proteins were upregulated between P1 and P4 in both control and LPD microglia. By contrast, proteins associated with DNA repair and senescence pathways were upregulated in only LPD microglia. Similarly, protein sets involved in protein retrograde transport were significantly downregulated in only LPD microglia. Overall, these data demonstrate significant and multiple effects of LPD-induced IUGR on the developmental program of microglial cells, leading to an abnormal proteome within the first postnatal days.
PXD029091	34836941	A genetically-encoded crosslinker screen identifies SERBP1 as a PKCepsilon substrate influencing translation and cell division. 	A genetically-encoded crosslinker screen identifies SERBP1 as a PKCï¥ substrate influencing translation and cell division		The PKCepsilon-regulated genome protective pathway provides transformed cells a failsafe to successfully complete mitosis. Despite the necessary role for Aurora B in this programme, it is unclear whether its requirement is sufficient or if other PKCepsilon cell cycle targets are involved. To address this, we developed a trapping strategy using UV-photocrosslinkable amino acids encoded in the PKCepsilon kinase domain. The validation of the mRNA binding protein SERBP1 as a PKCepsilon substrate revealed a series of mitotic events controlled by the catalytic form of PKCepsilon. PKCepsilon represses protein translation, altering SERBP1 binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit and promoting the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules containing SERBP1, termed M-bodies. Independent of Aurora B, SERBP1 is shown to be necessary for chromosome segregation and successful cell division, correlating with M-body formation. This requirement for SERBP1 demonstrates that Aurora B acts in concert with translational regulation in the PKCepsilon-controlled pathway exerting genome protection.
PXD022187	34836971	BAF complexes drive proliferation and block myogenic differentiation in fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma. 	BioID HEK293T PAX3-FOXO1 proximity labelling	BioID, BirA, PAX3-FOXO1, Rhabdomyosarcoma	Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a pediatric malignancy of skeletal muscle lineage. The aggressive alveolar subtype is characterized by t(2;13) or t(1;13) translocations encoding for PAX3- or PAX7-FOXO1 chimeric transcription factors, respectively, and are referred to as fusion positive RMS (FP-RMS). The fusion gene alters the myogenic program and maintains the proliferative state while blocking terminal differentiation. Here, we investigated the contributions of chromatin regulatory complexes to FP-RMS tumor maintenance. We define the mSWI/SNF functional repertoire in FP-RMS. We find that SMARCA4 (encoding BRG1) is overexpressed in this malignancy compared to skeletal muscle and is essential for cell proliferation. Proteomic studies suggest proximity between PAX3-FOXO1 and BAF complexes, which is further supported by genome-wide binding profiles revealing enhancer colocalization of BAF with core regulatory transcription factors. Further, mSWI/SNF complexes localize to sites of de novo histone acetylation. Phenotypically, interference with mSWI/SNF complex function induces transcriptional activation of the skeletal muscle differentiation program associated with MYCN enhancer invasion at myogenic target genes, which is recapitulated by BRG1 targeting compounds. We conclude that inhibition of BRG1 overcomes the differentiation blockade of FP-RMS cells and may provide a therapeutic strategy for this lethal childhood tumor.
PXD024704	34838074	Integrated DIA proteomics and lipidomics analysis on non-small cell lung cancer patients with TCM syndromes. 	Integrated DIA proteomics and lipidomics analysis on non-small cell lung cancer patients with TCM syndromes	Lipidomics, Non-small cell lung cancer, Syndrome Differentiation, Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes	BACKGROUND: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of mortality from malignant tumors, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of lung cancer cases, and individualized diagnosis and treatment is an effective trend. The individual characteristics of different traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes of NSCLC patients may be revealed by highly specific molecular profiles. METHODS: In this study, 10 NSCLC patients with Qi deficiency and Yin deficiency (QDYD) syndrome and 10 patients with Qi deficiency of lung-spleen (QDLS) syndrome in TNM stage III-IV as well as 10 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Aiming at the varied syndromes of NSCLC patients with "Yin deficiency" as the main difference, a proteomics research based on data-independent acquisition (DIA) was developed. Of the dysregulated proteins in NSCLC patients, lipid metabolism was significantly enriched. Thereafter, nontargeted lipidomics research based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was performed in 16 patients, with 8 individuals randomly selected from each syndrome group. Furthermore, the considerably different characteristics between the syndromes and pathological mechanisms of NSCLC were screened by statistical and biological integrations of proteomics and lipidomics and the differential metabolic pathways of the two similar syndromes were further explored. Besides, lipids biomarkers were verified by a clinically used anticancer Chinese medicine, and the level of key differential proteins in the two syndromes was also validated using ELISA. RESULTS: The results showed that glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, glycolipid metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis were altered in NSCLC patients and that glycerophospholipid metabolism was significantly changed between the two syndromes in lipidomics analysis. Among the proteins and lipids, ALDOC and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPCs) were revealed to have a strong relationship by statistical and biological integration analysis, and could effectively distinguish QDLS and QDYD syndromes. Notably, the patients with different syndromes had the most typical metabolic patterns in glycerophospholipid metabolism and glycolysis, reflecting the differences in the syndromes dominated by "Yin deficiency". CONCLUSIONS: ALDOC and LPCs could be employed for the differentiation of NSCLC patients with QDLS and QDYD syndromes, and "Yin deficiency" might be associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism and glycolysis pathway. The results provided a theoretical basis for "Syndrome differentiation" in TCM diagnosis. Moreover, the developed integrated strategy could also provide a reference for individualized diagnosis and treatment of other diseases.
PXD018674	34838332	A novel Cereblon E3 ligase modulator with antitumor activity in gastrointestinal cancer. 	PROTAC-triggered degradation of MYC	LC-MS3, MYC degradation	Targeted protein degradation offers new opportunities to inactivate cancer drivers and has successfully entered the clinic. Ways to induce selective protein degradation include proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology and immunomodulatory (IMiDs) / next-generation Cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase modulating drugs (CELMoDs). Here, we aimed to develop a MYC PROTAC based on the MYC-MAX dimerization inhibitor 10058-F4 derivative 28RH and Thalidomide, called MDEG-541. We show that a subgroup of gastrointestinal cancer cell lines and primary patient-derived organoids are MDEG-541 sensitive. Although MYC expression was regulated in a CRBN-, proteasome- and ubiquitin-dependent manner, we provide evidence that MDEG-541 induced the degradation of CRBN neosubstrates, including G1 to S phase transition 1/2 (GSPT1/2) and the Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). In sum, we have established a CRBN-dependent degrader of relevant cancer targets with activity in gastrointestinal cancers.
PXD024268	34838815	Mitochondriomics reveals the underlying neuroprotective mechanism of TrkB receptor agonist R13 in the 5xFAD mice. 	Mass spectrum data for the manuscript "Mitochondriomics reveals the underlying neuoprotective mechanism of TrkB receptor agonist R13 in the 5xFAD mice"	mouse lc-ms	Decreased energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis defects are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In present study, mitochondriomics analysis revealed significant effects of R13, a prodrug of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, on mitochondrial protein expression profile, including the proteins related to the biological processes: fatty acid beta-oxidation, fatty acid metabolic process, mitochondrial electron transport, and mitochondrial respiratory chain. Cluster analysis demonstrated that R13 promoted mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The functional analysis showed that R13 increased ATP levels and enhanced OXPHOS including complex I, II, III and IV. R13 treatment increased mitochondrial biogenesis by regulating the levels of p-AMPKalpha, p-CREB, PGC-1alpha, NRF1 and TFAM as a consequence of activation of TrkB receptor in the 5 x FAD mice. Finally, R13 significantly reduced the levels of tau phosphorylation and Abeta plaque. Our data suggest that R13 may be used for treating AD via enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism.
PXD029569	34839037	Loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta plasma biochemistry and proteome profile modulation during recovery. 	Loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) TMT-based plasma proteomics	Caretta caretta, LC-MS, Loggerhead sea turtle, TMT, plasma proteomics	The aim of the study was to monitor and analyse injured and diseased loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) plasma proteome profiles and biochemistry parameters during their recovery period in rescue centre within different age and recovery period groups, and determine the potential biomarkers that can be used in diagnostics. The plasma biochemical parameters of total protein and glucose content, accompanied by aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and N-acetyl-cystein-activated creatinine kinase (CK-NAC) are highlighted as valuable and potential biomarkers of turtle's health status and condition. Using high throughput tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomic approach we identified 913 plasma proteins, 12 of which shown to be modulated in loggerheads age groups, and identified as a part of (i) platelet degranulation, (ii) neutrophil degranulation, and (iii) innate immune system pathways. The neurofascin (NFASC) is shown to be differentially abundant among all the age groups, and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 2-like (ORM2) and alpha-1-antitrypsin-like (SERPINA1) proteins were recognized as members of all three above mentioned REACTOME pathways. Furthermore, 29 of plasma proteins were significantly differentially abundant in loggerheads age and recovery period groups. Out of 15 recognized pathways, those proteins were mostly included in three specific REACTOME pathways: (i) post-translational phosphorylation, (ii) regulation of Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF) transport and uptake by Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Proteins (IGFBPs), and (iii) platelet degranulation. The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was the only protein which showed statistically significant up-regulation patterns in all loggerhead age groups before release from the rescue centre, and the complement component 3 (C3) protein was the only protein modulated in all recovery period groups. Furthermore, C3 protein takes part in 9; and followed up with apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) in 7; complement component 4 (C4), complement component 5 (C5) and kininogen-1 (KNG1) in 6 REACTOME pathways. Thereby, those proteins are highlighted and recommended as potential biomarkers of turtle's health status. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD029569. Finally, based on our results, we believe that comprehensive omics approach and routine plasma biochemical analysis, accompanied by proteins of acute phase, acid-base status and immune-response indicator analysis may significantly and reliably improve assessment of captive loggerheads rehabilitation and medication. SIGNIFICANCE: Monitoring and comparison of loggerhead sea turtles (C. caretta) blood plasma biochemistry parameters and plasma proteome profiles in relation to the age, and recovery period pointed out significantly differentially abundant proteins, along with certain biochemical parameter contents as potential biomarkers of turtle's fitness, health status and physiology.
PXD027863	34841231	Targeting myeloid-derived suppressor cells to attenuate vasculogenic mimicry and synergistically enhance the anti-tumor effect of PD-1 inhibitor. 	Label free quantitativeproteomics of MDSCs	MDSCs	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) enhance the proliferation of endothelial cells to stimulate angiogenesis. However, many aggressive malignant tumors do not have endothelial cell-dependent blood vessels in the early stage and instead generate microcirculation by forming vasculogenic mimicry (VM). To date, the relationship between MDSCs and tumor cells remains the focus of ongoing studies. In this work, MDSCs were co-cultured with mouse melanoma cells and can enhance proliferation and VM formation of melanoma cells. For MDSCs targeting, doxycycline (DOX) was found to selectively suppress PMN-MDSCs but has no influence on T cells. In addition, DOX pretreatment substantially reduced the promoting ability of MDSCs for the VM formation of B16-F10 cells. DOX also inhibited tumor growth and enhanced the antitumor activity of PD-1 inhibitors in C57BL6 and BALB/c mice subcutaneously inoculated with B16-F10 and 4T1 cells, respectively. In conclusion, the combination of DOX and PD-1 inhibitor could be an anticancer strategy.
PXD024450	34841476	CD47 interactions with exportin-1 limit the targeting of m(7)G-modified RNAs to extracellular vesicles. 	CD47 interactions with exportin-1 regulate targeting of m7G-capped RNAs to extracellular vesicles	CD47 interactome, extracellular vesicle	CD47 is a marker of self and a signaling receptor for thrombospondin-1 that is also a component of extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by various cell types. Previous studies identified CD47-dependent functional effects of T cell EVs on target cells, mediated by delivery of their RNA contents, and enrichment of specific subsets of coding and noncoding RNAs in CD47(+) EVs. Mass spectrometry was employed here to identify potential mechanisms by which CD47 regulates the trafficking of specific RNAs to EVs. Specific interactions of CD47 and its cytoplasmic adapter ubiquilin-1 with components of the exportin-1/Ran nuclear export complex were identified and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation. Exportin-1 is known to regulate nuclear to cytoplasmic trafficking of 5'-7-methylguanosine (m(7)G)-modified microRNAs and mRNAs that interact with its cargo protein EIF4E. Interaction with CD47 was inhibited following alkylation of exportin-1 at Cys(528) by its covalent inhibitor leptomycin B. Leptomycin B increased levels of m(7)G-modified RNAs, and their association with exportin-1 in EVs released from wild type but not CD47-deficient cells. In addition to perturbing nuclear to cytoplasmic transport, transcriptomic analyses of EVs released by wild type and CD47-deficient Jurkat T cells revealed a global CD47-dependent enrichment of m(7)G-modified microRNAs and mRNAs in EVs released by CD47-deficient cells. Correspondingly, decreasing CD47 expression in wild type cells or treatment with thrombospondin-1 enhanced levels of specific m(7)G-modified RNAs released in EVs, and re-expressing CD47 in CD47-deficient T cells decreased their levels. Therefore, CD47 signaling limits the trafficking of m(7)G-modified RNAs to EVs through physical interactions with the exportin-1/Ran transport complex.
PXD028248	34841720	The multicellular signalling network of ovarian cancer metastases. 	The intercellular signaling network of ovarian cancer metastases	HSP70, WNT4, adipocyte, carcinoma-associated fibroblast, mesothelial cell, metastasis, omentum, ovarian carcinoma, signaling network, tumor microenvironment	BACKGROUND: Transcoelomic spread is the major route of metastasis of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) with the omentum as the major metastatic site. Its unique tumour microenvironment with its large populations of adipocytes, mesothelial cells and immune cells establishes an intercellular signaling network that is instrumental for metastatic growth yet poorly understood. METHODS: Based on transcriptomic analysis of tumour cells, tumour-associated immune and stroma cells we defined intercellular signaling pathways for 284 cytokines and growth factors and their cognate receptors after bioinformatic adjustment for contaminating cell types. The significance of individual components of this network was validated by analysing clinical correlations and potentially pro-metastatic functions, including tumour cell migration, pro-inflammatory signal transduction and TAM expansion. RESULTS: The data show an unexpected prominent role of host cells, and in particular of omental adipocytes, mesothelial cells and fibroblasts (CAF), in sustaining this signaling network. These cells, rather than tumour cells, are the major source of most cytokines and growth factors in the omental microenvironment (n = 176 vs. n = 13). Many of these factors target tumour cells, are linked to metastasis and are associated with a short survival. Likewise, tumour stroma cells play a major role in extracellular-matrix-triggered signaling. We have verified the functional significance of our observations for three exemplary instances. We show that the omental microenvironment (i) stimulates tumour cell migration and adhesion via WNT4 which is highly expressed by CAF; (ii) induces pro-tumourigenic TAM proliferation in conjunction with high CSF1 expression by omental stroma cells and (iii) triggers pro-inflammatory signaling, at least in part via a HSP70-NF-kappaB pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The intercellular signaling network of omental metastases is majorly dependent on factors secreted by immune and stroma cells to provide an environment that supports ovarian HGSC progression. Clinically relevant pathways within this network represent novel options for therapeutic intervention.
PXD029751	34842814	tRNA Synthetases Are Recruited to Yeast Ribosomes by rRNA Expansion Segment 7L but Do Not Require Association for Functionality. 	tRNA synthetases are recruited to yeast ribosomes by rRNA expansion segment 7L but do not require association for func-tionality	Ribosome biology, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, rRNA expansion segments, translation regulation	Protein biosynthesis is essential for any organism, yet how this process is regulated is not fully understood at the molecular level. During evolution, ribosomal RNA expanded in specific regions, referred to as rRNA expansion segments (ES). First functional roles of these expansions have only recently been discovered. Here we address the role of ES7La located in the large ribosomal subunit for factor recruitment to the yeast ribosome and the potential consequences for translation. Truncation of ES7La has only minor effects on ribosome biogenesis, translation efficiency and cell doubling. Using yeast rRNA deletion strains coupled with ribosome-specific mass spectrometry we analyzed the interactome of ribosomes lacking ES7La. Three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases showed reduced ribosome association. Synthetase activities however remained unaltered suggesting that the pool of aminoacylated tRNAs is unaffected by the ES deletion. These results demonstrated that aminoacylation activities of tRNA synthetases per se do not rely on ribosome association. These findings suggest a role of ribosome-associated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase beyond their core enzymatic functions.
PXD025989	34844491	Significant metabolic alterations in patients with hepatitis B virus replication observed via serum untargeted metabolomics shed new light on hepatitis B virus infection. 	Metabolic characterization of hepatic disease patients with hepatitis B virus DNA replication by untargeted metabolomics	HBV DNA replication, HBV infection, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, untargeted metabolomics.	Until now, the metabolic effects of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication on the progression of hepatic diseases (hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer) and liver functions have remained unexplored. Thus, a total of 199 hepatic disease patients with active and inactive HBV were enrolled in this study to explore serum metabolic characteristics using untargeted metabolomics. Multiple analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), volcano plot and pathway analysis, were used for metabolic data analysis. Additionally, differential metabolites were analysed by commercial databases. A decrease of approximately 0.8-fold in amino acids (L-glutamic acid, D-glutamine and L-tyrosine) and an increase of 2-fold in phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were observed in hepatic disease patients with HBV replication. Moreover, downregulation of arachidonic acid, PC 34:2, sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoylglycerophosphoinositol, and 1-oleoylglycerophosphoinositol by 0.6-fold was also found in the serum of patients with HBV replication. In addition, liver function was significantly different between cirrhosis patients with or without HBV replication (p < .05). In summary, this is the first study to focus on the metabolic changes induced by HBV replication in patients and to compare metabolic alterations in the progression of hepatic disease induced by HBV infection. High levels of amino acid depletion and PC and LPC biosynthesis were primarily observed, which may shed new light on the pathogenesis and treatment of HBV infection.
PXD027310	34846870	Fast Fluoroalkylation of Proteins Uncovers the Structure and Dynamics of Biological Macromolecules. 	Fast Fluoroalkylation of Proteins Uncovers Structure and Dynamics of Biological Macromolecules	ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, Togni reagents, conformational changes, epitope m, fluoroalkylation, hyperva-lent iodine reagents, protein fingerprinting, protein footprinting, protein structure, radical labeling	Covalent labeling of proteins in combination with mass spectrometry has been established as a complementary technique to classical structural methods, such as X-ray, NMR, or cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), used for protein structure determination. Although the current covalent labeling techniques enable the protein solvent accessible areas with sufficient spatial resolution to be monitored, there is still high demand for alternative, less complicated, and inexpensive approaches. Here, we introduce a new covalent labeling method based on fast fluoroalkylation of proteins (FFAP). FFAP uses fluoroalkyl radicals formed by reductive decomposition of Togni reagents with ascorbic acid to label proteins on a time scale of seconds. The feasibility of FFAP to effectively label proteins was demonstrated by monitoring the differential amino acids modification of native horse heart apomyoglobin/holomyoglobin and the human haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex. The obtained data confirmed the Togni reagent-mediated FFAP is an advantageous alternative method for covalent labeling in applications such as protein footprinting and epitope mapping of proteins (and their complexes) in general. Data are accessible via the ProteomeXchange server with the data set identifier PXD027310.
PXD024054	34847359	Global mitochondrial protein import proteomics reveal distinct regulation by translation and translocation machinery. 	Human mitochondrial protein import proteomics LFQ	LFQ, mePROD, mitochondrial import	Most mitochondrial proteins are translated in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria. Mutations in the mitochondrial protein import machinery cause human pathologies. However, a lack of suitable tools to measure protein uptake across the mitochondrial proteome has prevented the identification of specific proteins affected by import perturbation. Here, we introduce mePROD(mt), a pulsed-SILAC based proteomics approach that includes a booster signal to increase the sensitivity for mitochondrial proteins selectively, enabling global dynamic analysis of endogenous mitochondrial protein uptake in cells. We applied mePROD(mt) to determine protein uptake kinetics and examined how inhibitors of mitochondrial import machineries affect protein uptake. Monitoring changes in translation and uptake upon mitochondrial membrane depolarization revealed that protein uptake was extensively modulated by the import and translation machineries via activation of the integrated stress response. Strikingly, uptake changes were not uniform, with subsets of proteins being unaffected or decreased due to changes in translation or import capacity.
PXD025167	34847375	Temporal proteomics reveal specific cell cycle oncoprotein downregulation by p97/VCP inhibition. 	Temporal proteomics of p97/VCP inhibition	Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), HCT116, Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Cancer (B/D-HPP), p97 inhibitor, proteasome inhibitor	Targeting protein quality control (PQC) pathways using proteasome or p97/VCP inhibition can effectively treat blood tumors. However, in solid tumors, only p97/VCP inhibitors are effective. To probe this difference in efficacy, we tracked HCT116 colon cancer cells using temporal proteomics to define the cellular and molecular responses to proteasome and p97 inhibition. Proteins involved in general PQC pathways were similarly upregulated by both treatments, suggesting that the proteotoxic stress caused by inhibitors does not explain the differential therapeutic effectiveness. Unexpectedly, proteins specifically dysregulated by two p97 inhibitors are involved in cell cycle control. Indeed, eleven cell cycle proteins were downregulated by p97 inhibition but not by proteasome inhibition. Western blot analysis validated the degradation of cyclin D1 and Securin, which depends on proteasome but not on p97. Differing regulation of cell cycle proteins by p97 and the proteasome may, therefore, explain the therapeutic efficacy of p97 inhibitors in colon cancer.
PXD027954	34847623	Substrate Profiling of Mitochondrial Caseinolytic Protease P via a Site-Specific Photocrosslinking Approach. 	Substrate profiling of mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P via a site-specific photocrosslinking approach	ClpXP, Mitochondria, Orbitrap Fusion, mtUPR, photoaffinity crosslinking	Approaches for profiling protease substrates are critical for defining protease functions, but remain challenging tasks. We combine genetic code expansion, photocrosslinking and proteomics to identify substrates of the mitochondrial (mt) human caseinolytic protease P (hClpP). Site-specific incorporation of the diazirine-bearing amino acid DiazK into the inner proteolytic chamber of hClpP, followed by UV-irradiation of cells, allows to covalently trap substrate proteins of hClpP and to substantiate hClpP's major involvement in maintaining overall mt homeostasis. In addition to confirming many of the previously annotated hClpP substrates, our approach adds a diverse set of new proteins to the hClpP interactome. Importantly, our workflow allows identifying substrate dynamics upon application of external cues in an unbiased manner. Identification of unique hClpP-substrate proteins upon induction of mt oxidative stress, suggests that hClpP counteracts oxidative stress by processing of proteins that are involved in respiratory chain complex synthesis and maturation as well as in catabolic pathways.
PXD029174	34848703	Cilia locally synthesize proteins to sustain their ultrastructure and functions. 	Proteomics of mouse ependymal cilia	ependyma, motile cilia	Cilia are microtubule-based hair-like organelles propelling locomotion and extracellular liquid flow or sensing environmental stimuli. As cilia are diffusion barrier-gated subcellular compartments, their protein components are thought to come from the cell body through intraflagellar transport or diffusion. Here we show that cilia locally synthesize proteins to maintain their structure and functions. Multicilia of mouse ependymal cells are abundant in ribosomal proteins, translation initiation factors, and RNA, including 18 S rRNA and tubulin mRNA. The cilia actively generate nascent peptides, including those of tubulin. mRNA-binding protein Fmrp localizes in ciliary central lumen and appears to function in mRNA delivery into the cilia. Its depletion by RNAi impairs ciliary local translation and induces multicilia degeneration. Expression of exogenous Fmrp, but not an isoform tethered to mitochondria, rescues the degeneration defects. Therefore, local translation defects in cilia might contribute to the pathology of ciliopathies and other diseases such as Fragile X syndrome.
PXD028888	34848724	Identification of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for parkinsonism using a proteomics approach. 	Identification of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for parkinsonism using a proteomics approach	Parkinson's disease, biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid, multiple system atrophy, selected reaction monitoring	The aim of our study was to investigate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tryptic peptide profiles as potential diagnostic biomarkers for the discrimination of parkinsonian disorders. CSF samples were collected from individuals with parkinsonism, who had an uncertain diagnosis at the time of inclusion and who were followed for up to 12 years in a longitudinal study. We performed shotgun proteomics to identify tryptic peptides in CSF of Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 10), multiple system atrophy patients (MSA, n = 5) and non-neurological controls (n = 10). We validated tryptic peptides with differential levels between PD and MSA using a newly developed selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assay in CSF of PD (n = 46), atypical parkinsonism patients (AP; MSA, n = 17; Progressive supranuclear palsy; n = 8) and non-neurological controls (n = 39). We identified 191 tryptic peptides that differed significantly between PD and MSA, of which 34 met our criteria for SRM development. For 14/34 peptides we confirmed differences between PD and AP. These tryptic peptides discriminated PD from AP with moderate-to-high accuracy. Random forest modelling including tryptic peptides plus either clinical assessments or other CSF parameters (neurofilament light chain, phosphorylated tau protein) and age improved the discrimination of PD vs. AP. Our results show that the discovery of tryptic peptides by untargeted and subsequent validation by targeted proteomics is a suitable strategy to identify potential CSF biomarkers for PD versus AP. Furthermore, the tryptic peptides, and corresponding proteins, that we identified as differential biomarkers may increase our current knowledge about the disease-specific pathophysiological mechanisms of parkinsonism.
PXD026858	34850819	Lipid signatures reflect the function of the murine primary placentation+. 	Proteome analysis of the murine primary placenta	Murine, placenta	The placenta regulates maternal-fetal communication, and its defect leads to significant pregnancy complications. The maternal and embryonic circulations are primitively connected in early placentation, but the function of the placenta during this developmentally essential period is relatively unknown. We thus performed a comparative proteomic analysis of the placenta before and after primary placentation and found that the metabolism and transport of lipids were characteristically activated in this period. The placental fatty acid (FA) carriers in specific placental compartments were upregulated according to gestational age, and metabolomic analysis also showed that the placental transport of FAs increased in a time-dependent manner. Further analysis of two mutant mice models with embryonic lethality revealed that lipid-related signatures could reflect the functional state of the placenta. Our findings highlight the importance of the nutrient transport function of the primary placenta in the early gestational period and the role of lipids in embryonic development. SUMMARY SENTENCE: The placenta is activated characteristically in terms of lipid transport during primary placentation, and the lipid-related signatures closely reflect the functional state of the placenta.
PXD026239	34850936	A distinct complex of PRP19-related and trypanosomatid-specific proteins is required for pre-mRNA splicing in trypanosomes. 	Proteins that co-purify with tandem affinity-purified PRC5 in Trypanosoma brucei	LC/MS/MS, PRP19-related complex, Tandem affinity purification, Trypanosome, spliceosome	The pre-mRNA splicing factor PRP19 is recruited into the spliceosome after forming the PRP19/CDC5L complex in humans and the Nineteen complex in yeast. Additionally, 'PRP19-related' proteins enter the spliceosome individually or in pre-assemblies that differ in these systems. The protistan family Trypanosomatidae, which harbors parasites such as Trypanosoma brucei, diverged early during evolution from opisthokonts. While introns are rare in these organisms, spliced leader trans splicing is an obligatory step in mRNA maturation. So far, ~70 proteins have been identified as homologs of human and yeast splicing factors. Moreover, few proteins of unknown function have recurrently co-purified with splicing proteins. Here we silenced the gene of one of these proteins, termed PRC5, and found it to be essential for cell viability and pre-mRNA splicing. Purification of PRC5 combined with sucrose gradient sedimentation revealed a complex of PRC5 with a second trypanosomatid-specific protein, PRC3, and PRP19-related proteins SYF1, SYF3 and ISY1, which we named PRP19-related complex (PRC). Importantly, PRC and the previously described PRP19 complex are distinct from each other because PRC, unlike PRP19, co-precipitates U4 snRNA, which indicates that PRC enters the spliceosome prior to PRP19 and uncovers a unique pre-organization of these proteins in trypanosomes.
PXD027896	34853303	Cross-species analysis of viral nucleic acid interacting proteins identifies TAOKs as innate immune regulators. 	Cross-species analysis of viral nucleic acid interactors identifies TAOKs as immune regulators	AP-MS	The cell intrinsic antiviral response of multicellular organisms developed over millions of years and critically relies on the ability to sense and eliminate viral nucleic acids. Here we use an affinity proteomics approach in evolutionary distant species (human, mouse and fly) to identify proteins that are conserved in their ability to associate with diverse viral nucleic acids. This approach shows a core of orthologous proteins targeting viral genetic material and species-specific interactions. Functional characterization of the influence of 181 candidates on replication of 6 distinct viruses in human cells and flies identifies 128 nucleic acid binding proteins with an impact on virus growth. We identify the family of TAO kinases (TAOK1, -2 and -3) as dsRNA-interacting antiviral proteins and show their requirement for type-I interferon induction. Depletion of TAO kinases in mammals or flies leads to an impaired response to virus infection characterized by a reduced induction of interferon stimulated genes in mammals and impaired expression of srg1 and diedel in flies. Overall, our study shows a larger set of proteins able to mediate the interaction between viral genetic material and host factors than anticipated so far, attesting to the ancestral roots of innate immunity and to the lineage-specific pressures exerted by viruses.
PXD029061	34853314	Histone variant H2A.Z regulates zygotic genome activation. 	H2A.Z regulates zygotic genome activation	CO-IP MS, H2A.Z, ZGA	During embryogenesis, the genome shifts from transcriptionally quiescent to extensively active in a process known as Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA). In Drosophila, the pioneer factor Zelda is known to be essential for the progression of development; still, it regulates the activation of only a small subset of genes at ZGA. However, thousands of genes do not require Zelda, suggesting that other mechanisms exist. By conducting GRO-seq, HiC and ChIP-seq in Drosophila embryos, we demonstrate that up to 65% of zygotically activated genes are enriched for the histone variant H2A.Z. H2A.Z enrichment precedes ZGA and RNA Polymerase II loading onto chromatin. In vivo knockdown of maternally contributed Domino, a histone chaperone and ATPase, reduces H2A.Z deposition at transcription start sites, causes global downregulation of housekeeping genes at ZGA, and compromises the establishment of the 3D chromatin structure. We infer that H2A.Z is essential for the de novo establishment of transcriptional programs during ZGA via chromatin reorganization.
PXD028751	34853315	Nicotine-mediated OTUD3 downregulation inhibits VEGF-C mRNA decay to promote lymphatic metastasis of human esophageal cancer. 	Identification of OTUD3 interactors in esophageal cancer cell line	Esophageal cancer, OTUD3	Nicotine addiction and the occurrence of lymph node spread are two major significant factors associated with esophageal cancer's poor prognosis; however, nicotine's role in inducing lymphatic metastasis of esophageal cancer remains unclear. Here we show that OTU domain-containing protein 3 (OTUD3) is downregulated by nicotine and correlates with poor prognosis in heavy-smoking esophageal cancer patients. OTUD3 directly interacts with ZFP36 ring finger protein (ZFP36) and stabilizes it by inhibiting FBXW7-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitination. ZFP36 binds with the VEGF-C 3-'UTR and recruits the RNA degrading complex to induce its rapid mRNA decay. Downregulation of OTUD3 and ZFP36 is essential for nicotine-induced VEGF-C production and lymphatic metastasis in esophageal cancer. This study establishes that the OTUD3/ZFP36/VEGF-C axis plays a vital role in nicotine addiction-induced lymphatic metastasis, suggesting that OTUD3 may serve as a prognostic marker, and induction of the VEGF-C mRNA decay might be a potential therapeutic strategy against human esophageal cancer.
PXD028652	34853317	Mounting, structure and autocleavage of a type VI secretion-associated Rhs polymorphic toxin. 	Mounting, structure and autocleavage of a type VI secretion-associated Rhs polymorphic toxin	Re-arrangement hot spot, VgrG, architecture, autocleavage, chaperone, cross-linking, polymorphic toxin, spike, beta-roll	Bacteria have evolved toxins to outcompete other bacteria or to hijack host cell pathways. One broad family of bacterial polymorphic toxins gathers multidomain proteins with a modular organization, comprising a C-terminal toxin domain fused to a N-terminal domain that adapts to the delivery apparatus. Polymorphic toxins include bacteriocins, contact-dependent growth inhibition systems, and specialized Hcp, VgrG, PAAR or Rhs Type VI secretion (T6SS) components. We recently described and characterized Tre23, a toxin domain fused to a T6SS-associated Rhs protein in Photorhabdus laumondii, Rhs1. Here, we show that Rhs1 forms a complex with the T6SS spike protein VgrG and the EagR chaperone. Using truncation derivatives and cross-linking mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that VgrG-EagR-Rhs1 complex formation requires the VgrG C-terminal beta-helix and the Rhs1 N-terminal region. We then report the cryo-electron-microscopy structure of the Rhs1-EagR complex, demonstrating that the Rhs1 central region forms a beta-barrel cage-like structure that encapsulates the C-terminal toxin domain, and provide evidence for processing of the Rhs1 protein through aspartyl autoproteolysis. We propose a model for Rhs1 loading on the T6SS, transport and delivery into the target cell.

In metazoa, RtcB functions as part of a five-subunit tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC) along with Ddx1, Cgi-99, Fam98B, and Ashwin. The human tRNA-LC or its individual subunits have been implicated in additional cellular processes including microRNA maturation, viral replication, DNA double-strand break repair, and mRNA transport. Here, we present a biochemical analysis of the inter-subunit interactions within the human tRNA-LC along with crystal structures of the catalytic subunit RTCB and the N-terminal domain of CGI-99. We show that the core of the human tRNA-LC is assembled from RTCB and the C-terminal alpha-helical regions of DDX1, CGI-99, and FAM98B, all of which are required for complex integrity. The N-terminal domain of CGI-99 displays structural homology to calponin-homology domains, and CGI-99 and FAM98B associate via their N-terminal domains to form a stable subcomplex. The crystal structure of GMP-bound RTCB reveals divalent metal coordination geometry in the active site, providing insights into its catalytic mechanism. Collectively, these findings shed light on the molecular architecture and mechanism of the human tRNA ligase complex and provide a structural framework for understanding its functions in cellular RNA metabolism.
PXD025026	34854563	Goat Milk Exosomes As Natural Nanoparticles for Detecting Inflammatory Processes By Optical Imaging. 	Goat's milk exosomes as natural nanoparticles in detection of inflammatory processes by optical imaging	ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, diagnosis, exosome, inflammation, nanoparticle, optical imaging	Exosomes are cell-derived nanovesicles with a proven intercellular signaling role in inflammation processes and immune response. Due to their natural origin and liposome-like structure, these nanometer-scale vesicles have emerged as novel platforms for therapy and diagnosis. In this work, goat milk exosomes are isolated and fully characterized in terms of their physicochemical properties, proteomics, and biochemical profile in healthy mice, and used to detect inflammatory processes by optical imaging. For the in vitro and in vivo experiments, the exosomes are covalently labeled with the commercial fluorophores sulfo-Cyanine 5 and BODIPY-FL to create nanoprobes. In vitro studies using confocal imaging, flow cytometry, and colorimetric assays confirm the internalization of the nanoprobes as well their lack of cytotoxicity in macrophage populations RAW 264.7. Optical imaging in the mouse peritoneal region confirms the in vivo ability of one of the nanoprobes to localize inflammatory processes. In vivo imaging shows exosome uptake in the inflamed peritoneal region, and flow-cytometric analysis of peritonitis exudates confirms the uptake by macrophage and neutrophil populations. These results support the promising use of goat milk exosomes as natural probes in the detection of inflammatory processes.
PXD020277	34855283	Precision N-glycoproteomics reveals elevated LacdiNAc as a novel signature of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. 	Site-specific N-glycoproteomic analysis of Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and Hepatocellular carcinoma	Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma(ICC), glycoproteome, intact glycopeptide, site-specific glycosylation	Primary liver cancer, mainly comprising hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), remains a major global health problem. Although ICC is clinically different from HCC, their molecular differences are still largely unclear. In this study, precision N-glycoproteomic analysis was performed on both ICC and HCC tumors as well as paracancer tissues to investigate their aberrant site-specific N-glycosylation. By using our newly developed glycoproteomic methods and novel algorithm, termed 'StrucGP', a total of 486 N-glycan structures attached on 1235 glycosites were identified from 894 glycoproteins in ICC and HCC tumors. Notably, glycans with uncommon LacdiNAc (GalNAcbeta1-4GlcNAc) structures were distinguished from their isomeric glycans. In addition to several bi-antennary and/or bisecting glycans that were commonly elevated in ICC and HCC, a number of LacdiNAc-containing, tri-antennary, and core-fucosylated glycans were uniquely increased in ICC. More interestingly, almost all LacdiNAc-containing N-glycopeptides were enhanced in ICC tumor but not in HCC tumor, and this phenomenon was further confirmed by lectin histochemistry and the high expression of beta1-4 GalNAc transferases in ICC at both mRNA and protein expression levels. The novel N-glycan alterations uniquely detected in ICC provide a valuable resource for future studies regarding to the discovery of ICC diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and mechanism investigations.
PXD025435	34856920	Expression of transport proteins in the rete mirabile of european silver and yellow eel. 	Expression of transport proteins in the rete mirabile of European silver and yellow eel	Anguilla Anguilla, European eel, iTRAQ, rete mirabile	BACKGROUND: In physoclist fishes filling of the swimbladder requires acid secretion of gas gland cells to switch on the Root effect and subsequent countercurrent concentration of the initial gas partial pressure increase by back-diffusion of gas molecules in the rete mirabile. It is generally assumed that the rete mirabile functions as a passive exchanger, but a detailed analysis of lactate and water movements in the rete mirabile of the eel revealed that lactate is diffusing back in the rete. In the present study we therefore test the hypothesis that expression of transport proteins in rete capillaries allows for back-diffusion of ions and metabolites, which would support the countercurrent concentrating capacity of the rete mirabile. It is also assumed that in silver eels, the migratory stage of the eel, the expression of transport proteins would be enhanced. RESULTS: Analysis of the transcriptome and of the proteome of rete mirabile tissue of the European eel revealed the expression of a large number of membrane ion and metabolite transport proteins, including monocarboxylate and glucose transport proteins. In addition, ion channel proteins, Ca(2+)-ATPase, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and also F1F0-ATP synthase were detected. In contrast to our expectation in silver eels the expression of these transport proteins was not elevated as compared to yellow eels. A remarkable number of enzymes degrading reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected in rete capillaries. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the expression of a large number of transport proteins in rete capillaries, so that the back diffusion of ions and metabolites, in particular lactate, may significantly enhance the countercurrent concentrating ability of the rete. Metabolic pathways allowing for aerobic generation of ATP supporting secondary active transport mechanisms are established. Rete tissue appears to be equipped with a high ROS defense capacity, preventing damage of the tissue due to the high oxygen partial pressures generated in the countercurrent system.
PXD026598	34856929	Identification of proteins associated with bast fiber growth of ramie by differential proteomic analysis. 	Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis for protein expression	differential expression, ramie	BACKGROUND: Ramie is an important fiber-producing crop in China, and its fibers are widely used as textile materials. Fibers contain specialized secondary cellular walls that are mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. Understanding the mechanism underlying the secondary wall biosynthesis of fibers will benefit the improvement of fiber yield and quality in ramie. RESULTS: Here, we performed a proteomic analysis of the bark from the top and middle parts of the stem, where fiber growth is at different stages. We identified 6971 non-redundant proteins from bast bark. Proteomic comparison revealed 983 proteins with differential expression between the two bark types. Of these 983 proteins, 46 were identified as the homolog of known secondary wall biosynthetic proteins of Arabidopsis, indicating that they were potentially associated with fiber growth. Then, we proposed a molecular model for the secondary wall biosynthesis of ramie fiber. Furthermore, interaction analysis of 46 candidate proteins revealed two interacting networks that consisted of eight cellulose biosynthetic enzymes and seven lignin biosynthetic proteins, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study sheds light on the proteomic basis underlying bast fiber growth in ramie, and the identification of many candidates associated with fiber growth provides important basis for understanding the fiber growth in this crop.
PXD025191	34857819	A single dose of Ultraviolet-A induces proteome remodeling and senescence in primary human keratinocytes. 	A single dose of Ultraviolet-A induces proteome remodeling and senescence in primary human keratinocytes	HaCaT, NHEK, UVA light, keratinocytes, orbitrap fusion lumos, senescence, shotgun	Epidermal photoaging contributes to skin fragility over time and it is a risk factor for skin cancer. Photoaging has been associated for a long time with exposure to Ultraviolet-A (UVA) light, the predominant component of the solar ultraviolet radiation. While the cellular mechanisms underlying UVA-induced photoaging in the dermis have been well characterized, UVA's action on the epidermis remains elusive. Here, proteomic analysis was conducted to derive the cellular responses induced by an environmentally relevant dose of UVA in primary human keratinocytes. We also investigated the effects of UVA on non-transformed immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT cells), bearing potentially oncogenic mutations. We showed that UVA induces proteome remodeling and senescence in primary keratinocytes, eliciting potent antioxidant and pro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, we showed that UVA modulates the secretory phenotype of these cells to the extent of inducing paracrine oxidative stress and immune system activation in pre-malignant keratinocytes. These observations offer insights into the cellular mechanisms by which UVA drives photoaging in the skin.
PXD029167	34858420	Targeted Mass Spectrometry Enables Multiplexed Quantification of Immunomodulatory Proteins in Clinical Biospecimens. 	Targeted mass spectrometry enables multiplexed quantification of immunomodulatory proteins in clinical biospecimens	cancer, immuno-MRM, immuno-oncology, immunotherapeutics, peptide immunoaffinity enrichment	Immunotherapies are revolutionizing cancer care, producing durable responses and potentially cures in a subset of patients. However, response rates are low for most tumors, grade 3/4 toxicities are not uncommon, and our current understanding of tumor immunobiology is incomplete. While hundreds of immunomodulatory proteins in the tumor microenvironment shape the anti-tumor response, few of them can be reliably quantified. To address this need, we developed a multiplex panel of targeted proteomic assays targeting 52 peptides representing 46 proteins using peptide immunoaffinity enrichment coupled to multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry. We validated the assays in tissue and plasma matrices, where performance figures of merit showed over 3 orders of dynamic range and median inter-day CVs of 5.2% (tissue) and 21% (plasma). A feasibility study in clinical biospecimens showed detection of 48/52 peptides in frozen tissue and 38/52 peptides in plasma. The assays are publicly available as a resource for the research community.
PXD024349	34858452	LC-MS Based Draft Map of the Arabidopsis thaliana Nuclear Proteome and Protein Import in Pattern Triggered Immunity. 	LC-MS Based Draft Map of the Arabidopsis thaliana Nuclear Proteome and Protein Import in Pattern Triggered Immunity	Nuclear proteome, Nucleus, flg22, nlp20, stress response	Despite its central role as the ark of genetic information and gene expression the plant nucleus is surprisingly understudied. We isolated nuclei from the Arabidopsis thaliana dark grown cell culture left untreated and treated with flg22 and nlp20, two elicitors of pattern triggered immunity (PTI) in plants, respectively. An liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based discovery proteomics approach was used to measure the nuclear proteome fractions. An enrichment score based on the relative abundance of cytoplasmic, mitochondrial and Golgi markers in the nuclear protein fraction allowed us to curate the nuclear proteome producing high quality catalogs of around 3,000 nuclear proteins under untreated and both PTI conditions. The measurements also covered low abundant proteins including more than 100 transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators. We disclose a list of several hundred potentially dual targeted proteins including proteins not yet found before for further study. Protein import into the nucleus in plant immunity is known. Here we sought to gain a broader impression of this phenomenon employing our proteomics data and found 157 and 73 proteins to possibly be imported into the nucleus upon stimulus with flg22 and nlp20, respectively. Furthermore, the abundance of 93 proteins changed significantly in the nucleus following elicitation of immunity. These results suggest promiscuous ribosome assembly and a role of prohibitins and cytochrome C in the nucleus in PTI.
PXD027512	34858456	Protein Phosphorylation Changes During Systemic Acquired Resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. 	Phosphorylation events during systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis	phosphoprotemics DIA	Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants is a defense response that provides resistance against a wide range of pathogens at the whole-plant level following primary infection. Although the molecular mechanisms of SAR have been extensively studied in recent years, the role of phosphorylation that occurs in systemic leaves of SAR-induced plants is poorly understood. We used a data-independent acquisition (DIA) phosphoproteomics platform based on high-resolution mass spectrometry in an Arabidopsis thaliana model to identify phosphoproteins related to SAR establishment. A total of 8011 phosphorylation sites from 3234 proteins were identified in systemic leaves of Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola ES4326 (Psm ES4326) and mock locally inoculated plants. A total of 859 significantly changed phosphoproteins from 1119 significantly changed phosphopeptides were detected in systemic leaves of Psm ES4326 locally inoculated plants, including numerous transcription factors and kinases. A variety of defense response-related proteins were found to be differentially phosphorylated in systemic leaves of Psm ES4326 locally inoculated leaves, suggesting that these proteins may be functionally involved in SAR through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. Significantly changed phosphoproteins were enriched mainly in categories related to response to abscisic acid, regulation of stomatal movement, plant-pathogen interaction, MAPK signaling pathway, purine metabolism, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, and flavonoid biosynthesis. A total of 28 proteins were regulated at both protein and phosphorylation levels during SAR. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that changes in phosphorylation levels of proteins during SAR did not result from changes in transcript abundance. This study provides comprehensive details of key phosphoproteins associated with SAR, which will facilitate further research on the molecular mechanisms of SAR.
PXD025779	34858827	Topical Application of Temperature-Sensitive Gel Containing Caerin 1.1 and 1.9 Peptides on TC-1 Tumour-Bearing Mice Induced High-Level Immune Response in the Tumour Microenvironment. 	Topical application of temperature sensitive gel containing caerin 1.1 and 1.9 peptides on TC-1 tumour bearing mice modulates heterogeneity of macrophage and dendritic cell in the tumour microenvironment	CD8+ T cell, TC-1 cell, caerin peptide, cervical cancer, tumour microenvironment	The development of topical cream drugs that increase the immune activation of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes against tumour and chronic viral infection-associated lesions is of great immunotherapeutic significance. This study demonstrates that the topical application of a temperature-sensitive gel containing caerin 1.1 and 1.9 peptides reduces nearly 50% of the tumour weight of HPV16 E6/E7-transformed TC-1 tumour-bearing mice via improving the tumour microenvironment. Confocal microscopy confirms the time-dependent penetration of caerin 1.9 through the epidermal layer of the ear skin structure of mice. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis shows that the caerin 1.1/1.9 gel expands the populations with high immune activation level and largely stimulates the pro-inflammatory activity of NK and dendritic cells. Closely associated with INFalpha response, Cebpb seems to play a key role in altering the function of all Arg1(hi) macrophages in the caerin group. In addition, the caerin gel treatment recruits almost two-fold more activated CD8(+) T cells to the TME, relative to the untreated tumour, which shows a synergistic effect derived from the regulation of S1pr1, Ccr7, Ms4a4b and Gimap family expression. The TMT10plex-labelling proteomic quantification further demonstrates the activation of interferon-alpha/beta secretion and response to cytokine stimulus by the caerin gel, while the protein contents of several key regulators were elevated by more than 30%, such as Cd5l, Gzma, Ifit1, Irf9 and Stat1. Computational integration of the proteome with the single-cell transcriptome consistently suggested greater activation of NK and T cells with the topical application of caerin peptide gel.
PXD028848	34858981	Identification of ACTA2 as a Key Contributor to Venous Malformation. 	i.e.Human Veinou malformation.iTraq/TMT	Vein, i.e.Human, iTraq/TMT	Objectives: Proteomics and high connotation functional gene screening (HCS) were used to screen key functional genes that play important roles in the pathogenesis of venous malformation. Furthermore, this study was conducted to analyze and explore their possible functions, establish a gene mutation zebrafish model, and perform a preliminary study to explore their possible pathogenic mechanisms in venous malformation. Methods: Pathological and normal tissues from patients with disseminated venous malformation were selected for Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomics analysis to identify proteins that were differentially expressed. Based on bioinformatics analysis, 20 proteins with significant differential expression were selected for HCS to find key driver genes and characterize the expression of these genes in patients with venous malformations. In vitro experiments were then performed using human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). A gene mutant zebrafish model was also constructed for in vivo experiments to explore gene functions and pathogenic mechanisms. Results: The TMT results showed a total of 71 proteins that were differentially expressed as required, with five of them upregulated and 66 downregulated. Based on bioinformatics and proteomics results, five highly expressed genes and 15 poorly expressed genes were selected for functional screening by RNAi technology. HCS screening identified ACTA2 as the driver gene. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot were used to detect the expression of ACTA2 in the pathological tissues of patients with venous malformations and in control tissues, and the experimental results showed a significantly lower expression of ACTA2 in venous malformation tissues (P < 0.05). Cell assays on the human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) model showed that cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenic ability were all significantly increased in the ACTA2 over-expression group (P < 0.05), and that overexpression of ACTA2 could improve the inhibitory effect on vascular endothelial cell proliferation. We constructed an ACTA2-knockdown zebrafish model and found that the knockdown of ACTA2 resulted in defective vascular development, disruption of vascular integrity, and malformation of micro vein development in zebrafish. Further qPCR assays revealed that the knockdown of ACTA2 inhibited the Dll4/notch1 signaling pathway, Ephrin-B2 signaling pathway, and vascular integrity-related molecules and activated the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Conclusion: This study revealed that ACTA2 deficiency is an important factor in the pathogenesis of venous malformation, resulting in the disruption of vascular integrity and malformed vascular development. ACTA2 can be used as a potential biomarker for the treatment and prognosis of venous malformations.
PXD024912	34859122	Thermal Proteome Profiling to Identify Protein-ligand Interactions in the Apicomplexan Parasite Toxoplasma gondii. 	T. gondii TIR1 strain temperature range thermal profiling experiment	CETSA, TPP, Toxoplasma, parasite	Toxoplasma gondii is a single-celled eukaryotic parasite that chronically infects a quarter of the global population. In recent years, phenotypic screens have identified compounds that block parasite replication. Unraveling the pathways and molecular mechanisms perturbed by such compounds requires target deconvolution. In parasites, such deconvolution has been achieved via chemogenomic approaches-for example, directed evolution followed by whole-genome sequencing or genome-wide knockout screens. As a proteomic alternative that directly probes the physical interaction between compound and protein, thermal proteome profiling (TPP), also known as the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), recently emerged as a method to identify small molecule-target interactions in living cells and cell extracts in a variety of organisms, including unicellular eukaryotic pathogens. Ligand binding induces a thermal stability shift-stabilizing or destabilizing proteins that change conformationally in response to the ligand-that can be measured by mass spectrometry (MS). Cells are incubated with different concentrations of ligand and heated, causing thermal denaturation of proteins. The soluble protein is extracted and quantified with multiplexed, quantitative MS, resulting in thousands of thermal denaturation profiles. Proteins engaging the ligand can be identified by their compound-dependent thermal shift. The protocol provided here can be used to identify ligand-target interactions and assess the impact of environmental or genetic perturbations on the thermal stability of the proteome in T. gondii and other eukaryotic pathogens. Graphic abstract: Thermal proteome profiling for target identification in the apicomplexan parasite T. gondii.
PXD025255	34860524	Automated High-Throughput Method for the Fast, Robust, and Reproducible Enrichment of Newly Synthesized Proteins. 	Automated method for enrichment of newly synthesized proteins based on AHA labeling	AHA, Click chemistry, High throughput, LC-MS, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, enrichment, interferon, melanoma, newly synthesized proteins	A high-throughput method was developed for the automated enrichment of newly synthesized proteins (NSPs), which are labeled metabolically by substituting methionine with the "click-able" analogue azidohomoalanine (AHA). A suitable conjugate containing a dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) group allows the specific selection of NSPs by a fast 1 h click chemistry-based reaction with AHA. Through an automated pipetting platform, the samples are loaded into streptavidin cartridges for the selective binding of the NSPs by means of a biotin bait contained in the conjugate. The enriched proteins are eluted by a reproducible chemical cleavage of the 4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene (Dde) group in the conjugate, which increases selectivity. The NSPs can be collected and digested in the same well plate, and the resulting peptides can be subsequently loaded for automated cleanup, followed by mass spectrometry analysis. The proposed automated method allows for the robust and effective enrichment of samples in 96-well plates in a period of 3 h. Our developed enrichment method was comprehensively evaluated and then applied to the proteomics analysis of the melanoma A375 cell secretome, after treatment with the cytokines interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) and gamma (IFN-gamma), resulting in the quantification of 283 and 263 proteins, respectively, revealing intricate tumor growth-supportive and -suppressive effects.
PXD026411	34860542	MON-2, a Golgi protein, mediates autophagy-dependent longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. 	Quantitative proteome for C.elegans by 3plex mTRAQ	C. elegans, mTRAQ	The Golgi apparatus plays a central role in trafficking cargoes such as proteins and lipids. Defects in the Golgi apparatus lead to various diseases, but its role in organismal longevity is largely unknown. Using a quantitative proteomic approach, we found that a Golgi protein, MON-2, was up-regulated in long-lived Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with mitochondrial respiration defects and was required for their longevity. Similarly, we showed that DOP1/PAD-1, which acts with MON-2 to traffic macromolecules between the Golgi and endosome, contributed to the longevity of respiration mutants. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MON-2 was required for up-regulation of autophagy, a longevity-associated recycling process, by activating the Atg8 ortholog GABARAP/LGG-1 in C. elegans. Consistently, we showed that mammalian MON2 activated GABARAPL2 through physical interaction, which increased autophagic flux in mammalian cells. Thus, the evolutionarily conserved role of MON2 in trafficking between the Golgi and endosome is an integral part of autophagy-mediated longevity.
PXD016019	34860583	DDX17 is an essential mediator of sterile NLRC4 inflammasome activation by retrotransposon RNAs. 	SINE RNAs trigger noncanonical NLRC4 inflammasome via DDX17	AMD, DDX17, Inflammasome, SINE	Detection of microbial products by multiprotein complexes known as inflammasomes is pivotal to host defense against pathogens. Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) CARD domain containing 4 (NLRC4) forms an inflammasome in response to bacterial products; this requires their detection by NLR family apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs), with which NLRC4 physically associates. However, the mechanisms underlying sterile NLRC4 inflammasome activation, which is implicated in chronic noninfectious diseases, remain unknown. Here, we report that endogenous short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) RNAs, which promote atrophic macular degeneration (AMD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), induce NLRC4 inflammasome activation independent of NAIPs. We identify DDX17, a DExD/H box RNA helicase, as the sensor of SINE RNAs that licenses assembly of an inflammasome comprising NLRC4, NLR pyrin domain-containing protein 3, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein-containing CARD and induces caspase-1 activation and cytokine release. Inhibiting DDX17-mediated NLRC4 inflammasome activation decreased interleukin-18 release in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with SLE and prevented retinal degeneration in an animal model of AMD. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized noncanonical NLRC4 inflammasome activated by endogenous retrotransposons and provide potential therapeutic targets for SINE RNA-driven diseases.
PXD026219	34862379	High-intensity training induces non-stoichiometric changes in the mitochondrial proteome of human skeletal muscle without reorganisation of respiratory chain content. 	Training-induced bioenergetic improvement in human skeletal muscle is associated with non-stoichiometric changes in the mitochondrial proteome without reorganisation of respiratory chain content	OXPHOS, energy metabolism, exercise, fat metabolism, lipidomics, mitochondria, transcriptomics	Mitochondrial defects are implicated in multiple diseases and aging. Exercise training is an accessible, inexpensive therapeutic intervention that can improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and quality of life. By combining multiple omics techniques with biochemical and in silico normalisation, we removed the bias arising from the training-induced increase in mitochondrial content to unearth an intricate and previously undemonstrated network of differentially prioritised mitochondrial adaptations. We show that changes in hundreds of transcripts, proteins, and lipids are not stoichiometrically linked to the overall increase in mitochondrial content. Our findings suggest enhancing electron flow to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is more important to improve ATP generation than increasing the abundance of the OXPHOS machinery, and do not support the hypothesis that training-induced supercomplex formation enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics. Our study provides an analytical approach allowing unbiased and in-depth investigations of training-induced mitochondrial adaptations, challenging our current understanding, and calling for careful reinterpretation of previous findings.
PXD028726	34867191	Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Mouse Sciatic Nerve Reveals Post-injury Upregulation of ADP-Dependent Glucokinase Promoting Macrophage Phagocytosis. 	Quantitative proteomic analysis of the injured sciatic nerve of wild-type and WldS mice	TMT, neuroimmune, sciatic nerve injury	Nerve injury induces profound and complex changes at molecular and cellular levels, leading to axonal self-destruction as well as immune and inflammatory responses that may further promote neurodegeneration. To better understand how neural injury changes the proteome within the injured nerve, we set up a mouse model of sciatic nerve injury (SNI) and conducted an unbiased, quantitative proteomic study followed by biochemical assays to confirm some of the changed proteins. Among them, the protein levels of ADP-dependent glucokinase (ADPGK) were significantly increased in the injured sciatic nerve. Further examination indicated that ADPGK was specifically expressed and upregulated in macrophages but not neurons or Schwann cells upon injury. Furthermore, culturing immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs) in vitro with the conditioned media from transected axons of mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons induced ADPGK upregulation in iBMDMs, suggesting that injured axons could promote ADPGK expression in macrophages non-cell autonomously. Finally, we showed that overexpression of ADPGK per se did not activate macrophages but promoted the phagocytotic activity of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-treated macrophages. Together, this proteomic analysis reveals interesting changes of many proteins within the injured nerve and our data identify ADPGK as an important in vivo booster of injury-induced macrophage phagocytosis.
PXD028282	34867272	Microdissected Pyramidal Cell Proteomics of Alzheimer Brain Reveals Alterations in Creatine Kinase B-Type, 14-3-3-gamma, and Heat Shock Cognate 71. 	Microdissected pyramidal cell proteomics of Alzheimer brain reveals alterations in Creatine Kinase B, 14-3-3-g and Heat Shock Cognate 71	Alzheimer disease, O18 labelling, Q Exactive, homo sapiens, quantitative MS	Novel insights on proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed. Since multiple cell types and matrix components are altered in AD, bulk analysis of brain tissue maybe difficult to interpret. In the current study, we isolated pyramidal cells from the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus from five AD and five neurologically healthy donors using laser capture microdissection (LCM). The samples were analyzed by proteomics using (18)O-labeled internal standard and nano-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for relative quantification. Fold change between AD and control was calculated for the proteins that were identified in at least two individual proteomes from each group. From the 10 cases analyzed, 62 proteins were identified in at least two AD cases and two control cases. Creatine kinase B-type (CKB), 14-3-3-gamma, and heat shock cognate 71 (Hsc71), which have not been extensively studied in the context of the human AD brain previously, were selected for further studies by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In hippocampus, semi-quantitative measures of IHC staining of the three proteins confirmed the findings from our proteomic analysis. Studies of the same proteins in the frontal cortex revealed that the alterations remained for CKB and 14-3-3-gamma but not for Hsc71. Protein upregulation in CA1 neurons of final stage AD is either a result of detrimental, pathological effects, or from cell-specific protective response mechanisms in surviving neurons. Based on previous findings from experimental studies, CKB and Hsc71 likely exhibit protective effects, whereas 14-3-3-gamma may represent a detrimental pathway. These new players could reflect pathways of importance for the development of new therapeutic strategies.
PXD029210	34867887	Influence of Polysaccharides From Polygonatum kingianum on Short-Chain Fatty Acid Production and Quorum Sensing in Lactobacillus faecis. 	Influence of polysaccharides from Polygonatum kingianum on short-chain fatty acid production and quorum sensing in Lactobacillus faecis	Lactobacillus faecis	Polysaccharide is one of the main active ingredients of Polygonatum kingianum, which has been proven to regulate the balance of gut microbiota. For the first time, this study focused on the regulation of polysaccharides from Polygonatum kingianum (PS) on Lactobacillus faecis, a specific probiotic in the intestinal tract. PS effectively promoted the biomass, biofilm and acetic acid production in L. faecis 2-84, and enhanced quorum sensing (QS) signaling. The characteristics of gene sequence were analyzed using genomics approaches, and L. faecis 2-84 was found to encode 18 genes that are closely related to QS and 10 genes related to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Additionally, transcriptome and proteome analysis demonstrated that PS could promote the QS system of L. faecis by enhancing the transcription of oppA gene and expression of oppD protein. PS also regulated the production and metabolism of SCFAs of L. faecis by upregulating the expression of ldh and metE gene and adh2 protein, and downregulating the expression of mvK gene. In conclusion, it was speculated that PS could affect intestinal SCFAs production by affecting the QS system and SCFAs production in L. faecis. The present study implied that PS might have a role in promoting the growth of intestinal probiotics, where the QS system and SCFAs might be two of the important mechanisms for the probiotic activity of PS.
PXD029488	34868196	Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification-Based Proteomics Reveals Candidate Proteins of Fat Deposition in Chinese Indigenous Sheep With Morphologically Different Tails. 	iTRAQ-based Proteomics Reveals Candidate Proteins of Fat Deposition in Chinese Indigenous Sheep with Morphologically Different Tails	fat deposit, iTRAQ, sheep, type of tail	Background: Chinese indigenous sheep can be classified into two types according to their tail morphology: fat-rumped and thin-tailed sheep, of which the typical breeds are Altay sheep and Tibetan sheep, respectively. Methods: To identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) underlying the phenotypic differences between tail types, we used isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) combined with multi-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technology to detect candidate proteins. We then subjected these to a database search and identified the DEPs. Finally, bioinformatics technology was used to carry out Gene Ontology (GO) functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Results: A total of 3,248 proteins were identified, of which 44 were up-regulated and 40 were down-regulated DEPs. Analyzing their GO function terms and KEGG pathways revealed that the functions of these DEPs are mainly binding, catalytic activity, structural molecule activity, molecular function regulator, and transporter activity. Among the genes encoding the DEPs, APOA2, GALK1, ADIPOQ, and NDUFS4 are associated with fat formation and metabolism. Conclusion: The APOA2, GALK1, ADIPOQ, and NDUFS4 genes may be involved in the deposition of fat in the tail of sheep. This study provides a scientific basis for the breeding of thin-tailed sheep.

Site-specific glycosylation patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spike derived from recombinant protein and viral WA1 and D614G strains	Glycosylation, SARS-CoV-2, WA1 and D614G	The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is heavily glycosylated, having 22 predicted N-glycosylation sites per monomer. It is also O-glycosylated, although the number of O-glycosites is less defined. Recent studies show that spike protein glycans play critical roles in viral entry and infection. The spike monomer has two subdomains, S1 and S2, and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 domain. In this study, we have characterized the site-specific glycosylation patterns of the HEK293 recombinant spike RBD and S1 domains as well as the intact spike derived from the whole virus produced in Vero cells. The Vero cell-derived spike from the WA1 strain and a D614G variant was analyzed. All spike proteins, S1, and RBDs were analyzed using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer. N-glycans identified in HEK293-derived S1 were structurally diverse. Those found in the HEK293-derived RBD were highly similar to those in HEK293 S1 where N-glycosites were shared. Comparison of the whole cell-derived WA1 and D614G spike proteins revealed that N-glycosites local to the mutation site appeared to be more readily detected, hinting that these sites are more exposed to glycosylation machinery. Moreover, recombinant HEK293-derived S1 was occupied almost completely with complex glycan, while both WA1 and D614G derived from the Vero E6 cell whole virus were predominantly high-mannose glycans. This stands in stark contrast to glycosylation patterns seen in both CHO- and HEK cell-derived recombinant S1, S2, and the whole spike previously reported. Concerning O-glycosylation, our analyses revealed that HEK293 recombinant proteins possessed a range of O-glycosites with compositions consistent with Core type 1 and 2 glycans. The O-glycosites shared between the S1 and RBD constructs, sites T323 and T523, were occupied by a similar range of Core 1 and 2 type O-glycans. Overall, this study reveals that the sample nature and cell substrate used for production of these proteins can have a dramatic impact on the glycosylation profile. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycans are associated with host ACE2 receptor interaction efficiency. Therefore, understanding such differences will serve to better understand these host-pathogen interactions and inform the choice of cell substrates to suite downstream investigations.
PXD020548	34870237	Proteogenomics of non-small cell lung cancer reveals molecular subtypes associated with specific therapeutic targets and immune evasion mechanisms. 	Human lung cancer data independent acquisition validation tissue cohort	DIA, classification, lung cancer, tissue, validation	Despite major advancements in lung cancer treatment, long-term survival is still rare, and a deeper understanding of molecular phenotypes would allow the identification of specific cancer dependencies and immune evasion mechanisms. Here we performed in-depth mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteogenomic analysis of 141 tumors representing all major histologies of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We identified six distinct proteome subtypes with striking differences in immune cell composition and subtype-specific expression of immune checkpoints. Unexpectedly, high neoantigen burden was linked to global hypomethylation and complex neoantigens mapped to genomic regions, such as endogenous retroviral elements and introns, in immune-cold subtypes. Further, we linked immune evasion with LAG3 via STK11 mutation-dependent HNF1A activation and FGL1 expression. Finally, we develop a data-independent acquisition MS-based NSCLC subtype classification method, validate it in an independent cohort of 208 NSCLC cases and demonstrate its clinical utility by analyzing an additional cohort of 84 late-stage NSCLC biopsy samples.
PXD025905	34870900	A comparative study of data-dependent acquisition and data-independent acquisition in proteomics analysis of clinical lung cancer tissues constrained by blood contamination. 	A comparative study of data-dependent acquisition and data-independent acquisition in proteomics analysis of clinical lung cancer tissues constrained by blood contamination	data-Independent acquisition (DIA), data-dependent acquisition (DDA), differentially expressed proteins, lung cancer	Proteomics analysis is often troubled by high-abundance proteins in samples such as plasma. However, many surgical tissue samples inevitably have got contaminated with blood before cryopreservation. Selection of an appropriate method to minimize the effect of high-abundance proteins is important for proteomics analysis of blood contaminated tissues. Here, we investigated and compared the abilities of data-independent acquisition (DIA) and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) strategies for the proteomics analysis of blood contaminated clinical tissue samples. Twelve pairs of carcinoma and para-carcinoma tissue samples from lung cancer patients were used for proteomics assays separately by DIA and DDA, and the blood contamination level in samples was evaluated by contamination index (CI). Compared with the DDA strategy, DIA in whole exhibited much better analytical capabilities in proteomics analysis of these samples with more identified protein groups and a higher discovery of differential proteins. With CI value increasing, whether DIA or DDA showed decreasing analysis ability. However, for samples with high CI values, the DIA strategy still shows acceptable analytical capability and indicates better blood pollution resistance than the DDA strategy. Our results implied that for clinical tissue samples, particularly for those contaminated with blood, DIA strategy should be a preferred method in proteomics studies.
PXD027111	34871540	Identification of novel combined biomarkers in the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. 	The plasma proteins from human multiple myeloma was enriched by lectin AANL6 and  identified by LC-MS/MS	Lectin AANL6, MM, Plasma	PURPOSE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a haematological malignant disease with a clonal proliferation of plasma cells, and timely surveillance is helpful to improve the survival rate of patients with MM. However, there is a lack of simple and effective biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis, and residual disease evaluation of MM. MATERIAL & METHODS: In the detection cohort, we used the samples from six newly diagnosed MM patients and six control subjects. Plasma proteins were labelled with dimethyl reagents and enriched by lectin AANL6, then the deglycosylated peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS. Differentially expressed proteins were used for further exploration. In the validation cohort, we used 90 newly diagnosed patients with MM and 70 cases of unrelated diseases as controls. The diagnosis performance was analysed by ROC analysis using SPSS. RESULTS: In this study, we show, using lectin blots with AANL6, that glycosylation levels were higher in MM patients than in controls. After AANL6 enrichment, we detected 58 differentially expressed proteins using quantitative proteomics. We further validated one candidate Fibulin-1 (FBLN1). Using an Elisa assay, we showed that FBLN1 expression was increased in plasma of 90 cases of MM, and which was significantly correlated with DKK1 expression. ROC analysis showed that these two markers had a 95.7% specificity for determining the diagnosis of MM. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the MM cases display increased glycosylation after AANL6 enrichment and that the combined expression of FBLN1 and DKK1 can be used as an effective diagnostic biomarker.
PXD029173	34871808	In-Depth Comparison of Matrigel Dissolving Methods on Proteomic Profiling of Organoids. 	The influence of different Matrigel dissolving methods on proteome research of human derived organoids	Matrigel, gastric cancer organoids	Patient-derived organoids recently emerged as promising ex vivo 3D culture models recapitulating histological and molecular characteristics of original tissues, thus proteomic profiling of organoids could be valuable for function investigation and clinical translation. However, organoids are usually cultured in murine Matrigel (served as scaffolds and matrix), which brings an issue to separate organoids from Matrigel. Because of the complex compositions of Matrigel and thousands of identical peptides shared between Matrigel and organoids, insufficiently dissolved Matrigel could influence proteomic analysis of organoids in multiple ways. Thus, how to dissolve Matrigel matrix and recovery organoid cells efficiently is vital for sample preparation. Here, we comprehensively compared three popular Matrigel dissolving methods (cell recovery solution, dispase, and PBS-EDTA buffer) and investigated the effect of undissolved Matrigel proteins on proteomic profiles of organoids. By integrative analysis of label-free proteomes of Matrigel and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture proteomes of organoids collected by three methods, respectively, we found that dispase showed an optimal efficiency, with the highest peptide yield and the highest incorporation ratio of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture labels (97.1%), as well as with the least potential Matrigel contaminants. To help analysis of proteomic profiles of organoids collected by the other two methods, we identified 312 high-confidence Matrigel contaminants, which could be filtered out to attenuate Matrigel interference with minimal loss of biological information. Together, our study identifies bioinformatics and experimental approaches to eliminate interference of Matrigel contaminants efficiently, which will be valuable for basic and translational proteomic research using organoid models.
PXD026076	34874173	Combined Quantitative (Phospho)proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Imaging Reveal Temporal and Spatial Protein Changes in Human Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion. 	Identification of ischemia-reperfusion induced protein changes in human intestine using quantitative (phospho)proteomics and MALDI mass spectrometry imaging	intestine, ischemia, phosphoproteomics, reperfusion	Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a severe clinical condition, and unraveling its pathophysiology is crucial to improve therapeutic strategies and reduce the high morbidity and mortality rates. Here, we studied the dynamic proteome and phosphoproteome in the human intestine during ischemia and reperfusion, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to gain quantitative information of thousands of proteins and phosphorylation sites, as well as mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to obtain spatial information. We identified a significant decrease in abundance of proteins related to intestinal absorption, microvillus, and cell junction, whereas proteins involved in innate immunity, in particular the complement cascade, and extracellular matrix organization increased in abundance after IR. Differentially phosphorylated proteins were involved in RNA splicing events and cytoskeletal and cell junction organization. In addition, our analysis points to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) families to be active kinases during IR. Finally, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MSI presented peptide alterations in abundance and distribution, which resulted, in combination with Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MSI and LC-MS/MS, in the annotation of proteins related to RNA splicing, the complement cascade, and extracellular matrix organization. This study expanded our understanding of the molecular changes that occur during IR in the human intestine and highlights the value of the complementary use of different MS-based methodologies.
PXD023690	34876567	Spatial-proteomics reveals phospho-signaling dynamics at subcellular resolution. 	Spatial-proteomics reveals phospho-signaling dynamics at subcellular resolution	DIA, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, phosphoproteomics, spatio-temporal dynamics	Dynamic change in subcellular localization of signaling proteins is a general concept that eukaryotic cells evolved for eliciting a coordinated response to stimuli. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics in combination with subcellular fractionation can provide comprehensive maps of spatio-temporal regulation of protein networks in cells, but involves laborious workflows that does not cover the phospho-proteome level. Here we present a high-throughput workflow based on sequential cell fractionation to profile the global proteome and phospho-proteome dynamics across six distinct subcellular fractions. We benchmark the workflow by studying spatio-temporal EGFR phospho-signaling dynamics in vitro in HeLa cells and in vivo in mouse tissues. Finally, we investigate the spatio-temporal stress signaling, revealing cellular relocation of ribosomal proteins in response to hypertonicity and muscle contraction. Proteomics data generated in this study can be explored through https://SpatialProteoDynamics.github.io .
PXD027747	34876572	Plasmin activity promotes amyloid deposition in a transgenic model of human transthyretin amyloidosis. 	Plasmin activity promotes amyloid deposition in a new transgenic model of human transthyretin amyloidosis.	amyloidosis, heart, tongue, transthyretin	Cardiac ATTR amyloidosis, a serious but much under-diagnosed form of cardiomyopathy, is caused by deposition of amyloid fibrils derived from the plasma protein transthyretin (TTR), but its pathogenesis is poorly understood and informative in vivo models have proved elusive. Here we report the generation of a mouse model of cardiac ATTR amyloidosis with transgenic expression of human TTR(S52P). The model is characterised by substantial ATTR amyloid deposits in the heart and tongue. The amyloid fibrils contain both full-length human TTR protomers and the residue 49-127 cleavage fragment which are present in ATTR amyloidosis patients. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasmin are abundant within the cardiac and lingual amyloid deposits, which contain marked serine protease activity; knockout of alpha2-antiplasmin, the physiological inhibitor of plasmin, enhances amyloid formation. Together, these findings indicate that cardiac ATTR amyloid deposition involves local uPA-mediated generation of plasmin and cleavage of TTR, consistent with the previously described mechano-enzymatic hypothesis for cardiac ATTR amyloid formation. This experimental model of ATTR cardiomyopathy has potential to allow further investigations of the factors that influence human ATTR amyloid deposition and the development of new treatments.
PXD022523	34876592	Delayed induction of type I and III interferons mediates nasal epithelial cell permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2. 	Delayed induction of type I and III interferons enhances nasal epithelial permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2	ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, nasal	The nasal epithelium is a plausible entry point for SARS-CoV-2, a site of pathogenesis and transmission, and may initiate the host response to SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral interferon (IFN) responses are critical to outcome of SARS-CoV-2. Yet little is known about the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and innate immunity in this tissue. Here we apply single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics to a primary cell model of human nasal epithelium differentiated at air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates widespread tropism for nasal epithelial cell types. The host response is dominated by type I and III IFNs and interferon-stimulated gene products. This response is notably delayed in onset relative to viral gene expression and compared to other respiratory viruses. Nevertheless, once established, the paracrine IFN response begins to impact on SARS-CoV-2 replication. When provided prior to infection, recombinant IFNbeta or IFNlambda1 induces an efficient antiviral state that potently restricts SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, preserving epithelial barrier integrity. These data imply that the IFN-I/III response to SARS-CoV-2 initiates in the nasal airway and suggest nasal delivery of recombinant IFNs to be a potential chemoprophylactic strategy.
PXD024889	34876683	Bolstering fitness via CO2 fixation and organic carbon uptake: mixotrophs in modern groundwater. 	Sulfur-fueled chemolithoautotrophs replenish organic carbon inventory in groundwater	Chemolithoautotrophy, Groundwater, Metagenomics, Metaproteomics, Raman microspectroscopy, Stable isotope probing	Current understanding of organic carbon inputs into ecosystems lacking photosynthetic primary production is predicated on data and inferences derived almost entirely from metagenomic analyses. The elevated abundances of putative chemolithoautotrophs in groundwaters suggest that dark CO2 fixation is an integral component of subsurface trophic webs. To understand the impact of autotrophically fixed carbon, the flux of CO2-derived carbon through various populations of subsurface microbiota must first be resolved, both quantitatively and temporally. Here we implement novel Stable Isotope Cluster Analysis to render a time-resolved and quantitative evaluation of (13)CO2-derived carbon flow through a groundwater community in microcosms stimulated with reduced sulfur compounds. We demonstrate that mixotrophs, not strict autotrophs, were the most abundant active organisms in groundwater microcosms. Species of Hydrogenophaga, Polaromonas, Dechloromonas, and other metabolically versatile mixotrophs drove the production and remineralization of organic carbon. Their activity facilitated the replacement of 43% and 80% of total microbial carbon stores in the groundwater microcosms with (13)C in just 21 and 70 days, respectively. The mixotrophs employed different strategies for satisfying their carbon requirements by balancing CO2 fixation and uptake of available organic compounds. These different strategies might provide fitness under nutrient-limited conditions, explaining the great abundances of mixotrophs in other oligotrophic habitats, such as the upper ocean and boreal lakes.
PXD026297	34878405	Assessing target engagement using proteome-wide solvent shift assays. 	Assessing target engagment using proteome-wide solvent shift assays	target enagagement	Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have enabled quantitative proteomics to become a powerful tool in the field of drug discovery, especially when applied toward proteome-wide target engagement studies. Similar to temperature gradients, increasing concentrations of organic solvents stimulate unfolding and precipitation of the cellular proteome. This property can be influenced by physical association with ligands and other molecules, making individual proteins more or less susceptible to solvent-induced denaturation. Herein, we report the development of proteome-wide solvent shift assays by combining the principles of solvent-induced precipitation (Zhang et al., 2020) with modern quantitative proteomics. Using this approach, we developed solvent proteome profiling (SPP), which is capable of establishing target engagement through analysis of SPP denaturation curves. We readily identified the specific targets of compounds with known mechanisms of action. As a further efficiency boost, we applied the concept of area under the curve analysis to develop solvent proteome integral solubility alteration (solvent-PISA) and demonstrate that this approach can serve as a reliable surrogate for SPP. We propose that by combining SPP with alternative methods, like thermal proteome profiling, it will be possible to increase the absolute number of high-quality melting curves that are attainable by either approach individually, thereby increasing the fraction of the proteome that can be screened for evidence of ligand binding.
PXD022074	34878723	Cytoskeletal protein degradation in brain death donor kidneys associates with adverse posttransplant outcomes. 	Brain death associated activation of Calpain-Talin axis in donor kidneys underlies podocyte matrix degradation and graft dysfunction in kidney transplantation	Kidney transplantation, allograft dysfunction, donation after brain death (DBD), kidney cytoskeleton, podocytes, protein degradation	In brain death, cerebral injury contributes to systemic biological dysregulation, causing significant cellular stress in donor kidneys adversely impacting the quality of grafts. Here, we hypothesized that donation after brain death (DBD) kidneys undergo proteolytic processes that may deem grafts susceptible to posttransplant dysfunction. Using mass spectrometry and immunoblotting, we mapped degradation profiles of cytoskeletal proteins in deceased and living donor kidney biopsies. We found that key cytoskeletal proteins in DBD kidneys were proteolytically cleaved, generating peptide fragments, predominantly in grafts with suboptimal posttransplant function. Interestingly, alpha-actinin-4 and talin-1 proteolytic fragments were detected in brain death but not in circulatory death or living donor kidneys with similar donor characteristics. As talin-1 is a specific proteolytic target of calpain-1, we investigated a potential trigger of calpain activation and talin-1 degradation using human ex vivo precision-cut kidney slices and in vitro podocytes. Notably, we showed that activation of calpain-1 by transforming growth factor-beta generated proteolytic fragments of talin-1 that matched the degradation fragments detected in DBD preimplantation kidneys, also causing dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton in human podocytes; events that were reversed by calpain-1 inhibition. Our data provide initial evidence that brain death donor kidneys are more susceptible to cytoskeletal protein degradation. Correlation to posttransplant outcomes may be established by future studies.
PXD028818	34878758	How the Presence of Hemin Affects the Expression of the Different Iron Uptake Pathways in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cells. 	How the presence of hemin affects the expression of all iron-uptake pathways in Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells	Iron uptake pathway, Pseudomonas, hemin	Iron is an essential nutriment for almost all organisms, but this metal is poorly bioavailable. During infection, bacteria access iron from the host by importing either iron or heme. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram-negative pathogen, secretes two siderophores, pyoverdine (PVD) and pyochelin (PCH), to access iron and is also able to use many siderophores produced by other microorganisms (called xenosiderophores). To access heme, P. aeruginosa uses three distinct uptake pathways, named Has, Phu, and Hxu. We previously showed that P. aeruginosa expresses the Has and Phu heme uptake systems and the PVD- and PCH-dependent iron uptake pathways in iron-restricted growth conditions, using proteomic and RT-qPCR approaches. Here, using the same approaches, we show that physiological concentrations of hemin in the bacterial growth medium result in the repression of the expression of the proteins of the PVD- and PCH-dependent iron uptake pathways, leading to less production of these two siderophores. This indicates that the pathogen adapts its phenotype to use hemin as an iron source rather than produce PVD and PCH to access iron. Moreover, the presence of both hemin and a xenosiderophore resulted in (i) the strong induction of the expression of the proteins of the added xenosiderophore uptake pathway, (ii) repression of the PVD- and PCH-dependent iron uptake pathways, and (iii) no effect on the expression levels of the Has, Phu, or Hxu systems, indicating that bacteria use both xenosiderophores and heme to access iron.
PXD028627	34878788	Next-Generation Serology by Mass Spectrometry: Readout of the SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Repertoire. 	Next-generation Serology by Mass Spectrometry:Readout of the SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Repertoire	Full MS scan, Glycan	Methods of antibody detection are used to assess exposure or immunity to a pathogen. Here, we present Ig-MS, a novel serological readout that captures the immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire at molecular resolution, including entire variable regions in Ig light and heavy chains. Ig-MS uses recent advances in protein mass spectrometry (MS) for multiparametric readout of antibodies, with new metrics like Ion Titer (IT) and Degree of Clonality (DoC) capturing the heterogeneity and relative abundance of individual clones without sequencing of B cells. We applied Ig-MS to plasma from subjects with severe and mild COVID-19 and immunized subjects after two vaccine doses, using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as the bait for antibody capture. Importantly, we report a new data type for human serology, that could use other antigens of interest to gauge immune responses to vaccination, pathogens, or autoimmune disorders.
PXD025781	34878824	LSD1-directed therapy affects glioblastoma tumorigenicity by deregulating the protective ATF4-dependent integrated stress response. 	LSD1-directed therapy affects glioblastoma tumorigenicity by deregulating the protective ATF4-dependent integrated stress response	LSD1, histone post-translational modifications	Glioblastoma (GBM) is a fatal tumor whose aggressiveness, heterogeneity, poor blood-brain barrier penetration, and resistance to therapy highlight the need for new targets and clinical treatments. A step toward clinical translation includes the eradication of GBM tumor-initiating cells (TICs), responsible for GBM heterogeneity and relapse. By using patient-derived TICs and xenograft orthotopic models, we demonstrated that the selective lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 inhibitor DDP_38003 (LSD1i) is able to penetrate the brain parenchyma in vivo in preclinical models, is well tolerated, and exerts antitumor activity in molecularly different GBMs. LSD1 genetic targeting further strengthens the role of LSD1 in GBM TIC maintenance. GBM TIC plasticity supports their adaptation and survival under a plethora of environmental stresses, including nutrient deficiency and proteostasis perturbation. By mimicking these stresses in vitro, we found that LSD1 inhibition hampers the induction of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), the master regulator of the integrated stress response (ISR). The resulting aberrant ISR sensitizes GBM TICs to stress-induced cell death, hampering tumor aggressiveness. Functionally, LSD1i interferes with LSD1 scaffolding function and prevents its interaction with CREBBP, a critical ATF4 activator. By disrupting the interaction between CREBBP and LSD1-ATF4 axis, LSD1 inhibition prevents GBM TICs from overcoming stress and sustaining GBM progression. The effectiveness of the LSD1 inhibition in preclinical models shown here places a strong rationale toward its clinical translation for GBM treatment.
PXD029335	34880217	GPR180 is a component of TGFbeta signalling that promotes thermogenic adipocyte function and mediates the metabolic effects of the adipocyte-secreted factor CTHRC1. 	hMADS cells secretome identification LC/MS/MS	human adipocytes, secreted proteins	Activation of thermogenic brown and beige adipocytes is considered as a strategy to improve metabolic control. Here, we identify GPR180 as a receptor regulating brown and beige adipocyte function and whole-body glucose homeostasis, whose expression in humans is associated with improved metabolic control. We demonstrate that GPR180 is not a GPCR but a component of the TGFbeta signalling pathway and regulates the activity of the TGFbeta receptor complex through SMAD3 phosphorylation. In addition, using genetic and pharmacological tools, we provide evidence that GPR180 is required to manifest Collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (CTHRC1) action to regulate brown and beige adipocyte activity and glucose homeostasis. In this work, we show that CTHRC1/GPR180 signalling integrates into the TGFbeta signalling as an alternative axis to fine-tune and achieve low-grade activation of the pathway to prevent pathophysiological response while contributing to control of glucose and energy metabolism.
PXD025582	34880286	Quantitative proteomic screen identifies annexin A2 as a host target for Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 effectors SopD2 and PipB2. 	Quantitative proteomic screen identifies Annexin A2 as a host target for Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 effectors SopD2 and PipB2	SILAC, Salmonella	Intracellular pathogens need to establish an intracellular replicative niche to promote survival and replication within the hostile environment inside the host cell. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) initiates formation of the unique Salmonella-containing vacuole and an extensive network of Salmonella-induced tubules in order to survive and thrive within host cells. At least six effectors secreted by the type III secretion system encoded within Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 (SPI-2), namely SifA, SopD2, PipB2, SteA, SseJ, and SseF, purportedly manipulate host cell intracellular trafficking and establish the intracellular replicative niche for S. Typhimurium. The phenotypes of these effectors are both subtle and complex, complicating elucidation of the mechanism underpinning host cell manipulation by S. Typhimurium. In this work we used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and a S. Typhimurium mutant that secretes increased amounts of effectors to identify cognate effector binding partners during infection. Using this method, we identified the host protein annexin A2 (AnxA2) as a binding partner for both SopD2 and PipB2 and were able to confirm its binding to SopD2 and PipB2 by reciprocal pull down, although there was a low level of non-specific binding of SopD2-2HA and PipB2-2HA to the Ni-Sepharose beads present. We further showed that knockdown of AnxA2 altered the intracellular positioning of the Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV). This suggests that AnxA2 plays a role in the subcellular positioning of the SCV which could potentially be mediated through protein-protein interactions with either SopD2 or PipB2. This demonstrates the value of studying effector interactions using proteomic techniques and natural effector delivery during infection rather than transfection.
PXD023993	34880314	A proteomics study identifying interactors of the FSHD2 gene product SMCHD1 reveals RUVBL1-dependent DUX4 repression. 	A proteomics study identifying interactors of the FSHD2 gene product SMCHD1 reveals RUVBL1-dependent DUX4 repression.	EZHIP, FSHD, RUVBL1, SILAC, SMCHD1	Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes Hinge Domain Containing 1 (SMCHD1) is a chromatin repressor, which is mutated in > 95% of Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) type 2 cases. In FSHD2, SMCHD1 mutations ultimately result in the presence of the cleavage stage transcription factor DUX4 in muscle cells due to a failure in epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat on chromosome 4q, which contains the DUX4 locus. While binding of SMCHD1 to D4Z4 and its necessity to maintain a repressive D4Z4 chromatin structure in somatic cells are well documented, it is unclear how SMCHD1 is recruited to D4Z4, and how it exerts its repressive properties on chromatin. Here, we employ a quantitative proteomics approach to identify and characterize novel SMCHD1 interacting proteins, and assess their functionality in D4Z4 repression. We identify 28 robust SMCHD1 nuclear interactors, of which 12 are present in D4Z4 chromatin of myocytes. We demonstrate that loss of one of these SMCHD1 interacting proteins, RuvB-like 1 (RUVBL1), further derepresses DUX4 in FSHD myocytes. We also confirm the interaction of SMCHD1 with EZH inhibitory protein (EZHIP), a protein which prevents global H3K27me3 deposition by the Polycomb repressive complex PRC2, providing novel insights into the potential function of SMCHD1 in the repression of DUX4 in the early stages of embryogenesis. The SMCHD1 interactome outlined herein can thus provide further direction into research on the potential function of SMCHD1 at genomic loci where SMCHD1 is known to act, such as D4Z4 repeats, the inactive X chromosome, autosomal gene clusters, imprinted loci and telomeres.
PXD028313	34880419	Huntingtin structure is orchestrated by HAP40 and shows a polyglutamine expansion-specific interaction with exon 1. 	HAP40 orchestrates huntingtin structure for differential interaction with polyglutamine expanded exon 1	Cryo-EM, Huntingtin, ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, SAXS, XL-MS, integrative modeling	Huntington's disease results from expansion of a glutamine-coding CAG tract in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, producing an aberrantly functioning form of HTT. Both wildtype and disease-state HTT form a hetero-dimer with HAP40 of unknown functional relevance. We demonstrate in vivo and in cell models that HTT and HAP40 cellular abundance are coupled. Integrating data from a 2.6 Aa cryo-electron microscopy structure, cross-linking mass spectrometry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and modeling, we provide a near-atomic-level view of HTT, its molecular interaction surfaces and compacted domain architecture, orchestrated by HAP40. Native mass spectrometry reveals a remarkably stable hetero-dimer, potentially explaining the cellular inter-dependence of HTT and HAP40. The exon 1 region of HTT is dynamic but shows greater conformational variety in the polyglutamine expanded mutant than wildtype exon 1. Our data provide a foundation for future functional and drug discovery studies targeting Huntington's disease and illuminate the structural consequences of HTT polyglutamine expansion.
PXD027406	34880498	Exercise plasma boosts memory and dampens brain inflammation via clusterin. 	Exercise plasma boosts memory and dampens brain inflammation via clusterin	plasma	Physical exercise is generally beneficial to all aspects of human and animal health, slowing cognitive ageing and neurodegeneration(1). The cognitive benefits of physical exercise are tied to an increased plasticity and reduced inflammation within the hippocampus(2-4), yet little is known about the factors and mechanisms that mediate these effects. Here we show that 'runner plasma', collected from voluntarily running mice and infused into sedentary mice, reduces baseline neuroinflammatory gene expression and experimentally induced brain inflammation. Plasma proteomic analysis revealed a concerted increase in complement cascade inhibitors including clusterin (CLU). Intravenously injected CLU binds to brain endothelial cells and reduces neuroinflammatory gene expression in a mouse model of acute brain inflammation and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Patients with cognitive impairment who participated in structured exercise for 6 months had higher plasma levels of CLU. These findings demonstrate the existence of anti-inflammatory exercise factors that are transferrable, target the cerebrovasculature and benefit the brain, and are present in humans who engage in exercise.
PXD028817	34880777	INTS7-ABCD3 Interaction Stimulates the Proliferation and Osteoblastic Differentiation of Mouse Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Suppressing Oxidative Stress. 	Integrator complex subunit 7 (INTS7) immunocoprecipitation (IP) LC-MS/MS	INTS7, IP	Increased adipocyte and decreased osteoblast differentiation, combined with the ectopic proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), represent the primary causes of osteoporosis. The dysregulation of numerous intracellular bioactive factors is responsible for the aberrant differentiation and growth of BM-MSCs. In this study, we focused on a new stimulative factor, integrator complex subunit 7 (INTS7), and its cooperative protein ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 3 (ABCD3)/high-density lipoprotein-binding protein (HDLBP) in mouse BM-MSCs. We aimed to uncover the effects of the INTS7-ABCD3/HDLBP interaction on BM-MSC biological behaviors and the potential mechanism underlying these effects. Functional in vitro experiments showed that the suppression of the INTS7-ABCD3 interaction rather than HDLBP could impair BM-MSC proliferation and induce cell apoptosis. Moreover, Alizarin Red S and Oil Red O staining, respectively, revealed that INTS7 and ABCD3 knockdown but not HDLBP knockdown could decrease osteoblastic differentiation and accelerate the adipogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs. Mechanistically, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and histone gamma-H2AX quantities significantly increased, whereas the levels of antioxidants declined due to INTS7 and ABCD3 inhibition in BM-MSCs. These findings indicated that the suppression of oxidative stress could be involved in the INTS7/ABCD3 co-regulatory mechanisms for BM-MSC proliferation and differentiation, identifying new potential candidates for osteoporosis therapy.

Among them is a unique class of lipid-derived electrophiles - isoketals that exhibit high chemical reactivity and critical biological functions. However, their target selectivity and profiles in complex proteomes remain unknown. Here we report a Paal-Knorr agent, 4-oxonon-8-ynal (herein termed ONAyne), for surveying the reactivity and selectivity of the gamma-dicarbonyl warhead in biological systems. Using an unbiased open-search strategy, we demonstrated the lysine specificity of ONAyne on a proteome-wide scale and characterized six probe-derived modifications, including the initial pyrrole adduct and its oxidative products (i.e., lactam and hydroxylactam adducts), an enlactam adduct from dehydration of hydroxylactam, and two chemotypes formed in the presence of endogenous formaldehyde (i.e., fulvene and aldehyde adducts). Furthermore, combined with quantitative chemoproteomics in a competitive format, ONAyne permitted global, in situ, and site-specific profiling of targeted lysine residues of two specific isomers of isoketals, levuglandin (LG) D2 and E2. The functional analyses reveal that LG-derived adduction drives inhibition of malate dehydrogenase MDH2 and exhibits a crosstalk with two epigenetic marks on histone H2B in macrophages. Our approach should be broadly useful for target profiling of bioactive gamma-dicarbonyls in diverse biological contexts.
PXD026782	34881176	Serpinc1 Acts as a Tumor Suppressor in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Through Inducing Apoptosis and Blocking Macrophage Polarization in an Ubiquitin-Proteasome Manner. 	Serpinc1 acts as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma through inducing apoptosis and blocking macrophage polarization in an ubiquitin-proteasome manner	apoptosis, liver cancer, macrophage, serpinc1, ubiquitination	Serpinc1 is a serine protease inhibitor in the coagulation cascade, but its role in tumor biology remains obscure. Here, we report an unexpected role of serpinc1 in suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In HCC patients, the mRNA and protein expression of serpinc1 is upregulated, which is negatively correlated with tumor grade, and has a better prognosis than patients with low serpinc1. In addition, patients with high expression of serpinc1 generally have a better tumor immune microenvironment, accompanied by changes in multiple immune cells and mediators. In particular, tumor-promoting M2 macrophages are negatively correlated with serpinc1 expression and the prognosis of HCC patients. In vitro experiments further show that overexpression of serpinc1 inhibits the growth of HCC cells (HepG2 and SMMC7721) by inducing apoptosis. Accordingly, cell co-culture experiments reveal the direct role of serpinc1-overexpressed HCC cells in inhibiting the formation of M2 macrophages. Subsequent unbiased quantitative proteomic and ubiquitinome analyses identify that multiple poly-ubiquitination of proteins involved in signal pathways (such as autophagy, apoptosis, lactate metabolism, and VEGF signaling) are regulated by serpinc1. Overall, these findings establish a serpinc1-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome system to control apoptosis and antitumor immunity.
PXD026037	34882395	Multiplexed Cross-Linking with Isobaric Quantitative Protein Interaction Reporter Technology. 	Multiplexed isobaric quantitative Protein Interaction Reporter (iqPIR) cross-linking on standard proteins	cross-linking mass spectrometry, multiplexed quantitation	Chemical cross-linking with mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has emerged as a useful technique for interrogating protein structures and interactions. When combined with quantitative proteomics strategies, protein conformational and interaction dynamics can be probed. Quantitative XL-MS has been demonstrated with the use of stable isotopes incorporated metabolically or into the cross-linker molecules. Isotope-labeled cross-linkers have primarily utilized deuterium and rely on MS1-based quantitation of precursor ion extracted ion chromatograms. Recently the development and application of isobaric quantitative protein interaction reporter (iqPIR) cross-linkers were reported, which utilize (13)C and (15)N isotope labels. Quantitation is accomplished using relative fragment ion isotope abundances in tandem mass spectra. Here we describe the synthesis and initial evaluation of a multiplexed set of iqPIR molecules, allowing for up to six cross-linked samples to be quantified simultaneously. To analyze data for such cross-linkers, the two-channel mode of iqPIR quantitative analysis was adapted to accommodate any number of channels with defined ion isotope peak mass offsets. The summed ion peak intensities in the overlapping channel isotope envelopes are apportioned among the channels to minimize the difference with respect to the predicted ion isotope envelopes. The result is accurate and reproducible relative quantitation enabling direct comparison among six differentially labeled cross-linked samples. The approach described here is generally extensible for the iqPIR strategy, accommodating future iqPIR reagent design, and enables large-scale in vivo quantitative XL-MS investigation of the interactome.
PXD029121	34884585	Proteomic Changes of Activated Hepatic Stellate Cells. 	Investigation of hepatic stellate cell proteomics during activa-tion with fetal bovine serum	Liver, activation, fibrosis, hepatic stellate cells	Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the major cellular drivers of liver fibrosis. Upon liver inflammation caused by a broad range of insults including non-alcoholic fatty liver, HSC transform from a quiescent into a proliferating, fibrotic phenotype. Although much is known about the pathophysiology of this process, exact cellular processes which occur in HSC and enable this transformation remain yet to be elucidated. In order to investigate this HSC transformation, we employed a simple, yet reliable model of HSC activation via an increase in growth medium serum concentration (serum activation). For that purpose, immortalized human LX-2 HSC were exposed to either 1% or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Resulting quiescent (1% FBS) and activated (10% FBS) LX-2 cells were then subjected to in-depth mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis as well as comprehensive phenotyping. Protein network analysis of activated LX-2 cells revealed an increase in the production of ribosomal proteins and proteins related to cell cycle control and migration, resulting in higher proliferation and faster migration phenotypes. Interestingly, we also observed a decrease in the expression of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis proteins in accordance with a concomitant loss of cytosolic lipid droplets during activation. Overall, this work provides an update on HSC activation characteristics using contemporary proteomic and bioinformatic analyses and presents an accessible model for HSC activation. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD029121.
PXD027486	34884768	Fetal Immunomodulatory Environment Following Cartilage Injury-The Key to CARTILAGE Regeneration? 	Fetal immunomodulatory environment following cartilage injury - the key to cartilage regeneration?	Cartilage, fetal, immunomodulation, inflammation, macrophage, neutrophil, regeneration	Fetal cartilage fully regenerates following injury, while in adult mammals cartilage injury leads to osteoarthritis (OA). Thus, in this study, we compared the in vivo injury response of fetal and adult ovine articular cartilage histologically and proteomically to identify key factors of fetal regeneration. In addition, we compared the secretome of fetal ovine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro with injured fetal cartilage to identify potential MSC-derived therapeutic factors. Cartilage injury caused massive cellular changes in the synovial membrane, with macrophages dominating the fetal, and neutrophils the adult, synovial cellular infiltrate. Correspondingly, proteomics revealed differential regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators and growth-factors between adult and fetal joints. Neutrophil-related proteins and acute phase proteins were the two major upregulated protein groups in adult compared to fetal cartilage following injury. In contrast, several immunomodulating proteins and growth factors were expressed significantly higher in the fetus than the adult. Comparison of the in vitro MSCs proteome with the in vivo fetal regenerative signature revealed shared upregulation of 17 proteins, suggesting their therapeutic potential. Biomimicry of the fetal paracrine signature to reprogram macrophages and modulate inflammation could be an important future research direction for developing novel therapeutics.
PXD027871	34884803	Investigation of the Proteomes of the Truffles Tuber albidum pico, T. aestivum, T. indicum, T. magnatum, and T. melanosporum. 	Differential bottom-up proteomics of truffles	DIA, LC-MS, Truffles	Truffles of the Tuber species are known as expensive foods, mainly for their distinct aroma and taste. This high price makes them a profitable target of food fraud, e.g., the misdeclaration of cheaper truffle species as expensive ones. While many studies investigated truffles on the metabolomic level or the volatile organic compounds extruded by them, research at the proteome level as a phenotype determining basis is limited. In this study, a bottom-up proteomic approach based on LC-MS/MS measurements in data-independent acquisition mode was performed to analyze the truffle species Tuber aestivum, Tuber albidum pico, Tuber indicum, Tuber magnatum, and Tuber melanosporum, and a protein atlas of the investigated species was obtained. The yielded proteomic fingerprints are unique for each of the of the five truffle species and can now be used in case of suspected food fraud. First, a comprehensive spectral library containing 9000 proteins and 50,000 peptides was generated by two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS). Then, samples of the truffle species were analyzed in data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics mode yielding 2715 quantified proteins present in all truffle samples. Individual species were clearly distinguishable by principal component analysis (PCA). Quantitative proteome fingerprints were generated from 2066 ANOVA significant proteins, and side-by-side comparisons of truffles were done by T-tests. A further aim of this study was the annotation of functions for the identified proteins. For Tuber magnatum and Tuber melanosporum conclusive links to their superior aroma were found by enrichment of proteins responsible for sulfur-metabolic processes in comparison with other truffles. The obtained data in this study may serve as a reference library for food analysis laboratories in the future to tackle food fraud by misdeclaration of truffles. Further identified proteins with their corresponding abundance values in the different truffle species may serve as potential protein markers in the establishment of targeted analysis methods. Lastly, the obtained data may serve in the future as a basis for deciphering the biochemistry of truffles more deeply as well, when protein databases of the different truffle species will be more complete.
PXD012005	34884833	Quantitative Proteomics and Differential Protein Abundance Analysis after the Depletion of PEX3 from Human Cells Identifies Additional Aspects of Protein Targeting to the ER. 	Polypeptide targeting to distinct areas of the human ER	HeLa, PEX3	Protein import into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the first step in the biogenesis of around 10,000 different soluble and membrane proteins in humans. It involves the co- or post-translational targeting of precursor polypeptides to the ER, and their subsequent membrane insertion or translocation. So far, three pathways for the ER targeting of precursor polypeptides and four pathways for the ER targeting of mRNAs have been described. Typically, these pathways deliver their substrates to the Sec61 polypeptide-conducting channel in the ER membrane. Next, the precursor polypeptides are inserted into the ER membrane or translocated into the ER lumen, which may involve auxiliary translocation components, such as the TRAP and Sec62/Sec63 complexes, or auxiliary membrane protein insertases, such as EMC and the TMCO1 complex. Recently, the PEX19/PEX3-dependent pathway, which has a well-known function in targeting and inserting various peroxisomal membrane proteins into pre-existent peroxisomal membranes, was also found to act in the targeting and, putatively, insertion of monotopic hairpin proteins into the ER. These either remain in the ER as resident ER membrane proteins, or are pinched off from the ER as components of new lipid droplets. Therefore, the question arose as to whether this pathway may play a more general role in ER protein targeting, i.e., whether it represents a fourth pathway for the ER targeting of precursor polypeptides. Thus, we addressed the client spectrum of the PEX19/PEX3-dependent pathway in both PEX3-depleted HeLa cells and PEX3-deficient Zellweger patient fibroblasts by an established approach which involved the label-free quantitative mass spectrometry of the total proteome of depleted or deficient cells, as well as differential protein abundance analysis. The negatively affected proteins included twelve peroxisomal proteins and two hairpin proteins of the ER, thus confirming two previously identified classes of putative PEX19/PEX3 clients in human cells. Interestingly, fourteen collagen-related proteins with signal peptides or N-terminal transmembrane helices belonging to the secretory pathway were also negatively affected by PEX3 deficiency, which may suggest compromised collagen biogenesis as a hitherto-unknown contributor to organ failures in the respective Zellweger patients.
PXD029795	34884877	The Secretome of Human Neonatal Mesenchymal Stem Cells Modulates Doxorubicin-Induced Cytotoxicity: Impact in Non-Tumor Cells. 	The Secretome of Human Neonatal Mesenchymal Stem Cells Modulates Doxorubicin-induced Cytotoxicity: Impact in Non-tumour Cells	3D cultures stem cell, cell culture, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, secretome	Doxorubicin (Dox) is one of the most widely used treatments for breast cancer, although limited by the well-documented cardiotoxicity and other off-target effects. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) secretome has shown immunomodulatory and regenerative properties, further potentiated under 3D conditions. This work aimed to uncover the effect of the MSC-derived secretome from 3D (CM3D) or 2D (CM2D) cultures, in human malignant breast cells (MDA-MB-231), non-tumor breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) and differentiated AC16 cardiomyocytes, co-treated with Dox. A comprehensive proteomic analysis of CM3D/CM2D was also performed to unravel the underlying mechanism. CM3D/CM2D co-incubation with Dox revealed no significant differences in MDA-MB-231 viability when compared to Dox alone, whereas MCF10A and AC16 viability was consistently improved in Dox+CM3D-treated cells. Moreover, neither CM2D nor CM3D affected Dox anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects in MDA-MB-231. Notably, Ge-LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis revealed that CM3D displayed protective features that might be linked to the regulation of cell proliferation (CAPN1, CST1, LAMC2, RANBP3), migration (CCN3, MMP8, PDCD5), invasion (TIMP1/2), oxidative stress (COX6B1, AIFM1, CD9, GSR) and inflammation (CCN3, ANXA5, CDH13, GDF15). Overall, CM3D decreased Dox-induced cytotoxicity in non-tumor cells, without compromising Dox chemotherapeutic profile in malignant cells, suggesting its potential use as a chemotherapy adjuvant to reduce off-target side effects.
PXD025935	34884899	Palm Oil-Rich Diet Affects Murine Liver Proteome and S-Palmitoylome. 	Palm oil-rich diet affects murine liver proteome and S-palmitoylome	S-palmitoylation, calfacilitin/TLCD1, high-fat diet, neutrophil degranulation, palm oil	Palmitic acid (C16:0) is the most abundant saturated fatty acid in animals serving as a substrate in synthesis and beta-oxidation of other lipids, and in the modification of proteins called palmitoylation. The influence of dietary palmitic acid on protein S-palmitoylation remains largely unknown. In this study we performed high-throughput proteomic analyses of a membrane-enriched fraction of murine liver to examine the influence of a palm oil-rich diet (HPD) on S-palmitoylation of proteins. HPD feeding for 4 weeks led to an accumulation of C16:0 and C18:1 fatty acids in livers which disappeared after 12-week feeding, in contrast to an accumulation of C16:0 in peritoneal macrophages. Parallel proteomic studies revealed that HPD feeding induced a sequence of changes of the level and/or S-palmitoylation of diverse liver proteins involved in fatty acid, cholesterol and amino acid metabolism, hemostasis, and neutrophil degranulation. The HPD diet did not lead to liver damage, however, it caused progressing obesity, hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia. We conclude that the relatively mild negative impact of such diet on liver functioning can be attributed to a lower bioavailability of palm oil-derived C16:0 vs. that of C18:1 and the efficiency of mechanisms preventing liver injury, possibly including dynamic protein S-palmitoylation.
PXD026279	34885041	Proteomic Signatures of Diffuse and Intestinal Subtypes of Gastric Cancer. 	Proteomic signatures of diffuse and intestinal subtypes of gastric cancer	diffuse gastric cancer, gastric cancer, intestinal gastric cancer, signet ring cell carcinoma	Gastric cancer is a leading cause of death from cancer globally. Gastric cancer is classified into intestinal, diffuse and indeterminate subtypes based on histology according to the Lauren classification. The intestinal and diffuse subtypes, although different in histology, demographics and outcomes, are still treated in the same fashion. This study was designed to discover proteomic signatures of diffuse and intestinal subtypes. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics using tandem mass tags (TMT)-based multiplexed analysis was used to identify proteins in tumor tissues from patients with diffuse or intestinal gastric cancer with adjacent normal tissue control. A total of 7448 or 4846 proteins were identified from intestinal or diffuse subtype, respectively. This quantitative mass spectrometric analysis defined a proteomic signature of differential expression across the two subtypes, which included gremlin1 (GREM1), bcl-2-associated athanogene 2 (BAG2), olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4), thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 6 (TRIP6) and melanoma-associated antigen 9 (MAGE-A9) proteins. Although GREM1, BAG2, OLFM4, TRIP6 and MAGE-A9 have all been previously implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, they have not been linked to intestinal or diffuse subtypes of gastric cancer. Using immunohistochemical labelling of a tissue microarray comprising of 124 cases of gastric cancer, we validated the proteomic signature obtained by mass spectrometry in the discovery cohort. Our findings should help investigate the pathogenesis of these gastric cancer subtypes and potentially lead to strategies for early diagnosis and treatment.
PXD029798	34885095	Changes in the Proteome in the Development of Chronic Human Papillomavirus Infection-A Prospective Study in HIV Positive and HIV Negative Rwandan Women. 	Proteome Changes in the Development of Chronic Human Papillomavirus Infection in Rwandan Women	HIV, HPV, Human papillomavirus, Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, TMTpro, tandem mass tags	BACKGROUND: Effects on the proteome when a high risk (HR)-HPV infection occurs, when it is cleared and when it becomes chronic were investigated. Moreover, biomarker panels that could identify cervical risk lesions were assessed. METHODS: Cytology, HPV screening and proteomics were performed on cervical samples from Rwandan HIV+ and HIV- women at baseline, at 9 months, at 18 months and at 24 months. Biological pathways were identified using the String database. RESULTS: The most significantly affected pathway when an incident HR-HPV infection occurred was neutrophil degranulation, and vesicle-mediated transport was the most significantly affected pathway when an HR-HPV infection was cleared; protein insertion into membrane in chronic HR-HPV lesions and in lesions where HR-HPVs were cleared were compared; and cellular catabolic process in high-grade lesions was compared to that in negative lesions. A four-biomarker panel (EIF1; BLOC1S5; LIMCH1; SGTA) was identified, which was able to distinguish chronic HR-HPV lesions from cleared HR-HPV/negative lesions (sensitivity 100% and specificity 91%). Another four-biomarker panel (ERH; IGKV2-30; TMEM97; DNAJA4) was identified, which was able to distinguish high-grade lesions from low-grade/negative lesions (sensitivity 100% and specificity 81%). CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the biological pathways triggered in HR-HPV infection, when HR-HPV becomes chronic and when cervical risk lesions develop. Moreover, we have identified potential biomarkers that may help to identify women with cervical risk lesions.
PXD028930	34885218	Deep Proteomic Analysis on Biobanked Paraffine-Archived Melanoma with Prognostic/Predictive Biomarker Read-Out. 	Proteomic Analysis on Paraffine-Archived Melanoma	ProteomeXchange project tag: CPTAC Consortium, immunotherapy targeted therapy responder, metastatic melanoma, outcome and survival by protein expression, prognostic and predictive biomarkers	The discovery of novel protein biomarkers in melanoma is crucial. Our introduction of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor protocol provides new opportunities to understand the progression of melanoma and open the possibility to screen thousands of FFPE samples deposited in tumor biobanks and available at hospital pathology departments. In our retrospective biobank pilot study, 90 FFPE samples from 77 patients were processed. Protein quantitation was performed by high-resolution mass spectrometry and validated by histopathologic analysis. The global protein expression formed six sample clusters. Proteins such as TRAF6 and ARMC10 were upregulated in clusters with enrichment for shorter survival, and proteins such as AIFI1 were upregulated in clusters with enrichment for longer survival. The cohort's heterogeneity was addressed by comparing primary and metastasis samples, as well comparing clinical stages. Within immunotherapy and targeted therapy subgroups, the upregulation of the VEGFA-VEGFR2 pathway, RNA splicing, increased activity of immune cells, extracellular matrix, and metabolic pathways were positively associated with patient outcome. To summarize, we were able to (i) link global protein expression profiles to survival, and they proved to be an independent prognostic indicator, as well as (ii) identify proteins that are potential predictors of a patient's response to immunotherapy and targeted therapy, suggesting new opportunities for precision medicine developments.
PXD029289	34885884	Mass Spectrometric Identification of Antimicrobial Peptides from Medicinal Seeds. 	Mass spectrometric identification of antimicrobial peptides from medicinal seeds	Antimicrobial peptides, Cysteine-rich peptides, Linum usitatissimum, Sesamum indicum, Trifolium pretense, flax, red clover, sesame	Traditional medicinal plants contain a variety of bioactive natural products including cysteine-rich (Cys-rich) antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Cys-rich AMPs are often crosslinked by multiple disulfide bonds which increase their resistance to chemical and enzymatic degradation. However, this class of molecules is relatively underexplored. Herein, in silico analysis predicted 80-100 Cys-rich AMPs per species from three edible traditional medicinal plants: Linum usitatissimum (flax), Trifolium pratense (red clover), and Sesamum indicum (sesame). Bottom-up proteomic analysis of seed peptide extracts revealed direct evidence for the translation of 3-10 Cys-rich AMPs per species, including lipid transfer proteins, defensins, alpha-hairpinins, and snakins. Negative activity revealed by antibacterial screening highlights the importance of employing a multi-pronged approach for AMP discovery. Further, this study demonstrates that flax, red clover, and sesame are promising sources for further AMP discovery and characterization.
PXD024708	34887394	How to build a ribosome from RNA fragments in Chlamydomonas mitochondria. 	How to make a ribosome from mixed-up ribosomal RNA fragments in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mitochondria	Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, cryo-EM, cryo-ET, fragmented ribosomal RNAs, mitochondria, mitochondrial ribosome, mitoribosome	Mitochondria are the powerhouse of eukaryotic cells. They possess their own gene expression machineries where highly divergent and specialized ribosomes, named hereafter mitoribosomes, translate the few essential messenger RNAs still encoded by mitochondrial genomes. Here, we present a biochemical and structural characterization of the mitoribosome in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, as well as a functional study of some of its specific components. Single particle cryo-electron microscopy resolves how the Chlamydomonas mitoribosome is assembled from 13 rRNA fragments encoded by separate non-contiguous gene pieces. Additional proteins, mainly OPR, PPR and mTERF helical repeat proteins, are found in Chlamydomonas mitoribosome, revealing the structure of an OPR protein in complex with its RNA binding partner. Targeted amiRNA silencing indicates that these ribosomal proteins are required for mitoribosome integrity. Finally, we use cryo-electron tomography to show that Chlamydomonas mitoribosomes are attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane via two contact points mediated by Chlamydomonas-specific proteins. Our study expands our understanding of mitoribosome diversity and the various strategies these specialized molecular machines adopt for membrane tethering.
PXD027237	34887419	RNF219 attenuates global mRNA decay through inhibition of CCR4-NOT complex-mediated deadenylation. 	Identification of acetylation-regulated interactors of the human CCR4-NOT complex	CCR4-NOT complex, E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF219, deadenylation, mRNA turnover, protein acetylation	The CCR4-NOT complex acts as a central player in the control of mRNA turnover and mediates accelerated mRNA degradation upon HDAC inhibition. Here, we explored acetylation-induced changes in the composition of the CCR4-NOT complex by purification of the endogenously tagged scaffold subunit NOT1 and identified RNF219 as an acetylation-regulated cofactor. We demonstrate that RNF219 is an active RING-type E3 ligase which stably associates with CCR4-NOT via NOT9 through a short linear motif (SLiM) embedded within the C-terminal low-complexity region of RNF219. By using a reconstituted six-subunit human CCR4-NOT complex, we demonstrate that RNF219 inhibits deadenylation through the direct interaction of the alpha-helical SLiM with the NOT9 module. Transcriptome-wide mRNA half-life measurements reveal that RNF219 attenuates global mRNA turnover in cells, with differential requirement of its RING domain. Our results establish RNF219 as an inhibitor of CCR4-NOT-mediated deadenylation, whose loss upon HDAC inhibition contributes to accelerated mRNA turnover.
PXD029919	34887871	HOTAIR Up-Regulation Activates NF-kappaB to Induce Immunoescape in Gliomas. 	HOTAIR knockdown glioma cell proteomics	HOTAIR, glioma, lncRNA	Background: Checkpoint blockade therapies targeting programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its receptor programmed cell death 1 promote T cell-mediated immune surveillance against tumors and have been associated with significant clinical benefit in cancer patients. The long-stranded non-coding RNA HOTAIR is highly expressed and associated with metastasis in a variety of cancer types and promotes tumor metastasis at least in part through association with the PRC2 complex that induces redirection to hundreds of genes involved in tumor metastasis. Here, we report that HOTAIR is an activator lncRNA of the NF-kappaB pathway and demonstrate that its apparent upregulation promotes inflammatory signaling and immune escape in glioma cells. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis was used to elucidate the relationship between HOTAIR and NF-kappaB pathway in HOTAIR knockdown glioma cells. At the cytological level, protein hybridization and immunofluorescence were used to detect the response of proteins in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway to HOTAIR regulation. ChIP and ChIRP experiments identified HOTAIR target genes. Animal experiments verified alterations in inflammation and immune escape following HOTAIR knockdown and activity inhibition. Results: HOTAIR activated the expression of proteins involved in NF-kappaB, TNFalpha, MAPK and other inflammatory signaling pathways. In addition, HOTAIR induced various proteins containing protein kinase structural domains and promoted the enrichment of proteins and complexes of important inflammatory signaling pathways, such as the TNFalpha/NF-kappaB signaling protein complex, the IkappaB kinase complex, and the IKKA-IKKB complex. In addition, HOTAIR aberrantly activated biological processes involved in glioma immune responses, T-cell co-stimulation and transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. HOTAIR facilitated the induction of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation by suppressing the expression of the NF-kappaB upstream protein UBXN1, promoting NF-kappaB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. In vivo, reduction of HOTAIR decreased PD-L1 protein expression, indicating that cells are more likely to be targeted by immune T cells. Conclusion: In conclusion, our results provide convincing evidence that lncRNA HOTAIR drives aberrant gene transcription and immune escape from tumor cells through the NF-kappaB pathway.
PXD026390	34887881	Differential Protein Expression Analysis of Two Sugarcane Varieties in Response to Diazotrophic Plant Growth-Promoting Endophyte Enterobacter roggenkampii ED5. 	TMT Quantitative Proteomics Analyzed of E .roggenkampii ED5 and Sugarcane Interaction	E .roggenkampii ED5, TMT, sugarcane	Plant endophytic bacteria have many vital roles in plant growth promotion (PGP), such as nitrogen (N) fixation and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, the seedlings of sugarcane varieties B8 (requires a low concentration of nitrogen for growth) and GT11 (requires a high concentration of nitrogen for growth) were inoculated with endophytic diazotroph Enterobacter roggenkampii ED5, which exhibits multiple PGP traits, isolated from sugarcane roots. The results showed that the inoculation with E. roggenkampii ED5 promoted the growth of plant significantly in both sugarcane varieties. (15)N detection at 60 days post-inoculation proved that the inoculation with strain ED5 increased the total nitrogen concentration in the leaf and root than control in both sugarcane varieties, which was higher in B8. Biochemical parameters and phytohormones in leaf were analyzed at 30 and 60 days after the inoculation. The results showed that the inoculation with E. roggenkampii ED5 improved the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), NADH-glutamate dehydrogenase (NADH-GDH), glutamine synthetase (GS), and endo-beta-1,4-glucanase, and the contents of proline and indole acetic acid (IAA) in leaf, and it was generally more significant in B8 than in GT11. Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) labeling and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used to perform comparative proteomic analysis in the sugarcane leaves at 30 days after inoculation with strain ED5. A total of 27,508 proteins were detected, and 378 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found in the treated sugarcane variety B8 (BE) as compared to control (BC), of which 244 were upregulated and 134 were downregulated. In contrast, a total of 177 DEPs were identified in the treated sugarcane variety GT11 (GE) as compared to control (GC), of which 103 were upregulated and 74 were downregulated. The DEPs were associated with nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis, starch, sucrose metabolism, response to oxidative stress, hydrolase activity, oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione metabolism, phenylpropanoid metabolic process, and response to stresses in Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proteomic approach to investigate the molecular basis of the interaction between N-fixing endophytic strain E. roggenkampii ED5 and sugarcane.
PXD028225	34888242	High Serpin Family A Member 10 Expression Confers Platinum Sensitivity and Is Associated With Survival Benefit in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer: Based on Quantitative Proteomic Analysis. 	Proteomic analysis of tumor tissues form high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients	Proteomic analysis, ovarian cancer, platinum resistant, platinum sensitive	This study aims to identify differentially expressed proteins related with platinum sensitivity and to find biomarkers for predicting platinum response and survival outcomes in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Eligible HGSOC patients were divided into platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant groups according to platinum-free interval (PFI). Tissue protein lysates from tumor tissues were subjected to an in-solution tryptic digest followed by tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling of the resulting peptides and mass spectrometric analysis. Candidate proteins were identified using differentially expressed protein and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and their survival relevance was evaluated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer cohort. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the protein expression profiling between the two patient groups. In the GSEA model, a gene set of 239 extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins was significantly enriched in the platinum-sensitive group [normalized enrichment score (NES) = 3.82, q < 10(-5)], and this finding was confirmed in TCGA ovarian cancer cohort. Interestingly, an ECM-related gene expression, serpin family A member 10 (SERPINA10), was identified to be significantly positively correlated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in TCGA ovarian cancer cohort (all p < 0.05). IHC results demonstrated that HGSOC patients with high SERPINA10 expression had longer PFI than the patients with low SERPINA10 expression (9 vs. 5 months, p = 0.038), and the SERPINA10 expression had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.758 (95% CI = 0.612-0.905; p = 0.005) to discriminate the platinum-sensitive group from the platinum-resistant group. In conclusion, the results suggested that SERPINA10 could be a promising biomarker for predicting the response and survival in platinum-based chemotherapy of HGSOC.
PXD025645	34888943	Alterations in sphingolipid composition and mitochondrial bioenergetics represent synergistic therapeutic vulnerabilities linked to multidrug resistance in leukemia. 	Vincristine resistance reshapes sphingolipid composition and promotes mitochondrial complex I deficiency in acute myelogenous leukemia    	AML, Vincristine, drug resistance, mitochondria, sphingolipids	Modifications in sphingolipid (SL) metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics are key factors implicated in cancer cell response to chemotherapy, including chemotherapy resistance. In the present work, we utilized acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, selected to be refractory to various chemotherapeutics, to explore the interplay between SL metabolism and mitochondrial biology supportive of multidrug resistance (MDR). In agreement with previous findings in cytarabine or daunorubicin resistant AML cells, relative to chemosensitive wildtype controls, HL-60 cells refractory to vincristine (HL60/VCR) presented with alterations in SL enzyme expression and lipidome composition. Such changes were typified by upregulated expression of various ceramide detoxifying enzymes, as well as corresponding shifts in ceramide, glucosylceramide, and sphingomyelin (SM) molecular species. With respect to mitochondria, despite consistent increases in both basal respiration and maximal respiratory capacity, direct interrogation of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system revealed intrinsic deficiencies in HL60/VCR, as well as across multiple MDR model systems. Based on the apparent requirement for augmented SL and mitochondrial flux to support the MDR phenotype, we explored a combinatorial therapeutic paradigm designed to target each pathway. Remarkably, despite minimal cytotoxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), co-targeting SL metabolism, and respiratory complex I (CI) induced synergistic cytotoxicity consistently across multiple MDR leukemia models. Together, these data underscore the intimate connection between cellular sphingolipids and mitochondrial metabolism and suggest that pharmacological intervention across both pathways may represent a novel treatment strategy against MDR.
PXD028692	34890644	African swine fever virus cysteine protease pS273R inhibits pyroptosis by noncanonically cleaving gasdermin D. 	Identification of African Swine Fever Virus pS273R (ASFV pS273R) interacting proteins in the cell lysates prepared from the Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) cells by immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry analysis	His-pS273R IP mass spectrometry	African swine fever (ASF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease that affects domestic pigs and wild boar and is caused by the African swine fever virus (ASFV). The ASFV virion contains a long double-stranded DNA genome, which encodes more than 150 proteins. However, the immune escape mechanism and pathogenesis of ASFV remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the pyroptosis execution protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a new binding partner of ASFV-encoded protein S273R (pS273R), which belongs to the SUMO-1 cysteine protease family. Further experiments demonstrated that ASFV pS273R-cleaved swine GSDMD in a manner dependent on its protease activity. ASFV pS273R specifically cleaved GSDMD at G107-A108 to produce a shorter N-terminal fragment of GSDMD consisting of residues 1 to 107 (GSDMD-N1-107). Interestingly, unlike the effect of GSDMD-N1-279 fragment produced by caspase-1-mediated cleavage, the assay of LDH release, cell viability, and virus replication showed that GSDMD-N1-107 did not trigger pyroptosis or inhibit ASFV replication. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism involved in the inhibition of ASFV infection-induced pyroptosis, which highlights an important function of pS273R in inflammatory responses and ASFV replication.
PXD029656	34893599	The short isoform of the host antiviral protein ZAP acts as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. 	The short isoform of the host antiviral protein ZAP acts as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting	Covid-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, SARS-CoV-2, frameshifting, translation regulation	Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a fundamental gene expression event in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It allows production of essential viral, structural and replicative enzymes that are encoded in an alternative reading frame. Despite the importance of PRF for the viral life cycle, it is still largely unknown how and to what extent cellular factors alter mechanical properties of frameshift elements and thereby impact virulence. This prompted us to comprehensively dissect the interplay between the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift element and the host proteome. We reveal that the short isoform of the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP-S) is a direct regulator of PRF in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. ZAP-S overexpression strongly impairs frameshifting and inhibits viral replication. Using in vitro ensemble and single-molecule techniques, we further demonstrate that ZAP-S directly interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and interferes with the folding of the frameshift RNA element. Together, these data identify ZAP-S as a host-encoded inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting and expand our understanding of RNA-based gene regulation.
PXD029217	34893620	Dynamic regulation of N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m(6)Am) in obesity. 	Proteomics of liver from ob/ob and WT mice	liver, ob/ob	The prevalent m(6)Am mRNA cap modification was recently identified as a valid target for removal by the human obesity gene FTO along with the previously established m(6)A mRNA modification. However, the deposition and dynamics of m(6)Am in regulating obesity are unknown. Here, we investigate the liver m(6)A/m methylomes in mice fed on a high fat Western-diet and in ob/ob mice. We find that FTO levels are elevated in fat mice, and that genes which lost m(6)Am marking under obesity are overly downregulated, including the two fatty-acid-binding proteins FABP2, and FABP5. Furthermore, the cellular perturbation of FTO correspondingly affect protein levels of its targets. Notably, generally m(6)Am- but not m(6)A-methylated genes, are found to be highly enriched in metabolic processes. Finally, we deplete all m(6)A background via Mettl3 knockout, and unequivocally uncover the association of m(6)Am methylation with increased mRNA stability, translation efficiency, and higher protein expression. Together, these results strongly implicate a dynamic role for m(6)Am in obesity-related translation regulation.
PXD026382	34897998	BoxCar and shotgun proteomic analyses reveal molecular networks regulated by UBR5 in prostate cancer. 	BoxCar and Shotgun Proteomic Analyses Reveal Molecular Networks Regulated by UBR5 in Prostate Cancer	BoxCar, FANCD2, UBR5, XRCC3, network, prostate cancer, shotgun	Prostate cancer (PC) is a major health and economic problem in industrialized countries, yet our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PC progression and drug response remains limited. Accumulating evidence showed that certain E3 ubiquitin ligases such as SIAH2, RNF7, and SPOP play important roles in PC development and progression. However, the roles and mechanisms of other E3s in PC progression remain largely unexplored. Through an integration analysis of clinical genomic and transcriptomic profiles of PC tumors, this study identified UBR5 as a top PC-relevant E3 ubiquitin ligase whose expression levels are strongly associated with PC progression and aggressiveness. BoxCar and shotgun proteomic analyses of control and UBR5-knockdown PC3 cells complementarily identified 75 UBR5-regulated proteins. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the 75 proteins form four molecular networks centered around FANCD2, PAF1, YY1, and LAMB3 via direct protein-protein interactions. Experimental analyses demonstrated that UBR5 associates with and downregulates two key DNA damage repair proteins (XRCC3 and FANCD2) and confers PC cell sensitivity to olaparib, a PARP inhibitor in clinical use for cancer therapy. This study represents the first application of BoxCar in PC research, provides new insights into the molecular functions of UBR5 in PC, and suggests that PC patients with UBR5-high tumors may potentially benefit from PARP inhibitor treatment.
PXD022012	34899632	Unraveling the Metabolic Requirements of the Gut Commensal Bacteroides ovatus. 	B. dentium intracellular proteins	B. dentium, Bacteria, microbiome	Background: Bacteroidetes are the most common bacterial phylum in the mammalian intestine and the effects of several Bacteroides spp. on multiple facets of host physiology have been previously described. Of the Bacteroides spp., Bacteroides ovatus has recently garnered attention due to its beneficial effects in the context of intestinal inflammation. In this study, we aimed to examine model host intestinal physiological conditions and dietary modifications to characterize their effects on B. ovatus growth. Methods and Results: Using Biolog phenotypic microarrays, we evaluated 62 primary carbon sources and determined that B. ovatus ATCC 8384 can use the following carbohydrates as primary carbon sources: 10 disaccharides, 4 trisaccharides, 4 polysaccharides, 4 polymers, 3 L-linked sugars, 6 D-linked sugars, 5 amino-sugars, 6 alcohol sugars, and 15 organic acids. Proteomic profiling of B. ovatus bacteria revealed that a significant portion of the B. ovatus proteome contains proteins important for metabolism. Among the proteins, we found glycosyl hydrolase (GH) familes GH2, GH5, GH20, GH 43, GH88, GH92, and GH95. We also identified multiple proteins with antioxidant properties and reasoned that these proteins may support B. ovatus growth in the GI tract. Upon further testing, we showed that B. ovatus grew robustly in various pH, osmolarity, bile, ethanol, and H2O2 concentrations; indicating that B. ovatus is a well-adapted gut microbe. Conclusion: Taken together, we have demonstrated that key host and diet-derived changes in the intestinal environment influence B. ovatus growth. These data provide the framework for future work toward understanding how diet and lifestyle interventions may promote a beneficial environment for B. ovatus growth.
PXD029651	34899851	Lysine Acetylation in the Proteome of Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells in Diabetic Nephropathy. 	mice Renal tubular epithelial cells LC-MS/MS	Renal tubular epithelial cells	Diabetic nephropathy is considered one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes and the pathophysiology involves multiple factors. Progressive diabetic nephropathy is believed to be related to the structure and function of the tubular epithelial cells in the kidney. However, the role of lysine acetylation in lesions of the renal tubular epithelial cells arising from hyperglycemia is poorly understood. Consequently, in this study, we cultured mouse renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro under high glucose conditions and analyzed the acetylation levels of proteins by liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. We identified 48 upregulated proteins and downregulated 86 proteins. In addition, we identified 113 sites with higher acetylation levels and 374 sites with lower acetylation levels. Subcellular localization analysis showed that the majority of the acetylated proteins were located in the mitochondria (43.17%), nucleus (28.57%) and cytoplasm (16.19%). Enrichment analysis indicated that these acetylated proteins are primarily associated with oxidative phosphorylation, the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), metabolic pathways and carbon metabolism. In addition, we used the MCODE plug-in and the cytoHubba plug-in in Cytoscape software to analyze the PPI network and displayed the first four most compact MOCDEs and the top 10 hub genes from the differentially expressed proteins between global and acetylated proteomes. Finally, we extracted 37 conserved motifs from 4915 acetylated peptides. Collectively, this comprehensive analysis of the proteome reveals novel insights into the role of lysine acetylation in tubular epithelial cells and may make a valuable contribution towards the identification of the pathological mechanisms of diabetic nephropathy.
PXD026332	34900012	Digestive Enzyme Activity and Protein Degradation in Plasma of Heart Failure Patients. 	Digestive Enzyme Activity and Protein Degradation in Plasma of Heart Failure Patients	Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), digestive enzymes, free peptides, heart failure	INTRODUCTION: Heart failure is associated with degradation of cell functions and extracellular matrix proteins, but the trigger mechanisms are uncertain. Our recent evidence shows that active digestive enzymes can leak out of the small intestine into the systemic circulation and cause cell dysfunctions and organ failure. METHODS: Accordingly, we investigated in morning fasting plasma of heart failure (HF) patients the presence of pancreatic trypsin, a major enzyme responsible for digestion. RESULTS: Western analysis shows that trypsin in plasma is significantly elevated in HF compared to matched controls and their concentrations correlate with the cardiac dysfunction biomarker BNP and inflammatory biomarkers CRP and TNF-alpha. The plasma trypsin levels in HF are accompanied by elevated pancreatic lipase concentrations. The trypsin has a significantly elevated activity as determined by substrate cleavage. Mass spectrometry shows that the number of plasma proteins in the HF patients is similar to controls while the number of peptides was increased about 20% in HF patients. The peptides are derived from extracellular and intracellular protein sources and exhibit cleavage sites by trypsin as well as other degrading proteases (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026332).ConnclusionsThese results provide the first evidence that active digestive enzymes leak into the systemic circulation and may participate in myocardial cell dysfunctions and tissue destruction in HF patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that active digestive enzymes leak into the systemic circulation and may participate in myocardial cell dysfunctions and tissue destruction in HF patients.

PXD029451	34901247	Proteome Analysis of Outer Membrane Vesicles From a Highly Virulent Strain of Haemophilus parasuis. 	Proteome analysis of outer membrane vesicles from a highly virulent strain of Haemophilus parasuis	Haemophilus parasuis, Outer membrane vesicles, Proteome analysis	Haemophilus parasuis has emerged as an important bacterial pathogen in pig husbandry, as H. parasuis can coinfect pigs with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms and further cause an aggravation of the disease. It is crucial to investigate its pathogenetic mechanism. Gram-negative bacteria naturally secrete outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), and their potent virulence factors play prominent roles that affect the interaction between bacteria and host. Still, the pathogenesis that is associated with the bacterial OMVs has not been well-elucidated. In this study, we investigated the secretion of OMVs from a clinical H. parasuis isolate strain (H45). In addition, we further analyzed the characterization, the comprehensive proteome, and the virulence potential of OMVs. Our data demonstrated that H. parasuis could secrete OMVs into the extracellular milieu during infection. Using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) identification and bio-information analysis, we identified 588 different proteins associated with OMVs. Also, we also analyzed the subcellular location and biological function of those proteins. These proteins are mainly involved in immune and iron metabolism. Moreover, we confirmed the pathogenicity of H. parasuis OMVs by observing a strong inflammatory response in J774A.1 and porcine alveolar macrophages. Taken together, our findings suggested that OMVs from H. parasuis were involved in the pathogenesis of this bacterium during infection.
PXD027036	34903058	Analogous Metabolic Decoupling in Pseudomonas putida and Comamonas testosteroni Implies Energetic Bypass to Facilitate Gluconeogenic Growth. 	 Gluconeogenic/Glycolytic growth in P. putida KT2440 and C. testosteroni Kf1	IPTL, bacteria, diDO-IPTL, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, metabolism, quantitative	Gluconeogenic carbon metabolism is not well understood, especially within the context of flux partitioning between energy generation and biomass production, despite the importance of gluconeogenic carbon substrates in natural and engineered carbon processing. Here, using multiple omics approaches, we elucidate the metabolic mechanisms that facilitate gluconeogenic fast-growth phenotypes in Pseudomonas putida and Comamonas testosteroni, two Proteobacteria species with distinct metabolic networks. In contrast to the genetic constraint of C. testosteroni, which lacks the enzymes required for both sugar uptake and a complete oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, sugar metabolism in P. putida is known to generate surplus NADPH by relying on the oxidative PP pathway within its characteristic cyclic connection between the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) and Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas (EMP) pathways. Remarkably, similar to the genome-based metabolic decoupling in C. testosteroni, our (13)C-fluxomics reveals an inactive oxidative PP pathway and disconnected EMP and ED pathways in P. putida during gluconeogenic feeding, thus requiring transhydrogenase reactions to supply NADPH for anabolism in both species by leveraging the high tricarboxylic acid cycle flux during gluconeogenic growth. Furthermore, metabolomics and proteomics analyses of both species during gluconeogenic feeding, relative to glycolytic feeding, demonstrate a 5-fold depletion in phosphorylated metabolites and the absence of or up to a 17-fold decrease in proteins of the PP and ED pathways. Such metabolic remodeling, which is reportedly lacking in Escherichia coli exhibiting a gluconeogenic slow-growth phenotype, may serve to minimize futile carbon cycling while favoring the gluconeogenic metabolic regime in relevant proteobacterial species. IMPORTANCE Glycolytic metabolism of sugars is extensively studied in the Proteobacteria, but gluconeogenic carbon sources (e.g., organic acids, amino acids, aromatics) that feed into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle are widely reported to produce a fast-growth phenotype, particularly in species with biotechnological relevance. Much remains unknown about the importance of glycolysis-associated pathways in the metabolism of gluconeogenic carbon substrates. Here, we demonstrate that two distinct proteobacterial species, through genetic constraints or metabolic regulation at specific metabolic nodes, bypass the oxidative PP pathway during gluconeogenic growth and avoid unnecessary carbon fluxes by depleting protein investment into connected glycolysis pathways. Both species can leverage instead the high TCA cycle flux during gluconeogenic feeding to meet NADPH demand. Importantly, lack of a complete oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is a widespread metabolic trait in Proteobacteria with a gluconeogenic carbon preference, thus highlighting the important relevance of our findings toward elucidating the metabolic architecture in these bacteria.
PXD023204	34903172	Proteome and secretome profiling of zinc availability in Cryptococcus neoformans identifies Wos2 as a subtle influencer of fungal virulence determinants. 	Zinc-associated proteome of Cryptococcus neoformans	Cryptococcus neoformans, fungal pathogenesis, polysaccharide capsule, quantitative proteomics, virulence, zinc limitation	BACKGROUND: Fungal infections impact over 25% of the global population. For the opportunistic fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, infection leads to cryptococcosis. In the presence of the host, disease is enabled by elaboration of sophisticated virulence determinants, including polysaccharide capsule, melanin, thermotolerance, and extracellular enzymes. Conversely, the host protects itself from fungal invasion by regulating and sequestering transition metals (e.g., iron, zinc, copper) important for microbial growth and survival. RESULTS: Here, we explore the intricate relationship between zinc availability and fungal virulence via mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics. We observe a core proteome along with a distinct zinc-regulated protein-level signature demonstrating a shift away from transport and ion binding under zinc-replete conditions towards transcription and metal acquisition under zinc-limited conditions. In addition, we revealed a novel connection among zinc availability, thermotolerance, as well as capsule and melanin production through the detection of a Wos2 ortholog in the secretome under replete conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we provide new biological insight into cellular remodeling at the protein level of C. neoformans under regulated zinc conditions and uncover a novel connection between zinc homeostasis and fungal virulence determinants.
PXD029362	34904638	Generation of ENSEMBL-based proteogenomics databases boosts the identification of non-canonical peptides. 	Generation of ENSEMBL-based proteogenomics databases boost the identification of novel peptides - Mouse dataset	Mice	SUMMARY: We have implemented the pypgatk package and the pgdb workflow to create proteogenomics databases based on ENSEMBL resources. The tools allow the generation of protein sequences from novel protein-coding transcripts by performing a three-frame translation of pseudogenes, lncRNAs and other non-canonical transcripts, such as those produced by alternative splicing events. It also includes exonic out-of-frame translation from otherwise canonical protein-coding mRNAs. Moreover, the tool enables the generation of variant protein sequences from multiple sources of genomic variants including COSMIC, cBioportal, gnomAD and mutations detected from sequencing of patient samples. pypgatk and pgdb provide multiple functionalities for database handling including optimized target/decoy generation by the algorithm DecoyPyrat. Finally, we have reanalyzed six public datasets in PRIDE by generating cell-type specific databases for 65 cell lines using the pypgatk and pgdb workflow, revealing a wealth of non-canonical or cryptic peptides amounting to >5% of the total number of peptides identified. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is freely available. pypgatk: https://github.com/bigbio/py-pgatk/ and pgdb: https://nf-co.re/pgdb.

PXD025875	34904663	Dynamic 23S rRNA modification ho5C2501 benefits Escherichia coli under oxidative stress. 	Dynamic 23S rRNA modification ho5C2501 benefits Escherichia coli under oxidative stress	Dps, E. coli, RNA modifications, RlhA, oxidative stress, ribosome	Post-transcriptional modifications are added to ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) to govern ribosome biogenesis and to fine-tune protein biosynthesis. In Escherichia coli and related bacteria, RlhA uniquely catalyzes formation of a 5-hydroxycytidine (ho5C) at position 2501 of 23S rRNA. However, the molecular and biological functions as well as the regulation of ho5C2501 modification remain unclear. We measured growth curves with the modification-deficient DeltarlhA strain and quantified the extent of the modification during different conditions by mass spectrometry and reverse transcription. The levels of ho5C2501 in E. coli ribosomes turned out to be highly dynamic and growth phase-dependent, with the most effective hydroxylation yields observed in the stationary phase. We demonstrated a direct effect of ho5C2501 on translation efficiencies in vitro and in vivo. High ho5C2501 levels reduced protein biosynthesis which however turned out to be beneficial for E. coli for adapting to oxidative stress. This functional advantage was small under optimal conditions or during heat or cold shock, but becomes pronounced in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Taken together, these data provided first functional insights into the role of this unique 23S rRNA modification for ribosome functions and bacterial growth under oxidative stress.
PXD008274	34906086	A novel strategy to uncover specific GO terms/phosphorylation pathways in phosphoproteomic data in Arabidopsis thaliana. 	Label free phosphoproteomic analysis of early phosphorylation events during deetiolation in Arabidopsis thaliana	Light, phosphoproteomics, photoreceptors	BACKGROUND: Proteins are the workforce of the cell and their phosphorylation status tailors specific responses efficiently. One of the main challenges of phosphoproteomic approaches is to deconvolute biological processes that specifically respond to an experimental query from a list of phosphoproteins. Comparison of the frequency distribution of GO (Gene Ontology) terms in a given phosphoproteome set with that observed in the genome reference set (GenRS) is the most widely used tool to infer biological significance. Yet, this comparison assumes that GO term distribution between the phosphoproteome and the genome are identical. However, this hypothesis has not been tested due to the lack of a comprehensive phosphoproteome database. RESULTS: In this study, we test this hypothesis by constructing three phosphoproteome databases in Arabidopsis thaliana: one based in experimental data (ExpRS), another based in in silico phosphorylation protein prediction (PredRS) and a third that is the union of both (UnRS). Our results show that the three phosphoproteome reference sets show default enrichment of several GO terms compared to GenRS, indicating that GO term distribution in the phosphoproteomes does not match that of the genome. Moreover, these differences overshadow the identification of GO terms that are specifically enriched in a particular condition. To overcome this limitation, we present an additional comparison of the sample of interest with UnRS to uncover GO terms specifically enriched in a particular phosphoproteome experiment. Using this strategy, we found that mRNA splicing and cytoplasmic microtubule compounds are important processes specifically enriched in the phosphoproteome of dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a novel strategy to uncover GO specific terms in phosphoproteome data of Arabidopsis that could be applied to any other organism. We also highlight the importance of specific phosphorylation pathways that take place during dark-grown Arabidopsis development.
PXD026552	34906616	Cryptic splicing events result in unexpected protein products from calpain-10 (CAPN10) cDNA. 	Proteomics for identification of CAPN10 targets	COS7cells, calpain 10, protease	Calpain-10 (CAPN10) belongs to the calpain superfamily. Genetic polymorphisms of the CAPN10 gene are associated with susceptibility to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although the role of CAPN10 in the pathophysiology of diabetes has been extensively investigated, its biochemical properties are largely unknown. In this report, we made the surprising discovery that CAPN10 cDNA transcripts are subject to cryptic splicing and unexpected protein products were expressed. The same set of splicing products was reproducibly detected in four types of cultured cells including the primary culture of mouse myoblast. At least, one of the products was identical to a natural splicing variant. Sequence analysis of the splicing potential of CAPN10 cDNA, together with mutagenesis studies, resulted in the identification of a powerful splicing acceptor site at the junction of the sequences encoded by exons 9 and 10. We successfully extended the analysis to create expression construct resistant to splicing for both human and mouse CAPN10. The construct allowed us to analyze two major CAPN10 isoforms and reveal their difference in substrate proteolysis and potential cell functions. These results demonstrate that proteins produced from cDNA do not necessarily reflect the original nucleotide sequence. We provide insight into the property of recombinantly expressed CAPN10 proteins in cultured cells circumventing unexpected protein products.
PXD029692	34907161	Convergent use of phosphatidic acid for hepatitis C virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication organelle formation. 	Phosphatidic acid features double membrane vesicle formation during Hepatitis C and SARS-CoV-2 infection	DMVs, Hepatitis C, SARS-CoV-2, lipid phosphatidic acid	Double membrane vesicles (DMVs) serve as replication organelles of plus-strand RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and SARS-CoV-2. Viral DMVs are morphologically analogous to DMVs formed during autophagy, but lipids driving their biogenesis are largely unknown. Here we show that production of the lipid phosphatidic acid (PA) by acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) 1 and 2 in the ER is important for DMV biogenesis in viral replication and autophagy. Using DMVs in HCV-replicating cells as model, we found that AGPATs are recruited to and critically contribute to HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication and proper DMV formation. An intracellular PA sensor accumulated at viral DMV formation sites, consistent with elevated levels of PA in fractions of purified DMVs analyzed by lipidomics. Apart from AGPATs, PA is generated by alternative pathways and their pharmacological inhibition also impaired HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as formation of autophagosome-like DMVs. These data identify PA as host cell lipid involved in proper replication organelle formation by HCV and SARS-CoV-2, two phylogenetically disparate viruses causing very different diseases, i.e. chronic liver disease and COVID-19, respectively. Host-targeting therapy aiming at PA synthesis pathways might be suitable to attenuate replication of these viruses.
PXD017147	34907175	Interleukin-7 receptor alpha mutational activation can initiate precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 	IL7R mutational activation can initiate Ph-like and PAX5 P80R precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia	B cells, acute lymphoblastic leukemia	Interleukin-7 receptor alpha (encoded by IL7R) is essential for lymphoid development. Whether acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-related IL7R gain-of-function mutations can trigger leukemogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that lymphoid-restricted mutant IL7R, expressed at physiological levels in conditional knock-in mice, establishes a pre-leukemic stage in which B-cell precursors display self-renewal ability, initiating leukemia resembling PAX5 P80R or Ph-like human B-ALL. Full transformation associates with transcriptional upregulation of oncogenes such as Myc or Bcl2, downregulation of tumor suppressors such as Ikzf1 or Arid2, and major IL-7R signaling upregulation (involving JAK/STAT5 and PI3K/mTOR), required for leukemia cell viability. Accordingly, maximal signaling drives full penetrance and early leukemia onset in homozygous IL7R mutant animals. Notably, we identify 2 transcriptional subgroups in mouse and human Ph-like ALL, and show that dactolisib and sphingosine-kinase inhibitors are potential treatment avenues for IL-7R-related cases. Our model, a resource to explore the pathophysiology and therapeutic vulnerabilities of B-ALL, demonstrates that IL7R can initiate this malignancy.
PXD027819	34907205	Nanoparticles and photochemistry for native-like transmembrane protein footprinting. 	Nanoparticles and photochemistry for Native-like transmembrane protein footprinting	footprinting, membrane protein	Mass spectrometry-based footprinting can probe higher order structure of soluble proteins in their native states and serve as a complement to high-resolution approaches. Traditional footprinting approaches, however, are hampered for integral membrane proteins because their transmembrane regions are not accessible to solvent, and they contain hydrophobic residues that are generally unreactive with most chemical reagents. To address this limitation, we bond photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles to a lipid bilayer. Upon laser irradiation, the nanoparticles produce local concentrations of radicals that penetrate the lipid layer, which is made permeable by a simultaneous laser-initiated Paterno-Buchi reaction. This approach achieves footprinting for integral membrane proteins in liposomes, helps locate both ligand-binding residues in a transporter and ligand-induced conformational changes, and reveals structural aspects of proteins at the flexible unbound state. Overall, this approach proves effective in intramembrane footprinting and forges a connection between material science and biology.
PXD029749	34908404	A Chemoproteomics Approach to Profile Phospholipase D-Derived Phosphatidyl Alcohol Interactions. 	A chemoproteomics approach to profile phospholipase D-derived phosphatidyl alcohol interactions	CuAAC, Phospholipase D, basigin, click chemistry, diazirene, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidyl alcohol, phosphatidyl ethanol, photoaffinity label	Alcohol consumption leads to formation of phosphatidylethanol (PEth) via the transphosphatidylation activity of phospholipase D (PLD) enzymes. Though this non-natural phospholipid routinely serves as a biomarker of chronic alcoholism, its pathophysiological roles remain unknown. We use a minimalist diazirine alkyne alcohol as an ethanol surrogate to generate clickable, photoaffinity lipid reporters of PEth localization and lipid-protein interactions via PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation. We use these tools to visualize phosphatidyl alcohols in a manner compatible with standard permeabilization and immunofluorescence methods. We also use click chemistry tagging, enrichment, and proteomics analysis to define the phosphatidyl alcohol interactome. Our analysis reveals an enrichment of putative interactors at various membrane locations, and we validate one such interaction with the single-pass transmembrane protein basigin/CD147. This study provides a comprehensive view of the molecular interactions of phosphatidyl alcohols with the cellular proteome and points to future work to connect such interactions to potential pathophysiological roles of PEth.
PXD028062	34908430	Combined Transcriptome and Proteome Profiling for Role of pfEMP1 in Antimalarial Mechanism of Action of Dihydroartemisinin. 	Combined transcriptome and proteome profiling for role of pfEMP1 in antimalarial mechanism of action of dihydroartemisin	dihydroartemisin, iRBC membrane proteome, malaria, mode of action	Malaria parasites induce morphological and biochemical changes in the membranes of parasite-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) for propagation. Artemisinin combination therapies are the first-line antiplasmodials in countries of endemicity. However, the mechanism of action of artemisinin is unclear, and drug resistance decreases long-term efficacy. To understand whether artemisinin targets or interacts with iRBC membrane proteins, this study investigated the molecular changes caused by dihydroartemisinin (DHA), an artemisinin derivative, in Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 using a combined transcriptomic and membrane proteomic profiling approach. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that DHA can cause morphological variation in the iRBC membrane. We identified 125 differentially expressed membrane proteins, and functional analysis indicated structural molecule activity and protein export as key biological functions of the two omics studies. DHA treatment decreased the expression of var gene variants PF3D7_0415700 and PF3D7_0900100 dose-dependently. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis showed that DHA treatment downregulates the var gene encoding P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (pfEMP1). pfEMP1 knockout significantly increased artemisinin sensitivity. Results showed that pfEMP1 might be involved in the antimalarial mechanism of action of DHA and pfEMP1 or its regulated factors may be further exploited in antiparasitic drug design. The findings are beneficial for elucidating the potential effects of DHA on iRBC membrane proteins and developing new drugs targeting iRBC membrane.

PXD024115	34908431	Evaluation of Sample Preservation and Storage Methods for Metaproteomics Analysis of Intestinal Microbiomes. 	Comparison of preservation and storage methods for metaproteomics of intestinal microbiome samples	1D-LC, MS/MS, fecal, gut, intestinal, metaproteome, metaproteomics, microbiome, microbiota, preservation., storage	A critical step in studies of the intestinal microbiome using meta-omics approaches is the preservation of samples before analysis. Preservation is essential for approaches that measure gene expression, such as metaproteomics, which is used to identify and quantify proteins in microbiomes. Intestinal microbiome samples are typically stored by flash-freezing and storage at -80degreesC, but some experimental setups do not allow for immediate freezing of samples. In this study, we evaluated methods to preserve fecal microbiome samples for metaproteomics analyses when flash-freezing is not possible. We collected fecal samples from C57BL/6 mice and stored them for 1 and 4 weeks using the following methods: flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen, immersion in RNAlater, immersion in 95% ethanol, immersion in a RNAlater-like buffer, and combinations of these methods. After storage, we extracted protein and prepared peptides for liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to identify and quantify peptides and proteins. All samples produced highly similar metaproteomes, except for ethanol-preserved samples that were distinct from all other samples in terms of protein identifications and protein abundance profiles. Flash-freezing and RNAlater (or RNAlater-like treatments) produced metaproteomes that differed only slightly, with less than 0.7% of identified proteins differing in abundance. In contrast, ethanol preservation resulted in an average of 9.5% of the identified proteins differing in abundance between ethanol and the other treatments. Our results suggest that preservation at room temperature in RNAlater or an RNAlater-like solution performs as well as freezing for the preservation of intestinal microbiome samples before metaproteomics analyses. IMPORTANCE Metaproteomics is a powerful tool to study the intestinal microbiome. By identifying and quantifying a large number of microbial, dietary, and host proteins in microbiome samples, metaproteomics provides direct evidence of the activities and functions of microbial community members. A critical step for metaproteomics workflows is preserving samples before analysis because protein profiles are susceptible to fast changes in response to changes in environmental conditions (air exposure, temperature changes, etc.). This study evaluated the effects of different preservation treatments on the metaproteomes of intestinal microbiome samples. In contrast to prior work on preservation of fecal samples for metaproteomics analyses, we ensured that all steps of sample preservation were identical so that all differences could be attributed to the preservation method.
PXD024063	34909668	Chronic treatment with terbutaline increases glucose and oleic acid oxidation and protein synthesis in cultured human myotubes. 	Chronic treatment with terbutaline increases glucose and oleic acid oxidation and protein synthesis in cultured human myotubes	Beta adrenergic receptor, energy metabolism, mitochondrial metabolism, myotubes, oxidation	OBJECTIVE: In vivo studies have reported several beneficial metabolic effects of beta-adrenergic receptor agonist administration in skeletal muscle, including increased glucose uptake, fatty acid metabolism, lipolysis and mitochondrial biogenesis. Although these effects have been widely studied in vivo, the in vitro data are limited to mouse and rat cell lines. Therefore, we sought to discover the effects of the beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline on metabolism and protein synthesis in human primary skeletal muscle cells. METHODS: Human cultured myotubes were exposed to terbutaline in various concentrations (0.01-30 muM) for 4 or 96 h. Thereafter uptake of [(14)C]deoxy-D-glucose, oxydation of [(14)C]glucose and [(14)C]oleic acid were measured. Incorporation of [(14)C]leucine, gene expression by qPCR and proteomics analyses by mass spectrometry by the STAGE-TIP method were performed after 96 h exposure to 1 and 10 muM of terbutaline. RESULTS: The results showed that 4 h treatment with terbutaline in concentrations up to 1 muM increased glucose uptake in human myotubes, but also decreased both glucose and oleic acid oxidation along with oleic acid uptake in concentrations of 10-30 muM. Moreover, administration of terbutaline for 96 h increased glucose uptake (in terbutaline concentrations up to 1 muM) and oxidation (1 muM), as well as oleic acid oxidation (0.1-30 muM), leucine incorporation into cellular protein (1-10 muM) and upregulated several pathways related to mitochondrial metabolism (1 muM). Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD024063. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that beta2-adrenergic receptor have direct effects in human skeletal muscle affecting fuel metabolism and net protein synthesis, effects that might be favourable for both type 2 diabetes and muscle wasting disorders.
PXD024018	34909734	Kininogen-Nitric Oxide Signaling at Nearby Nonexcited Acupoints after Long-Term Stimulation. 	Kininogen-Nitric Oxide Signaling at Nearby Non-excited Acupoints After Long-term Stimulation	KNG-nitric oxide signaling pathway,Acupoints, Long-term Stimulation,	Acupuncture treatment is based on acupoint stimulation; however, the biological basis is not understood. We stimulated one acupoint with catgut embedding for 8 weeks and then used isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation to screen proteins with altered expression in adjacent acupoints of Sprague Dawley rats. We found that kininogen expression was significantly upregulated in the stimulated and the nonstimulated adjacent acupoints along the same meridian. The enhanced kininogen expression was meridian dependent and was most apparent among small vessels in the subcutaneous layer. Enhanced signals of nitric oxide synthases, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and myosin light chain were also observed at the nonstimulated adjacent acupoints along the same meridian. These findings uncover biological changes at acupoints and suggest the critical role of the kininogen-nitric oxide signaling pathway in acupoint activation.
PXD027089	34911956	Copper depletion modulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to impair triple negative breast cancer metastasis. 	Copper depletion modulates OXPHOS in SOX2/OCT4+ cancer cells to impair triple negative breast cancer metastasis.	AMPK, Copper, Metabolism, Metastasis, Mitochondria, OXPHOS, SOX2/OCT4+ cells, Tetrathiomolybdate, Triple negative breast cancer	Copper serves as a co-factor for a host of metalloenzymes that contribute to malignant progression. The orally bioavailable copper chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate (TM) has been associated with a significant survival benefit in high-risk triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Despite these promising data, the mechanisms by which copper depletion impacts metastasis are poorly understood and this remains a major barrier to advancing TM to a randomized phase II trial. Here, using two independent TNBC models, we report a discrete subpopulation of highly metastatic SOX2/OCT4+ cells within primary tumors that exhibit elevated intracellular copper levels and a marked sensitivity to TM. Global proteomic and metabolomic profiling identifies TM-mediated inactivation of Complex IV as the primary metabolic defect in the SOX2/OCT4+ cell population. We also identify AMPK/mTORC1 energy sensor as an important downstream pathway and show that AMPK inhibition rescues TM-mediated loss of invasion. Furthermore, loss of the mitochondria-specific copper chaperone, COX17, restricts copper deficiency to mitochondria and phenocopies TM-mediated alterations. These findings identify a copper-metabolism-metastasis axis with potential to enrich patient populations in next-generation therapeutic trials.
PXD023217	34911965	Critical Assessment of MetaProteome Investigation (CAMPI): a multi-laboratory comparison of established workflows. 	Critical Assessment of Metaproteome Investigation (CAMPI): a Multi-Lab Comparison of Established Workflows	ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, metaproteomics, microbial communities, multi-omics	Metaproteomics has matured into a powerful tool to assess functional interactions in microbial communities. While many metaproteomic workflows are available, the impact of method choice on results remains unclear. Here, we carry out a community-driven, multi-laboratory comparison in metaproteomics: the critical assessment of metaproteome investigation study (CAMPI). Based on well-established workflows, we evaluate the effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified, laboratory-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal sample. We observe that variability at the peptide level is predominantly due to sample processing workflows, with a smaller contribution of bioinformatic pipelines. These peptide-level differences largely disappear at the protein group level. While differences are observed for predicted community composition, similar functional profiles are obtained across workflows. CAMPI demonstrates the robustness of present-day metaproteomics research, serves as a template for multi-laboratory studies in metaproteomics, and provides publicly available data sets for benchmarking future developments.
PXD027269	34912214	Induction of PI3K/Akt-Mediated Apoptosis in Osteoclasts Is a Key Approach for Buxue Tongluo Pills to Treat Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head. 	Analysis of components of Buxuetongluo Pills by LC-MS/MS	Buxuetongluo Pills, component	The Buxue Tongluo pill (BTP) is a self-made pill with the functions of nourishing blood, promoting blood circulation, dredging collaterals, and relieving pain. It consists of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels, Pheretima aspergillum (E.Perrier), Panax notoginseng (Burk.) F. H. Chen, Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. Various clinical practices have confirmed the therapeutic effect of BTP on osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), but little attention has been paid to the study of its bioactive ingredients and related mechanisms of action. In this study, UPLC/MS-MS combined with GEO data mining was used to construct a bioactive ingredient library of BTP and a differentially expressed gene (DEG) library for ONFH. Subsequently, Cytoscape (3.7.2) software was used to analyze the protein-protein interaction between BTP and DEGs of ONFH to screen the key targets, and functional annotation analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were carried out. Finally, 34 bioactive compounds were screened, which acted on 1,232 targets. A total of 178 DEGs were collected, and 17 key genes were obtained after two screenings. By bioinformatics annotation on these key genes, a total of 354 gene ontology (GO) functional annotation analyses and 42 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were obtained. The present study found that GO and KEGG enrichment were mainly related to apoptosis, suggesting that BTP may exert an anti-ONFH effect by promoting osteoclast apoptosis. Experiments in vitro demonstrated that BTP could increase the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and induce remarkable apoptosis in osteoclasts. Furthermore, we determined the apoptosis marker of cleaved(C)-caspase-3, bcl-2, and bax and found that BTP could upregulate the C-caspase-3 and bax expression in osteoclasts and decrease the expression of bcl-2, p-Akt, and p-PI3K in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that BTP could induce PI3K/Akt-mediated apoptosis in osteoclasts to treat ONFH. This study explored the pharmacodynamic basis and mechanism of BTP against ONFH from the perspective of systemic pharmacology, laying a foundation for further elucidating the therapeutic effects of BTP against ONFH.
PXD028073	34913074	Anterior gradient protein 2 is a marker of tumor aggressiveness in breast cancer and favors chemotherapy-induced senescence escape. 	Anterior Gradient protein 2 is a marker of tumor aggressiveness in breast cancer and favors chemotherapy-induced senescence escape.	AGR2, Chemotherapy, Senescence	Among the different chemotherapies available, genotoxic drugs are widely used. In response to these drugs, particularly doxorubicin, tumor cells can enter into senescence. Chemotherapy-induced senescence (CIS) is a complex response. Long described as a definitive arrest of cell proliferation, the present authors and various groups have shown that this state may not be complete and could allow certain cells to reproliferate. The mechanism could be due to the activation of new signaling pathways. In the laboratory, the proteins involved in these pathways and triggering cell proliferation were studied. The present study determined a new role for anterior gradient protein 2 (AGR2) in vivo in patients and in vitro in a senescence escape model. AGR2's implication in breast cancer patients and proliferation of senescent cells was assessed based on a SWATH-MS proteomic study of patients' samples and RNA interference technology on cell lines. First, AGR2 was identified and it was found that its concentration is higher in the serum of patients with breast cancer and that this high concentration is associated with metastasis occurrence. An inverse correlation between intratumoral AGR2 expression and the senescence marker p16 was also observed. This observation led to the study of the role of AGR2 in the CIS escape model. In this model, it was found that AGR2 is overexpressed in cells during senescence escape and that its loss considerably reduces this phenomenon. Furthermore, it was shown that the extracellular form of AGR2 stimulated the reproliferation of senescent cells. The power of proteomic analysis based on the SWATH-MS approach allowed the present study to highlight the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/AKT signaling pathway in the senescence escape mechanism mediated by AGR2. Analysis of the two signaling pathways revealed that AGR2 modulated RICTOR and AKT phosphorylation. All these results showed that AGR2 expression in sera and tumors of breast cancer patients is a marker of tumor progression and metastasis occurrence. They also showed that its overexpression regulates CIS escape via activation of the mTOR/AKT signaling pathway.
PXD029248	34913092	PA28gamma-20S proteasome is a proteolytic complex committed to degrade unfolded proteins. 	Study of peptides produced during proteasomal degradation of MBP (Myelin basic protein) and IGF-1 (insuline-like growth factor 1) in presence and absence of   PA28gamma	ATP-independent proteolysis, PA28gamma, proteasome, proteasome activator, proteasome gate, protein degradation	PA28gamma is a nuclear activator of the 20S proteasome that, unlike the 19S regulatory particle, stimulates hydrolysis of several substrates in an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent manner and whose exact biological functions and molecular mechanism of action still remain elusive. In an effort to shed light on these important issues, we investigated the stimulatory effect of PA28gamma on the hydrolysis of different fluorogenic peptides and folded or denatured full-length proteins by the 20S proteasome. Importantly, PA28gamma was found to dramatically enhance breakdown rates by 20S proteasomes of several naturally or artificially unstructured proteins, but not of their native, folded counterparts. Furthermore, these data were corroborated by experiments in cell lines with a nucleus-tagged myelin basic protein. Finally, mass spectrometry analysis of the products generated during proteasomal degradation of two proteins demonstrated that PA28gamma does not increase, but rather decreases, the variability of peptides that are potentially suitable for MHC class I antigen presentation. These unexpected findings indicate that global stimulation of the degradation of unfolded proteins may represent a more general feature of PA28gamma and suggests that this proteasomal activator might play a broader role in the pathway of protein degradation than previously believed.
PXD029106	34913994	Hyperosmolarity adversely impacts recombinant protein synthesis by Yarrowia lipolytica-molecular background revealed by quantitative proteomics. 	Hyperosmolarity adversely impacts heterologous secretory protein synthesis by Yarrowia lipolytica 	Yarrowia lipolytica, heterologous protein, hyperosmolarity, stress response	In this research, we were interested in answering a question whether subjecting a Yarrowia lipolytica strain overproducing a recombinant secretory protein (rs-Prot) to pre-optimized stress factors may enhance synthesis of the rs-Prot. Increased osmolarity (3 Osm kg(-1)) was the primary stress factor implemented alone or in combination with decreased temperature (20 degreesC), known to promote synthesis of rs-Prots. The treatments were executed in batch bioreactor cultures, and the cellular response was studied in terms of culture progression, gene expression and global proteomics, to get insight into molecular bases underlying an awaken reaction. Primarily, we observed that hyperosmolarity executed by high sorbitol concentration does not enhance synthesis of the rs-Prot but increases its transcription. Expectedly, hyperosmolarity induced synthesis of polyols at the expense of citric acid synthesis and growth, which was severely limited. A number of stress-related proteins were upregulated, including heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and aldo-keto reductases, as observed at transcriptomics and proteomics levels. Concerted downregulation of central carbon metabolism, including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid synthesis, highlighted redirection of carbon fluxes. Elevated abundance of HSPs and osmolytes did not outbalance the severe limitation of protein synthesis, marked by orchestrated downregulation of translation (elongation factors, several aa-tRNA synthetases), amino acid biosynthesis and ribosome biogenesis in response to the hyperosmolarity. Altogether we settled that increased osmolarity is not beneficial for rs-Prots synthesis in Y. lipolytica, even though some elements of the response could assist this process. Insight into global changes in the yeast proteome under the treatments is provided. KEY POINTS: * Temp enhances, but Osm decreases rs-Prots synthesis by Y. lipolytica. * Enhanced abundance of HSPs and osmolytes is overweighted by limited translation. * Global proteome under Osm, Temp and Osm Temp treatments was studied.
PXD024517	34916496	R-loop proximity proteomics identifies a role of DDX41 in transcription-associated genomic instability. 	R-loop proximity proteomics identifies a role of DDX41 in transcription-associated genomic instabilityR-loop proximity proteomics identifies a role of DDX41 in transcription-associated genomic instability	R-loop DDX41	Transcription poses a threat to genomic stability through the formation of R-loops that can obstruct progression of replication forks. R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures formed by an RNA-DNA hybrid with a displaced non-template DNA strand. We developed RNA-DNA Proximity Proteomics to map the R-loop proximal proteome of human cells using quantitative mass spectrometry. We implicate different cellular proteins in R-loop regulation and identify a role of the tumor suppressor DDX41 in opposing R-loop and double strand DNA break accumulation in promoters. DDX41 is enriched in promoter regions in vivo, and can unwind RNA-DNA hybrids in vitro. R-loop accumulation upon loss of DDX41 is accompanied with replication stress, an increase in the formation of double strand DNA breaks and transcriptome changes associated with the inflammatory response. Germline loss-of-function mutations in DDX41 lead to predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia in adulthood. We propose that R-loop accumulation and genomic instability-associated inflammatory response may contribute to the development of familial AML with mutated DDX41.
PXD029429	34916658	TREM2 interacts with TDP-43 and mediates microglial neuroprotection against TDP-43-related neurodegeneration. 	TREM2 interacts with TDP-43 and mediates microglial neuroprotection against TDP-43-related neurodegeneration		Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell 2 (TREM2) is linked to risk of neurodegenerative disease. However, the function of TREM2 in neurodegeneration is still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of microglial TREM2 in TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-related neurodegeneration using virus-mediated and transgenic mouse models. We found that TREM2 deficiency impaired phagocytic clearance of pathological TDP-43 by microglia and enhanced neuronal damage and motor impairments. Mass cytometry analysis revealed that human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) induced a TREM2-dependent subpopulation of microglia with high CD11c expression and phagocytic ability. Using mass spectrometry (MS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, we further demonstrated an interaction between TDP-43 and TREM2 in vitro and in vivo as well as in human tissues from individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We computationally identified regions within hTDP-43 that interact with TREM2. Our data highlight that TDP-43 is a possible ligand for microglial TREM2 and that this interaction mediates neuroprotection of microglia in TDP-43-related neurodegeneration.
PXD025079	34917178	Proteomic analysis of human umbilical cord serum exosomes using mass spectrometry and preliminary study of their biological activities in liver cancer cell lines. 	Proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from human umbilical cord serum by mass spectrometry and preliminary study of their biological activities in cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines	Exosomes, hepatocellular carcinoma, human umbilical cord serum, proteomic analysis	Exosomes are membranous extracellular vesicles 50-100 nm in size, which are involved in cellular communication via the delivery of proteins, lipids and RNA. Emerging evidence shows that exosomes play a critical role in cancer. It has recently been revealed that maternal and umbilical cord serum (UCS)-derived exosomes may enhance endothelial cell proliferation and migration. However, the role of exosomes isolated from the human umbilical cord in cancer development has not been investigated. To explore the potential differences in the composition and function of proteins from umbilical serum exosomes (UEs) and maternal serum exosomes, a proteomic analysis of exosomes was conducted using mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Moreover, Cell Counting Kit-8 assays and flow cytometry were used to study the biological effects of UEs on liver cancer cell lines. The present study demonstrated that UCS was enriched with proteins involved in extracellular matrix-receptor interactions, which may be closely related to cell metastasis and proliferation. The findings further indicated that exosomes derived from human umbilical serum could inhibit the viability and induce apoptosis of liver cancer cells. This suggests that UCS-derived exosomes may represent potential leads for the development of biotherapy for liver cancer.
PXD029458	34918453	Assessing interference in isobaric tag-based sample multiplexing using an 18-plex interference standard. 	Assessing Interference in Isobaric Tag-based Sample Multiplexing using an 18-plex Interference Standard	Eclipse, FAIMS, IFI, RTS, SPS-MS3, TMTpro18	Reporter ion interference remains a limitation of isobaric tag-based sample multiplexing. Advances in instrumentation and data acquisition modes, such as the recently developed real-time database search (RTS), can reduce interference. However, interference persists as does the need to benchmark upstream sample preparation and data acquisition strategies. Here, we present an updated Triple yeast KnockOut (TKO) standard as well as corresponding upgrades to the TKO viewing tool (TVT2.5, http://tko.hms.harvard.edu/). Specifically, we expand the TKO standard to incorporate the TMTpro18-plex reagents (TKO18). We also construct a variant thereof which has been digested only with LysC (TKO18L). We compare proteome coverage and interference levels of TKO18 and TKO18L data that are acquired under different data acquisition modes and analyzed using TVT2.5. Our data illustrate that RTS reduces interference while improving proteome coverage and suggest that digesting with LysC alone only modestly reduces interference, albeit at the expense of proteome depth. Collectively, the two new TKO standards coupled with the updated TVT represent a convenient and versatile platform for assessing and developing methods to reduce interference in isobaric tag-based experiments.
PXD029665	34919405	Skyline Batch: An Intuitive User Interface for Batch Processing with Skyline. 	Reprocessed dataset with Skyline Batch: SWATH Analysis of Yeast Proteome over Time in Response to Osmotic Stress	Skyline, data analysis, reprocessing, reproducible, software, workflow	Skyline Batch is a newly developed Windows forms application that enables the easy and consistent reprocessing of data with Skyline. Skyline has made previous advances in this direction; however, none enable seamless automated reprocessing of local and remote files. Skyline keeps a log of all of the steps that were taken in the document; however, reproducing these steps takes time and allows room for human error. Skyline also has a command-line interface, enabling it to be run from a batch script, but using the program in this way requires expertise in editing these scripts. By formalizing the workflow of a highly used set of batch scripts into an intuitive and powerful user interface, Skyline Batch can reprocess data stored in remote repositories just by opening and running a Skyline Batch configuration file. When run, a Skyline Batch configuration downloads all necessary remote files and then runs a four-step Skyline workflow. By condensing the steps needed to reprocess the data into one file, Skyline Batch gives researchers the opportunity to publish their processing along with their data and other analysis files. These easily run configuration files will greatly increase the transparency and reproducibility of published work. Skyline Batch is freely available at https://skyline.ms/batch.url.
PXD029520	34919781	Androgen receptor-mediated transcriptional repression targets cell plasticity in prostate cancer. 	Transcriptional repression activity of androgen receptor targets cell plasticity in prostate cancer: kinetic analysis after DHT treatment	AR-V7, Androgen receptor, Cell plasticity, EMT, Prostate cancer, Transcriptional repression	Androgen receptor (AR) signaling remains the key therapeutic target in the management of hormone-naive-advanced prostate cancer (PCa) and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Recently, landmark molecular features have been reported for CRPC, including the expression of constitutively active AR variants that lack the ligand-binding domain. Besides their role in CRPC, AR variants lead to the expression of genes involved in tumor progression. However, little is known about the specificity of their mode of action compared with that of wild-type AR (AR-WT). We performed AR transcriptome analyses in an androgen-dependent PCa cell line as well as cross-analyses with publicly available RNA-seq datasets and established that transcriptional repression capacity that was marked for AR-WT was pathologically lost by AR variants. Functional enrichment analyses allowed us to associate AR-WT repressive function to a panel of genes involved in cell adhesion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. So, we postulate that a less documented AR-WT normal function in prostate epithelial cells could be the repression of a panel of genes linked to cell plasticity and that this repressive function could be pathologically abrogated by AR variants in PCa.
PXD022484	34921158	Heterocellular OSM-OSMR signalling reprograms fibroblasts to promote pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis. 	Heterocellular OSM-OSMR signalling drives pancreatic tumour growth and metastasis through functional fibroblast reprogramming	PDA, Phosphoproteomics	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal malignancy with a complex microenvironment. Dichotomous tumour-promoting and -restrictive roles have been ascribed to the tumour microenvironment, however the effects of individual stromal subsets remain incompletely characterised. Here, we describe how heterocellular Oncostatin M (OSM) - Oncostatin M Receptor (OSMR) signalling reprograms fibroblasts, regulates tumour growth and metastasis. Macrophage-secreted OSM stimulates inflammatory gene expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which in turn induce a pro-tumourigenic environment and engage tumour cell survival and migratory signalling pathways. Tumour cells implanted in Osm-deficient (Osm(-/-)) mice display an epithelial-dominated morphology, reduced tumour growth and do not metastasise. Moreover, the tumour microenvironment of Osm(-/-) animals exhibit increased abundance of alpha smooth muscle actin positive myofibroblasts and a shift in myeloid and T cell phenotypes, consistent with a more immunogenic environment. Taken together, these data demonstrate how OSM-OSMR signalling coordinates heterocellular interactions to drive a pro-tumourigenic environment in PDA.
PXD019636	34921643	Floral organ-specific proteome profiling of the floral ornamental orchid (Cymbidium goeringii) reveals candidate proteins related to floral organ development. 	Orchid tissue TMT Quantitative analysis	Orchid TMT	BACKGROUND: Cymbidium goeringii, belonging to the Orchidaceae family, is an important ornamental plant with striking petals and lips. Extremely diversified floral patterns and morphologies make C. goeringii good research material to examine floral development of orchids. However, no floral organ-specific protein has been identified yet. To screen floral development associated proteins, four proteomes from petal (PE), lip (LI), gynostemium (GY), and sepal (SE) were analyzed using Tandem Mass Tag-based proteomic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 6626 unique peptides encoding 2331 proteins were identified in our study. Proteins in several primary metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism, were identified as differentially expressed proteins. Interestingly, most of the energy metabolism-related proteins highly expressed in SE, indicating that SE is an important photosynthetic organ of C. goeringii flower. Furthermore, a number of phytohormone-related proteins and transcription factors (TFs) were identified in C. goeringii flowers. Expression analysis showed that 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase highly expressed in GY, IAA-amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like 4 and gibberellin receptor 1 C greatly expressed in LI, and auxin-binding protein ABP20 significantly expressed in SE, suggesting a significant role of hormones in the regulation of flower morphogenesis and development. For TFs, GY-highly expressed bHLH13, PE-highly expressed WRKY33, and GY-highly expressed VIP1, were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Mining of floral organ differential expressed enzymes and TFs helps us to excavate candidate proteins related to floral organ development and to accelerate the breeding of Cymbidium plants.
PXD030553	34922009	DIA-Based Proteomics Identifies IDH2 as a Targetable Regulator of Acquired Drug Resistance in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. 	KMDR:K562 multi-drug resistance	K562, pulseDIA	Drug resistance is a critical obstacle to effective treatment in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. To understand the underlying resistance mechanisms in response to imatinib mesylate (IMA) and adriamycin (ADR), the parental K562 cells were treated with low doses of IMA or ADR for 2 months to generate derivative cells with mild, intermediate, and severe resistance to the drugs as defined by their increasing resistance index. PulseDIA-based (DIA [data-independent acquisition]) quantitative proteomics was then employed to reveal the proteome changes in these resistant cells. In total, 7082 proteins from 98,232 peptides were identified and quantified from the dataset using four DIA software tools including OpenSWATH, Spectronaut, DIA-NN, and EncyclopeDIA. Sirtuin signaling pathway was found to be significantly enriched in both ADR-resistant and IMA-resistant K562 cells. In particular, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 2 was identified as a potential drug target correlated with the drug resistance phenotype, and its inhibition by the antagonist AGI-6780 reversed the acquired resistance in K562 cells to either ADR or IMA. Together, our study has implicated isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 2 as a potential target that can be therapeutically leveraged to alleviate the drug resistance in K562 cells when treated with IMA and ADR.
PXD028644	34922014	Proteomic analysis reveals the metabolic versatility of Amycolatopsis sp. BX17: A strain native from milpa agroecosystem soil. 	Proteomic analysis reveals metabolic versatility of Amycolatopsis sp. BX17: a strain native from milpa agroecosystem soil	Actinobacteria, Antifungal activity, Conservation agriculture, Intracellular proteins, Metabolism	Amycolatopsis sp. BX17 is an actinobacterium isolated from milpa soils, which antagonizes the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum. Metabolites secreted by the actinobacterium cultured in glucose-free medium inhibited 100% of the mycelial growth of F. graminearum RH1, while the inhibition rate was 65% in medium supplemented with 20 g/L glucose. With the aim of studying how the metabolism of strain BX17 is modulated by glucose as the main carbon source, media with 0 and 20 g/L glucose were selected to analyze the intracellular proteins by quantitative label-free proteomic analysis. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD028644. Proteins identified in bacteria cultured in medium without glucose were involved in glutamate metabolism, the Krebs cycle and the shikimate pathway, suggesting that amino acids are metabolized to synthesize antifungal compounds. In glucose-containing medium, carbon flux was directed mainly toward the synthesis of energy and cell growth. This study shows the metabolic versatility of Amycolatopsis BX17, and strengthens its potential use in designing biotechnological strategies for phytopathogen control. SIGNIFICANCE: Amycolatopsis BX17 is a bacterium isolated from milpa agroecosystems that antagonizes the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum. Currently, there is scarce information about the metabolism involved in the biosynthesis of antifungal agents by this genus. We used a label-free proteomic approach to identify the differences in metabolic routes for antifungal biosynthesis in Amycolatopsis BX17 grown in media with 0 and 20 g/L glucose. Taken together the results suggest that the BX17 strain could be synthesizing the antifungal metabolite(s) from the Shikimate pathway through the synthesis and degradation of the amino acid tyrosine, which is a known precursor of glycopeptides with antibiotic and antifungal activity. While the lower antifungal activity of the metabolites secreted by Amycolatopsis BX17 when grown in a medium with glucose as the main carbon source, may be correlated with a lower synthesis of antifungal compounds, due to the directing of carbon flux toward metabolic pathways involved with energy synthesis and cell growth. Likewise, it is possible that the bacteria synthesize other compounds with biological activity, such as glycopeptides with antibiotic activity. These findings are relevant because they represent the first stage to understand the metabolic regulation involved in the biosynthesis of antifungal metabolites by the genus Amycolatopsis. Finally, improving our understanding of the metabolic regulation involved in the biosynthesis of antifungal metabolites is essential to design of strategies in agricultural biotechnology for phytopathogen control.
PXD025858	34923141	Glutamine-Fructose-6-Phosphate Transaminase 2 (GFPT2) Is Upregulated in Breast Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Responds to Oxidative Stress. 	Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (GFPT2) is upregulated in breast epithelial-mesenchymal transition and involved in oxidative stress regulation.	EMT, GFPT2, breast cancer, claudin-low, metabolism, oxidative stress	Breast cancer cells that have undergone partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are believed to be more invasive than cells that have completed EMT. To study metabolic reprogramming in different mesenchymal states, we analyzed protein expression following EMT in the breast epithelial cell model D492 with single-shot LFQ supported by a SILAC proteomics approach. The D492 EMT cell model contains three cell lines: the epithelial D492 cells, the mesenchymal D492M cells, and a partial mesenchymal, tumorigenic variant of D492 that overexpresses the oncogene HER2. The analysis classified the D492 and D492M cells as basal-like and D492HER2 as claudin-low. Comparative analysis of D492 and D492M to tumorigenic D492HER2 differentiated metabolic markers of migration from those of invasion. Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (GFPT2) was one of the top dysregulated enzymes in D492HER2. Gene expression analysis of the cancer genome atlas showed that GFPT2 expression was a characteristic of claudin-low breast cancer. siRNA-mediated knockdown of GFPT2 influenced the EMT marker vimentin and both cell growth and invasion in vitro and was accompanied by lowered metabolic flux through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). Knockdown of GFPT2 decreased cystathionine and sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) in the transsulfuration pathway that regulates H2S production and mitochondrial homeostasis. Moreover, GFPT2 was within the regulation network of insulin and EGF, and its expression was regulated by reduced glutathione (GSH) and suppressed by the oxidative stress regulator GSK3-beta. Our results demonstrate that GFPT2 controls growth and invasion in the D492 EMT model, is a marker for oxidative stress, and associated with poor prognosis in claudin-low breast cancer.
PXD028772	34923300	Peroxiredoxin 6 protects irradiated cells from oxidative stress and shapes their senescence-associated cytokine landscape. 	Peroxiredoxin 6 protects irradiated cells from oxidative stress and shapes their senescence-associated cytokine landscape, secretome analysis	DIA, Exploris, cellular senescence, ionizing radiation, peroxiredoxin 6, secretome analysis	Cellular senescence is a complex stress response defined as an essentially irreversible cell cycle arrest mediated by the inhibition of cell cycle-specific cyclin dependent kinases. The imbalance in redox homeostasis and oxidative stress have been repeatedly observed as one of the hallmarks of the senescent phenotype. However, a large-scale study investigating protein oxidation and redox signaling in senescent cells in vitro has been lacking. Here we applied a proteome-wide analysis using SILAC-iodoTMT workflow to quantitatively estimate the level of protein sulfhydryl oxidation and proteome level changes in ionizing radiation-induced senescence (IRIS) in hTERT-RPE-1 cells. We observed that senescent cells mobilized the antioxidant system to buffer the increased oxidation stress. Among the antioxidant proteins with increased relative abundance in IRIS, a unique 1-Cys peroxiredoxin family member, peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), was identified as an important contributor to protection against oxidative stress. PRDX6 silencing increased ROS production in senescent cells, decreased their resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell death, and impaired their viability. Subsequent SILAC-iodoTMT and secretome analysis after PRDX6 silencing showed the downregulation of PRDX6 in IRIS affected protein secretory pathways, decreased expression of extracellular matrix proteins, and led to unexpected attenuation of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The latter was exemplified by decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 which was also confirmed after treatment with an inhibitor of PRDX6 iPLA2 activity, MJ33. In conclusion, by combining different methodological approaches we discovered a novel role of PRDX6 in senescent cell viability and SASP development. Our results suggest PRDX6 could have a potential as a drug target for senolytic or senomodulatory therapy.
PXD026082	34923920	Functionality of the human antibody response to Candida albicans. 	Human antibodies enhance association of macrophages to Candida albicans and reduce fungal-mediated epithelial damage	Candida albicans, IgG, Privigen, macrophages, secreted aspartyl proteases	Candida albicans is a common commensal on human mucosal surfaces, but can become pathogenic, e.g. if the host is immunocompromised. While neutrophils, macrophages and T cells are regarded as major players in the defense against pathogenic C. albicans, the role of B cells and the protective function of their antibodies are less well characterized. In this study, we show that human serum antibodies are able to enhance the association of human THP-1 monocyte-like cells with C. albicans cells. Human serum antibodies are also capable of inhibiting the adherence and damage dealt to epithelial cells. Furthermore, human serum antibodies impair C. albicans invasion of human oral epithelial cells by blocking induced endocytosis and consequently host cell damage. While aspartic proteases secreted by C. albicans are able to cleave human IgG, this process does not appear to affect the protective function of human antibodies. Thus, humans are equipped with a robust antibody response to C. albicans, which can enhance antifungal activities and prevent fungal-mediated epithelial damage.
PXD028448	34925365	Proteomics and Organoid Culture Reveal the Underlying Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. 	Proteomics and Organoid Culture Reveal the Underlying Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis	Hashimotos Thyroiditis	Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is an autoimmune disease, and its incidence continues to rise. Although scientists have studied this disease for many years and discovered the potential effects of various proteins in it, the specific pathogenesis is still not fully comprehended. To understand HT and translate this knowledge to clinical applications, we took the mass spectrometric analysis on thyroid tissue fine-needle puncture from HT patients and healthy people in an attempt to make a further understanding of the pathogenesis of HT. A total of 44 proteins with differential expression were identified in HT patients, and these proteins play vital roles in cell adhesion, cell metabolism, and thyroxine synthesis. Combining patient clinical trial sample information, we further compared the transient changes of gene expression regulation in HT and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) samples. More importantly, we developed patient-derived HT and PTC organoids as a promising new preclinical model to verify these potential markers. Our data revealed a marked characteristic of HT organoid in upregulating chemokines that include C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 2 and CCL3, which play a key role in the pathogenesis of HT. Overall, our research has enriched everyone's understanding of the pathogenesis of HT and provides a certain reference for the treatment of the disease.
PXD029022	34926326	Integrative Transcriptomics and Proteomics Analyses to Reveal the Developmental Regulation of Metorchis orientalis: A Neglected Trematode With Potential Carcinogenic Implications. 	Proteomics of adult and metacercariae of Metorchis orientalis	Adult stage, Metacercariae stage, Metorchis orientalis	Metorchis orientalis is a neglected zoonotic parasite of the gallbladder and bile duct of poultry, mammals, and humans. It has been widely reported in Asian, including China, Japanese, and Korea, where it is a potential threat to public health. Despite its significance as an animal and human pathogen, there are few published transcriptomic and proteomics data available. Transcriptome Illumina RNA sequencing and label-free protein quantification were performed to compare the gene and protein expression of adult and metacercariae-stage M. orientalis, resulting in 100,234 unigenes and 3,530 proteins. Of these, 13,823 differentially expressed genes and 1,445 differentially expressed proteins were identified in adult versus metacercariae. In total, 570 genes were differentially expressed consistent with the mRNA and protein level in the adult versus metacercariae stage. Differential gene transcription analyses revealed 34,228 genes to be expressed in both stages, whereas 66,006 genes showed stage-specific expression. Compared with adults, the metacercariae stage was highly transcriptional. GO and KEGG analyses based on transcriptome and proteome revealed numerous up-regulated genes in adult M. orientalis related to microtubule-based processes, microtubule motor activity, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. The up-regulated genes in metacercariae M. orientalis were mainly related to transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase activity, transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling pathway. Transcriptome and proteome comparative analyses showed numerous up-regulated genes in adult stage were mainly enriched in actin filament capping, spectrin, and glucose metabolic process, while up-regulated genes in metacercariae stage were mainly related to cilium assembly, cilium movement, and motile cilium. These results highlight changes in protein and gene functions during the development of metacercariae into adults, and provided evidence for the mechanisms involved in morphological and metabolic changes at both the protein and gene levels. Interestingly, many genes had been proved associated with liver fibrosis and carcinogenic factors were identified highly expressed in adult M. orientalis, which suggests that M. orientalis is a neglected trematode with potential carcinogenic implications. These data provide attractive targets for the development of therapeutic or diagnostic interventions for controlling M. orientalis.
PXD029296	34926462	Exploring the Mechanism of Action of Canmei Formula Against Colorectal Adenoma Through Multi-Omics Technique. 	Exploring the mechanism of action of Canmei formula against colorectal adenoma through multi-omics technique	LC-MS, colorectal adenoma	Background: Canmei formula (CMF) is a traditional Chinese medicine compound with definite effect on the prevention and treatment of colorectal adenoma (CRA). CMF can prevent the transformation of intestinal inflammation to cancer. This study explored the mechanism of action of CMF in anti-CRA using multi-omics techniques. Method: The mice were randomly divided into four groups: blank group (Control), high-fat diet (HFD) + AOM/DSS colorectal adenoma model (ADH) groups, Canmei formula treatment group (ADH-CMF) and sulfasalazine treatment group (Sul). Except for the blank group, ADH model was established in the other three groups by intraperitoneal injection with AOM reagent, and then mice were given 2.5% DSS in free drinking water and high-fat diet. The mice in the blank group and ADH groups were intragastrically perfused with normal saline, and the mice in the other two groups were treated with corresponding drugs for 20 weeks. During this period, the changes of physical signs of mice in each group were observed. The differentially expressed genes and proteins in the Control group, ADH group and ADH-CMF group were detected by RNA-seq transcriptome sequencing and Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) quantitative proteomics. After the combined analysis and verification, the key targets were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Moreover, the changes of intestinal flora in mice of the three groups were examined. Results: A total of 2,548 differential genes were obtained by transcriptomics analysis, and 45 differential proteins were obtained by proteomics analysis. The results of proteomics data and experimental verification showed that CMF mainly affected the Phospholysine Phosphohistidine Inorganic Pyrophosphate Phosphatase (LHPP) target. GO analysis showed that the targets of CMF were involved in the biological processes such as cellular process, metabolic process and biological regulation. KEGG analysis showed that those genes were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, cell senescence, and metabolic pathways. Studies have shown that LHPP overexpression impeded colorectal cancer cell growth and proliferation in vitro, and was associated with a change in PI3K/AKT activity. The results of 16S DNA high-throughput sequencing showed that CMF could effectively regulate the abundance of Bifidobacterium, Candidatus_Saccharimonas and Erysipelatoclostridium in the intestinal flora at the genus level. Conclusion: CMF regulates LHPP via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. CMF affects the abundance of specific intestinal flora and can regulate the disorder of intestinal flora to achieve the role of prevention and treatment of CRA.
PXD029034	34927332	A Membrane-Permeable and Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) Enrichable Cross-Linking Reagent to Advance In Vivo Cross-Linking Mass Spectrometry. 	A Membrane-Permeable and Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC)-Enrichable Cross-Linking Reagent to Advance In Vivo Cross-Linking Mass Spectrometry	crosslinking, protein structures, protein-protein interactions	Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) is an attractive method for the proteome-wide characterization of protein structures and interactions. Currently, the depth of in vivo XL-MS studies is lagging behind the established applications to cell lysates, because cross-linking reagents that can penetrate intact cells and strategies to enrich cross-linked peptides lack efficiency. To tackle these limitations, we have developed a phosphonate-containing cross-linker, tBu-PhoX, that efficiently permeates various biological membranes and can be robustly enriched using routine immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. We have established a tBu-PhoX-based in vivo XL-MS approach that enables cross-links in intact human cells to be identified in high numbers with substantially reduced analysis time. Collectively, the developed cross-linker and XL-MS approach pave the way for the comprehensive XL-MS characterization of living systems.
PXD027085	34928127	Ultrasensitive Trace Sample Proteomics Unraveled the Protein Remodeling during Mesenchymal-Amoeboid Transition. 	Novel integrated trace sample preparation unraveled the proteome transformation during mesenchymal-amoeboid transition	integrated sample preparation, mesenchymal-amoeboid transition, proteomic analysis, trace samples	Deep mining the proteome of trace biological samples is critical for biomedical applications. However, it remains a challenge due to the loss of analytes caused by current sample preparation procedures. To address this, we recently developed a single-pot and miniaturized in-solution digestion (SMID) method for minute sample handling with three streamlined steps and completed within 3 h. The SMID approach outperformed the traditional workflow in substantially saving time, reducing sample loss, and exhibiting extensive applicability for 10-100 000 cell analysis. This user-friendly and high-sensitivity strategy enables ~5300 proteins and 53 000 peptides to be confidently identified within 1 h of mass spectrometry (MS) time from a small amount of 1000 HeLa cells. In addition, we accurately and robustly detected proteomes in 10 mouse oocytes with excellent reproducibility. We further adopted SMID for the proteome analysis in cell migration under confinement, which induced cells to undergo a mesenchymal-amoeboid transition (MAT). During the MAT, a systematic quantitative proteome map of 1000 HeLa cells was constructed with seven expression profile clusters, which illustrated the application of SMID and provided a fundamental resource to investigate the mechanism of MAT.
PXD029710	34928606	Nanodiamond Solid-Phase Extraction and Triton X-114 Cloud Point Separation for Robust Fractionation and Shotgun Proteomics Analysis of the Human Serum Proteome. 	Nanodiamond Solid Phase Extraction and Triton X-114 Cloud Point Separation for Robust Fractionation and Shotgun Proteomics Analysis of Human Serum Proteome	cloud point separation, fractionation, human serum, nanodiamond, prote-ome, proteomic analysis, solid phase extraction, triton X-114	Human serum is one of the most attractive specimens in biomarker research. However, its overcomplicated properties have hindered the analysis of low-abundance proteins by conventional mass spectrometry techniques. This work proposes an innovative strategy for utilizing nanodiamonds (NDs) in combination with Triton X-114 protein extraction to fractionate the crude serum to six pH-tuned fractions, simplifying the overall proteome and facilitating protein profiling with high efficiency. A total of 663 proteins are identified and evenly distributed among the fractions along with 39 FDA-approved biomarkers-a remarkable increase from the 230 proteins found in unfractionated crude serum. In the low-abundance protein section, 88 proteins with 7 FDA-approved biomarkers are detected-a marked increase from the 15 proteins (2 biomarkers) observed in the untreated sample. Notably, fractions at pH 11, derived from the aqueous phase of detergent separation, suggest potential applications in rapid and robust serum proteome analysis. Notably, by outlining the excellent properties of NDs for proteomic research, this work suggests a promising extraction protocol utilizing the great compatibility of NDs with streamlined serum proteomics and identifies potential avenues for future developments. Finally, we believe that this work not just improves shotgun proteomics but also opens up studies on the interaction between NDs and the human proteome. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD029710.
PXD018637	34929254	Scaffold polarity proteins Par3A and Par3B share redundant functions while Par3B acts independent of atypical protein kinase C/Par6 in podocytes to maintain the kidney filtration barrier. 	Par3A and Par3B interactome IMCDs	IMCD cells, Par3A, Par3B	Glomerular diseases are a major cause for chronic kidney disorders. In most cases podocyte injury is causative for disease development. Cytoskeletal rearrangements and morphological changes are hallmark features of podocyte injury and result in dedifferentiation and loss of podocytes. Here, we establish a link between the Par3 polarity complex and actin regulators necessary to establish and maintain podocyte architecture by utilizing mouse and Drosophila models to characterize the functional role of Par3A and Par3B and its fly homologue Bazooka in vivo. Only simultaneous inactivation of both Par3 proteins caused a severe disease phenotype. Rescue experiments in Drosophila nephrocytes revealed atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)-Par6 dependent and independent effects. While Par3A primarily acts via aPKC-Par6, Par3B function was independent of Par6. Actin-associated synaptopodin protein levels were found to be significantly upregulated upon loss of Par3A/B in mouse podocytes. Tropomyosin2, which shares functional similarities with synaptopodin, was also elevated in Bazooka depleted nephrocytes. The simultaneous depletion of Bazooka and Tropomyosin2 resulted in a partial rescue of the Bazooka knockdown phenotype and prevented increased Rho1-GTP, a member of a GTPase protein family regulating the cytoskeleton. The latter contribute to the nephrocyte phenotype observed upon loss of Bazooka. Thus, we demonstrate that Par3 proteins share a high functional redundancy but also have specific functions. Par3A acts in an aPKC-Par6 dependent way and regulates RhoA-GTP levels, while Par3B exploits Par6 independent functions influencing synaptopodin localization. Hence, Par3A and Par3B link elements of polarity signaling and actin regulators to maintain podocyte architecture.
PXD027213	34929720	Structural architecture of the human NALCN channelosome. 	Structural architecture and function of the human NALCN channelosome	Chemical cross-linking, DMTMM, DSS, NALCN, PDH, ion channel, sodium leak channel	Depolarizing sodium (Na(+)) leak currents carried by the NALCN channel regulate the resting membrane potential of many neurons to modulate respiration, circadian rhythm, locomotion and pain sensitivity(1-8). NALCN requires FAM155A, UNC79 and UNC80 to function, but the role of these auxiliary subunits is not understood(3,7,9-12). NALCN, UNC79 and UNC80 are essential in rodents(2,9,13), and mutations in human NALCN and UNC80 cause severe developmental and neurological disease(14,15). Here we determined the structure of the NALCN channelosome, an approximately 1-MDa complex, as fundamental aspects about the composition, assembly and gating of this channelosome remain obscure. UNC79 and UNC80 are massive HEAT-repeat proteins that form an intertwined anti-parallel superhelical assembly, which docks intracellularly onto the NALCN-FAM155A pore-forming subcomplex. Calmodulin copurifies bound to the carboxy-terminal domain of NALCN, identifying this region as a putative modulatory hub. Single-channel analyses uncovered a low open probability for the wild-type complex, highlighting the tightly closed S6 gate in the structure, and providing a basis to interpret the altered gating properties of disease-causing variants. Key constraints between the UNC79-UNC80 subcomplex and the NALCN DI-DII and DII-DIII linkers were identified, leading to a model of channelosome gating. Our results provide a structural blueprint to understand the physiology of the NALCN channelosome and a template for drug discovery to modulate the resting membrane potential.
PXD027086	34930932	MYCL promotes iPSC-like colony formation via MYC Box 0 and 2 domains. 	Differences in protein domains between c-MYC and L-MYC during cellular reprogramming	MYC, reprogramming	Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can differentiate into cells of the three germ layers and are promising cell sources for regenerative medicine therapies. However, current protocols generate hiPSCs with low efficiency, and the generated iPSCs have variable differentiation capacity among different clones. Our previous study reported that MYC proteins (c-MYC and MYCL) are essential for reprogramming and germline transmission but that MYCL can generate hiPSC colonies more efficiently than c-MYC. The molecular underpinnings for the different reprogramming efficiencies between c-MYC and MYCL, however, are unknown. In this study, we found that MYC Box 0 (MB0) and MB2, two functional domains conserved in the MYC protein family, contribute to the phenotypic differences and promote hiPSC generation in MYCL-induced reprogramming. Proteome analyses suggested that in MYCL-induced reprogramming, cell adhesion-related cytoskeletal proteins are regulated by the MB0 domain, while the MB2 domain regulates RNA processes. These findings provide a molecular explanation for why MYCL has higher reprogramming efficiency than c-MYC.
PXD027333	34931806	4-Deoxy-4-fluoro-GalNAz (4FGalNAz) Is a Metabolic Chemical Reporter of O-GlcNAc Modifications, Highlighting the Notable Substrate Flexibility of O-GlcNAc Transferase. 	4-deoxy-4-fluoro-GalNAz (4FGalNAz) is a metabolic chemical reporter of O-GlcNAc modifications, highlighting the notable substrate flexibility of O-GlcNAc transferase	O-GlcNAc, TMT	Bio-orthogonal chemistries have revolutionized many fields. For example, metabolic chemical reporters (MCRs) of glycosylation are analogues of monosaccharides that contain a bio-orthogonal functionality, such as azides or alkynes. MCRs are metabolically incorporated into glycoproteins by living systems, and bio-orthogonal reactions can be subsequently employed to install visualization and enrichment tags. Unfortunately, most MCRs are not selective for one class of glycosylation (e.g., N-linked vs O-linked), complicating the types of information that can be gleaned. We and others have successfully created MCRs that are selective for intracellular O-GlcNAc modification by altering the structure of the MCR and thus biasing it to certain metabolic pathways and/or O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Here, we attempt to do the same for the core GalNAc residue of mucin O-linked glycosylation. The most widely applied MCR for mucin O-linked glycosylation, GalNAz, can be enzymatically epimerized at the 4-hydroxyl to give GlcNAz. This results in a mixture of cell-surface and O-GlcNAc labeling. We reasoned that replacing the 4-hydroxyl of GalNAz with a fluorine would lock the stereochemistry of this position in place, causing the MCR to be more selective. After synthesis, we found that 4FGalNAz labels a variety of proteins in mammalian cells and does not perturb endogenous glycosylation pathways unlike 4FGalNAc. However, through subsequent proteomic and biochemical characterization, we found that 4FGalNAz does not widely label cell-surface glycoproteins but instead is primarily a substrate for OGT. Although these results are somewhat unexpected, they once again highlight the large substrate flexibility of OGT, with interesting and important implications for intracellular protein modification by a potential range of abiotic and native monosaccharides.
PXD026295	34932266	Evaluation of four phosphopeptide enrichment strategies for mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. 	Characterization of phosphopeptide enrichment strategy for mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis	TiO2, phos-tag, phosphorylation	Information about phosphorylation status can be used to prioritize and characterize biological processes in the cell. Various analytical strategies have been proposed to address the complexity of phosphorylation status and comprehensively identify phosphopeptides. In this study, we evaluated four strategies for phosphopeptide enrichment, using titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) and Phos-tag ligand particles from in-gel or in-solution digests prior to mass spectrometry-based analysis. Using TiO2 and Phos-tag magnetic beads, it was possible to enrich phosphopeptides from in-gel digests of phosphorylated ovalbumin separated by Phos-tag SDS-PAGE or in-solution serum digests, while minimizing non-specific adsorption. The tip-column strategy with TiO2 particles enabled enrichment of phosphopeptides from in-solution digests of whole-cell lysates with high efficiency and selectivity. However, the tip-column strategy with Phos-tag agarose beads yielded the greatest number of identified phosphopeptides. The strategies using both types of tip columns had a high degree of overlap, although there were differences in selectivity between the identified phosphopeptides. Together, our results indicate that multi-enrichment strategies using TiO2 particles and Phos-tag agarose beads are useful for comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis.
PXD026184	34932366	HLA Allele-Specific Quantitative Profiling of Type 1 Diabetic B Lymphocyte Immunopeptidome. 	T1D B lymphocyte cell line Immunopeptidome	B cell, HLA-I, HLA-II, T1D, allele, immunopeptidome	Peptide ligands presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules on the cell surface represent the immunopeptidome that could be utilized for identification of antigenic peptides for immunotherapy and prevention of autoimmune diseases. Although T-cells are well-known key players in the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D), increasing evidence points toward a role for B-cells in disease pathogenesis. However, as antigen presenting cells, little is known about the comprehensive immunopeptidome of B cells and their changes in the context of T1D. We performed HLA allele-specific quantitative immunopeptidomics using B lymphocytes derived from T1D patients and healthy controls. Hundreds of HLA-I and HLA-II immunopeptides were identified as differentially regulated in T1D per HLA allele for B cells sharing identical HLA alleles. The results were further validated using additional T1D and healthy B cells with partially overlapped HLA alleles. Differentially expressed immunopeptides were confirmed with targeted proteomics and for reactivity using known T-cell assays in the immune epitope database. Considering samples with identical HLA alleles are difficult to obtain for T1D and other similar HLA-restricted diseases, our work represents a viable approach to better understand HLA allele-specific antigen presentation and may facilitate identification of immunopeptides for therapeutic applications in autoimmune diseases. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026184.
PXD023806	34932872	Comprehensive kinomic study via a chemical proteomic approach reveals kinome reprogramming in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. 	Comprehensive kinomic study via a chemical proteomic approach reveals dynamic kinome reprogramming in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues	Hepatocellular carcinoma, chemical proteomics, kinomic study	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Kinases are attractive therapeutic targets since they are commonly altered in cancers. Here, to identify kinases of potential therapeutic interest in HCC, a quantitative kinomic study of tumour and adjacent non-tumour liver tissues was performed using a chemical proteomics approach. In total, 124 kinases were found differentially expressed and they were distributed over all nine kinase groups. Exploration of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data showed that the dysregulation of 45 kinases was correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. We then tested 11 inhibitors targeting 12 crucial protein kinases alone or in combination for their ability to inhibit cell growth in Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 cell lines. Six inhibitors significantly reduced viability in both cell lines. Combination inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and casein kinase 1 epsilon (CSNK1E) significantly induced growth arrest in both cell lines synergistically. In summary, our analysis presents the most complete view of kinome reprogramming in HCC and provides novel insight into crucial kinases in HCC and potential therapeutic targets for HCC treatment. Moreover, the identification of hundreds of differentially expressed kinases forms a rich resource for novel drug targets or diagnostic biomarker discovery. Data are available via ProteomeXchange (identifier PXD023806).
PXD029069	34934154	Metallothionein immunohistochemistry has high sensitivity and specificity for detection of Wilson disease. 	Metallothionein immunohistochemistry has high sensitivity and specificity for detection of Wilson disease	Immunohistochemistry, MT1G, Metallothionein-1G, Quantitative proteomics, Sensitivity, Specificity, Wilson disease, liver	Diagnosis of Wilson disease (WD) can be difficult because of its protean clinical presentations, but early diagnosis is important because effective treatment is available and can prevent disease progression. Similarly, diagnosis of WD on liver biopsy specimens is difficult due to the wide range of histologic appearances. A stain that could help identify WD patients would be of great value. The goal of this study was to use mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify potential proteins that are differentially expressed in WD compared to controls, and could serve as potential immunohistochemical markers for screening. Several proteins were differentially expressed in WD and immunohistochemical stains for two (metallothionein (MT) and cytochrome C oxidase copper chaperone (COX17)) were tested and compared to other methods of diagnosis in WD including copper staining and quantitative copper assays. We found diffuse metallothionein immunoreactivity in all liver specimens from patients with WD (n = 20); the intensity of the staining was moderate to strong. This staining pattern was distinct from that seen in specimens from the control groups (none of which showed strong, diffuse staining), which included diseases that may be in the clinical or histologic differential of WD (steatohepatitis (n = 51), chronic viral hepatitis (n = 40), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 50), chronic biliary tract disease (n = 42), and normal liver (n = 20)). COX17 immunostain showed no significant difference in expression between the WD and control groups. MT had higher sensitivity than rhodanine for diagnosis of WD. While the quantitative liver copper assays also had high sensitivity, they require more tissue, have a higher cost, longer turnaround time, and are less widely available than an immunohistochemical stain. We conclude that MT IHC is a sensitive immunohistochemical stain for the diagnosis of WD that could be widely deployed as a screening tool for liver biopsies in which WD is in the clinical or histologic differential diagnosis.
PXD028125	34934174	A specific inhibitor of ALDH1A3 regulates retinoic acid biosynthesis in glioma stem cells. 	A specific inhibitor of ALDH1A3 regulates retinoic acid biosynthesis in glioma stem cells	Human Proteome Project, ProteomeXchange project tag: Cancer (B/D-HPP), Target-ID, cancer, small molecule	Elevated aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity correlates with poor outcome for many solid tumors as ALDHs may regulate cell proliferation and chemoresistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Accordingly, potent, and selective inhibitors of key ALDH enzymes may represent a novel CSC-directed treatment paradigm for ALDH(+) cancer types. Of the many ALDH isoforms, we and others have implicated the elevated expression of ALDH1A3 in mesenchymal glioma stem cells (MES GSCs) as a target for the development of novel therapeutics. To this end, our structure of human ALDH1A3 combined with in silico modeling identifies a selective, active-site inhibitor of ALDH1A3. The lead compound, MCI-INI-3, is a selective competitive inhibitor of human ALDH1A3 and shows poor inhibitory effect on the structurally related isoform ALDH1A1. Mass spectrometry-based cellular thermal shift analysis reveals that ALDH1A3 is the primary binding protein for MCI-INI-3 in MES GSC lysates. The inhibitory effect of MCI-INI-3 on retinoic acid biosynthesis is comparable with that of ALDH1A3 knockout, suggesting that effective inhibition of ALDH1A3 is achieved with MCI-INI-3. Further development is warranted to characterize the role of ALDH1A3 and retinoic acid biosynthesis in glioma stem cell growth and differentiation.
PXD029648	34934928	Hydroxychloroquine inhibits the mitochondrial antioxidant system in activated T cells. 	Class II Immunopeptidome of 9033 cells	9033, HCQ, HLA, class II, immunopeptidomics	Although hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has long been used to treat autoimmune diseases, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. In CD4 T-cells, we found that a clinically relevant concentration of HCQ inhibited the mitochondrial antioxidant system triggered by TCR crosslinking, leading to increased mitochondrial superoxide, impaired activation-induced autophagic flux, and reduced proliferation of CD4 T-cells. In antigen-presenting cells, HCQ also reduced constitutive activation of the endo-lysosomal protease legumain and toll-like receptor 9, thereby reducing cytokine production, but it had little apparent impact on constitutive antigen processing and peptide presentation. HCQ's effects did not require endo-lysosomal pH change, nor impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion. We explored the clinical relevance of these findings in patients with celiac disease-a prototypic CD4 T-cell-mediated disease-and found that HCQ limits ex vivo antigen-specific T cell responses. We report a T-cell-intrinsic immunomodulatory effect from HCQ and suggest potential re-purposing of HCQ for celiac disease.
PXD029427	34935159	Caldendrin and myosin V regulate synaptic spine apparatus localization via ER stabilization in dendritic spines. 	Caldendrin regulates spine apparatus localization through myosin V-dependent ER-stabilization in dendritic spines	Caldendrin, V-dependent ER-stabilization, dendritic spines, myosin, spine apparatus	Excitatory synapses of principal hippocampal neurons are frequently located on dendritic spines. The dynamic strengthening or weakening of individual inputs results in structural and molecular diversity of dendritic spines. Active spines with large calcium ion (Ca(2+) ) transients are frequently invaded by a single protrusion from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is dynamically transported into spines via the actin-based motor myosin V. An increase in synaptic strength correlates with stable anchoring of the ER, followed by the formation of an organelle referred to as the spine apparatus. Here, we show that myosin V binds the Ca(2+) sensor caldendrin, a brain-specific homolog of the well-known myosin V interactor calmodulin. While calmodulin is an essential activator of myosin V motor function, we found that caldendrin acts as an inhibitor of processive myosin V movement. In mouse and rat hippocampal neurons, caldendrin regulates spine apparatus localization to a subset of dendritic spines through a myosin V-dependent pathway. We propose that caldendrin transforms myosin into a stationary F-actin tether that enables the localization of ER tubules and formation of the spine apparatus in dendritic spines.

Laser capture microdissection-capillary zone electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (LCM-CZE-MS/MS) for spatially resolved top-down proteomics: a pilot study of zebrafish brain	capillary zone electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry, high sensitivity, laser capture microdissection, motor activity, neuropeptide hormone activity, proteoform, spatially resolved top-down proteomics, zebrafish brain	Mass spectrometry (MS)-based spatially resolved top-down proteomics (TDP) of tissues is crucial for understanding the roles played by microenvironmental heterogeneity in the biological functions of organs and for discovering new proteoform biomarkers of diseases. There are few published spatially resolved TDP studies. One of the challenges relates to the limited performance of TDP for the analysis of spatially isolated samples using, for example, laser capture microdissection (LCM) because those samples are usually mass-limited. We present the first pilot study of LCM-capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)-MS/MS for spatially resolved TDP and used zebrafish brain as the sample. The LCM-CZE-MS/MS platform employed a non-ionic detergent and a freeze-thaw method for efficient proteoform extraction from LCM isolated brain sections followed by CZE-MS/MS without any sample cleanup step, ensuring high sensitivity. Over 400 proteoforms were identified in a CZE-MS/MS analysis of one LCM brain section via consuming the protein content of roughly 250 cells. We observed drastic differences in proteoform profiles between two LCM brain sections isolated from the optic tectum (Teo) and telencephalon (Tel) regions. Proteoforms of three proteins (npy, penkb, and pyya) having neuropeptide hormone activity were exclusively identified in the isolated Tel section. Proteoforms of reticulon, myosin, and troponin were almost exclusively identified in the isolated Teo section, and those proteins play essential roles in visual and motor activities. The proteoform profiles accurately reflected the main biological functions of the Teo and Tel regions of the brain. Additionally, hundreds of post-translationally modified proteoforms were identified.
PXD020487	34936021	HIV-infection and cocaine use regulate semen extracellular vesicles proteome and miRNAome in a manner that mediates strategic monocyte haptotaxis governed by miR-128 network. 	Proteomics of Human Blood and Semen Exosomes: Set 2	Blood, Exosomes, Semen	BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are regulators of cell-cell interactions and mediators of horizontal transfer of bioactive molecules between cells. EV-mediated cell-cell interactions play roles in physiological and pathophysiological processes, which maybe modulated by exposure to pathogens and cocaine use. However, the effect of pathogens and cocaine use on EV composition and function are not fully understood. RESULTS: Here, we used systems biology and multi-omics analysis to show that HIV infection (HIV +) and cocaine (COC) use (COC +) promote the release of semen-derived EVs (SEV) with dysregulated extracellular proteome (exProtein), miRNAome (exmiR), and exmiR networks. Integrating SEV proteome and miRNAome revealed a significant decrease in the enrichment of disease-associated, brain-enriched, and HIV-associated miR-128-3p (miR-128) in HIV + COC + SEV with a concomitant increase in miR-128 targets-PEAK1 and RND3/RhoE. Using two-dimensional-substrate single cell haptotaxis, we observed that in the presence of HIV + COC + SEV, contact guidance provided by the extracellular matrix (ECM, collagen type 1) network facilitated far-ranging haptotactic cues that guided monocytes over longer distances. Functionalizing SEV with a miR-128 mimic revealed that the strategic changes in monocyte haptotaxis are in large part the result of SEV-associated miR-128. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that compositionally and functionally distinct HIV + COC + and HIV-COC- SEVs and their exmiR networks may provide cells relevant but divergent haptotactic guidance in the absence of chemotactic cues, under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
PXD024286	34936701	Distinct subcellular autophagy impairments in induced neurons from patients with Huntington's disease. 	Distinct sub-cellular autophagy impairments occur independently of protein aggregation in aged induced neurons from patients with Huntington's disease	CRISPR interference, Huntington disease, Proteogenomics, autophagy, direct neural reprogramming, lentiviral vector	Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG expansions in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Modelling Huntington's disease is challenging, as rodent and cellular models poorly recapitulate the disease as seen in ageing humans. To address this, we generated induced neurons through direct reprogramming of human skin fibroblasts, which retain age-dependent epigenetic characteristics. Huntington's disease induced neurons (HD-iNs) displayed profound deficits in autophagy, characterized by reduced transport of late autophagic structures from the neurites to the soma. These neurite-specific alterations in autophagy resulted in shorter, thinner and fewer neurites specifically in HD-iNs. CRISPRi-mediated silencing of HTT did not rescue this phenotype but rather resulted in additional autophagy alterations in control induced neurons, highlighting the importance of wild-type HTT in normal neuronal autophagy. In summary, our work identifies a distinct subcellular autophagy impairment in adult patient derived Huntington's disease neurons and provides a new rationale for future development of autophagy activation therapies.
PXD026559	34936728	METTL1-m(7) G-EGFR/EFEMP1 axis promotes the bladder cancer development. 	Proteomics analysis LC-MS/MS of human bladder cancer cells	bladder	BACKGROUND: The posttranscriptional modifications of transfer RNA (tRNA) are critical for all aspects of the tRNA function and have been implicated in the tumourigenesis and progression of many human cancers. By contrast, the biological functions of methyltransferase-like 1 (METTL1)-regulated m(7) G tRNA modification in bladder cancer (BC) remain obscure. RESULTS: In this research, we show that METTL1 was highly expressed in BC, and its level was correlated with poor patient prognosis. Silencing METTL1 suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of BC cells in vitro and in vivo. Multi-omics analysis reveals that METTL1-mediated m(7) G tRNA modification altered expression of certain target genes, including EGFR/EFEMP1. Mechanistically, METTL1 regulates the translation of EGFR/EFEMP1 via modifying certain tRNAs. Furthermore, forced expression of EGFR/EFEMP1 partially rescues the effect of METTL1 deletion on BC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the oncogenic role of METTL1 and the pathological significance of the METTL1-m(7) G-EGFR/EFEMP1 axis in the BC development, thus providing potential therapeutic targets for the BC treatment.
PXD027664	34939086	N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidases mediate the generation of paucimannosidic proteins via a putative noncanonical truncation pathway in human neutrophils. 	N-Acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidases mediate the generation of paucimannosidic proteins via a putative non-canonical truncation pathway in human neutrophils	Glycoproteomics (B/D-HPP), Human Proteome Project, N-Acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase, ProteomeXchange project tag: Biology/Disease-Driven Human Proteome Project (B/D-HPP), biosynthesis, neutrophil, paucimannose, truncation	We recently discovered that human neutrophils express immunomodulatory glycoproteins carrying unusual and highly truncated paucimannosidic N-glycans (Man1-3GlcNAc2Fuc0-1), but their biosynthesis remains elusive. Guided by the well-characterized truncation pathway in invertebrates and plants in which the N-acetyl-beta-D-hexosaminidase (Hex) isoenzymes catalyze paucimannosidic protein (PMP) formation, we here set out to test if the homologous human Hex alpha and beta subunits encoded by HEXA and HEXB drive a similar truncation pathway in human neutrophils. To this end, we performed quantitative glycomics and glycoproteomics of several CRISPR-Cas9-edited Hex-disrupted neutrophil-like HL-60 mutants (HEXA-KO and HEXB-KO) and matching unedited cell lines. Hex disruption was validated using next-generation sequencing, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), quantitative proteomics and Hex activity assays. Excitingly, all Hex-disrupted mutants displayed significantly reduced levels of paucimannosylation, particularly Man2-3GlcNAc2Fuc1, relative to unedited HL-60 suggesting that both HEXA and HEXB contribute to PMP formation via a hitherto unexplored truncation pathway in neutrophils. Quantitative N-glycomics indeed demonstrated reduced utilization of a putative noncanonical truncation pathway in favor of the canonical elongation pathway in all Hex-disrupted mutants relative to unedited controls. Quantitative glycoproteomics recapitulated the truncation-to-elongation switch in all Hex-disrupted mutants and showed a greater switch for N-glycoproteins cotrafficking with Hex to the azurophilic granules of neutrophils such as myeloperoxidase. Finally, we supported the Hex-PMP relationship by documenting that primary neutrophils isolated from an early-onset Sandhoff disease patient (HEXB-/-) displayed dramatically reduced paucimannosylation relative to neutrophils from an age-matched unaffected donor. We conclude that both human Hex alpha and beta mediate PMP formation via a putative noncanonical truncation pathway in neutrophils.
PXD029420	34939118	Identification of alpha1,2-fucosylated signaling and adhesion molecules in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. 	Proteomic and Glycoproteomic Analyses of Fucosylated Glycoproteins in Head and Neck Cancer Cell Lines	FUT2, Fucosylation, HNSCC, Head and neck cancer, Lewis Y, oral cancer	Head and neck cancer is the seventh most common cancer in the world, and most cases manifest as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Despite the prominent role of fucosylated carbohydrate antigens in tumor cell adhesion and metastasis, little is known about the functional role of fucose-modified glycoproteins in head and neck cancer pathobiology. Inactivating polymorphisms of the fut2 gene, encoding for the alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase FUT2, are associated with an increased incidence of head and neck cancer among tobacco users. Moreover, the presence of the alpha1,2-fucosylated Lewis Y epitope, with both alpha1,2- and alpha1,3-linked fucose, has been observed in head and neck cancer tumors while invasive regions lose expression, suggesting a potential role for alpha1,2-fucosylation in the regulation of aggressive tumor cell characteristics. Here, we report an association between fut2 expression and head and neck cancer survival, document differential surface expression of alpha1,2-fucosylated epitopes in a panel of normal, dysplastic, and head and neck cancer cell lines, identify a set of potentially alpha1,2-fucosylated signaling and adhesion molecules including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), CD44 and integrins via tandem mass spectrometry, and finally, present evidence that EGFR is among the alpha1,2-fucosylated and LeY-displaying proteins in head and neck cancer. This knowledge will serve as the foundation for future studies to interrogate the role of LeY-modified and alpha1,2-fucosylated glycoproteins in head and neck cancer pathogenesis. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD029420.
PXD027551	34940600	Integrated Metabolomics and Proteomics Dynamics of Serum Samples Reveals Dietary Zeolite Clinoptilolite Supplementation Restores Energy Balance in High Yielding Dairy Cows. 	Integrated metabolomics and proteomics dynamics of serum samples reveals dietary Zeolite clinoptilolite supplementation restores energy balance in high yielding dairy cows	Negative energy balance, cows, metabolomics, serum, zeolite clinoptilolite	Dairy cows can suffer from a negative energy balance (NEB) during their transition from the dry period to early lactation, which can increase the risk of postpartum diseases such as clinical ketosis, mastitis, and fatty liver. Zeolite clinoptilolite (CPL), due to its ion-exchange property, has often been used to treat NEB in animals. However, limited information is available on the dynamics of global metabolomics and proteomic profiles in serum that could provide a better understanding of the associated altered biological pathways in response to CPL. Thus, in the present study, a total 64 serum samples were collected from 8 control and 8 CPL-treated cows at different time points in the prepartum and postpartum stages. Labelled proteomics and untargeted metabolomics resulted in identification of 64 and 21 differentially expressed proteins and metabolites, respectively, which appear to play key roles in restoring energy balance (EB) after CPL supplementation. Joint pathway and interaction analysis revealed cross-talks among valproic acid, leucic acid, glycerol, fibronectin, and kinninogen-1, which could be responsible for restoring NEB. By using a global proteomics and metabolomics strategy, the present study concluded that CPL supplementation could lower NEB in just a few weeks, and explained the possible underlying pathways employed by CPL.
PXD024164	34942055	UDP-glucose dehydrogenase expression is upregulated following EMT and differentially affects intracellular glycerophosphocholine and acetylaspartate levels in breast mesenchymal cell lines. 	Proteomic analysis of breast EMT cell models reveal UGDH is upregulated during EMT and holds the potential as a clinical target	EMT, UGDH, biomarker, breast, cell model, upregulated	Metabolic rewiring is one of the indispensable drivers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) involved in breast cancer metastasis. In this study, we explored the metabolic changes during spontaneous EMT in three separately established breast EMT cell models using a proteomic approach supported by metabolomic analysis. We identified common proteomic changes, including the expression of CDH1, CDH2, VIM, LGALS1, SERPINE1, PKP3, ATP2A2, JUP, MTCH2, RPL26L1 and PLOD2. Consistently altered metabolic enzymes included the following: FDFT1, SORD, TSTA3 and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH). Of these, UGDH was most prominently altered and has previously been associated with breast cancer patient survival. siRNA-mediated knock-down of UGDH resulted in delayed cell proliferation and dampened invasive potential of mesenchymal cells and downregulated expression of the EMT transcription factor SNAI1. Metabolomic analysis revealed that siRNA-mediated knock-down of UGDH decreased intracellular glycerophosphocholine (GPC), whereas levels of acetylaspartate (NAA) increased. Finally, our data suggested that platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) signalling was activated in mesenchymal cells. siRNA-mediated knock-down of PDGFRB downregulated UGDH expression, potentially via NFkB-p65. Our results support an unexplored relationship between UGDH and GPC, both of which have previously been independently associated with breast cancer progression.
PXD016683	34942119	APC7 mediates ubiquitin signaling in constitutive heterochromatin in the developing mammalian brain. 	Proteomic analysis of APC7 KO mouse Cerebella	APC7, Cerebellum, TMT	Neurodevelopmental cognitive disorders provide insights into mechanisms of human brain development. Here, we report an intellectual disability syndrome caused by the loss of APC7, a core component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex (APC). In mechanistic studies, we uncover a critical role for APC7 during the recruitment and ubiquitination of APC substrates. In proteomics analyses of the brain from mice harboring the patient-specific APC7 mutation, we identify the chromatin-associated protein Ki-67 as an APC7-dependent substrate of the APC in neurons. Conditional knockout of the APC coactivator protein Cdh1, but not Cdc20, leads to the accumulation of Ki-67 protein in neurons in vivo, suggesting that APC7 is required for the function of Cdh1-APC in the brain. Deregulated neuronal Ki-67 upon APC7 loss localizes predominantly to constitutive heterochromatin. Our findings define an essential function for APC7 and Cdh1-APC in neuronal heterochromatin regulation, with implications for understanding human brain development and disease.
PXD027407	34942145	The thymus regulates skeletal muscle regeneration by directly promoting satellite cell expansion. 	Rat cell supernatant and the separation of supernatant LC-MSMS	cell supernatant, rat	The thymus is the central immune organ, but it is known to progressively degenerate with age. As thymus degeneration is paralleled by the wasting of aging skeletal muscle, we speculated that the thymus may play a role in muscle wasting. Here, using thymectomized mice, we show that the thymus is necessary for skeletal muscle regeneration, a process tightly associated with muscle aging. Compared to control mice, the thymectomized mice displayed comparable growth of muscle mass, but decreased muscle regeneration in response to injury, as evidenced by small and sparse regenerative myofibers along with inhibited expression of regeneration-associated genes myh3, myod, and myogenin. Using paired box 7 (Pax7)-immunofluorescence staining and 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-incorporation assay, we determined that the decreased regeneration capacity was caused by a limited satellite cell pool. Interestingly, the conditioned culture medium of isolated thymocytes had a potent capacity to directly stimulate satellite cell expansion in vitro. These expanded cells were enriched in subpopulations of quiescent satellite cells (Pax7(high)MyoD(low)EdU(pos)) and activated satellite cells (Pax7(high)MyoD(high)EdU(pos)), which were efficiently incorporated into the regenerative myofibers. We thus propose that the thymus plays an essential role in muscle regeneration by directly promoting satellite cell expansion and may function profoundly in the muscle aging process.
PXD026302	34942634	Evolution of enhanced innate immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2. 	Evolution of enhanced innate immune evasion by the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 UK variant	Covid-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Sars-cov-2, SARS-CoV-2, systems biology, variants, virus	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern suggests viral adaptation to enhance human-to-human transmission(1,2). Although much effort has focused on the characterization of changes in the spike protein in variants of concern, mutations outside of spike are likely to contribute to adaptation. Here, using unbiased abundance proteomics, phosphoproteomics, RNA sequencing and viral replication assays, we show that isolates of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant(3) suppress innate immune responses in airway epithelial cells more effectively than first-wave isolates. We found that the Alpha variant has markedly increased subgenomic RNA and protein levels of the nucleocapsid protein (N), Orf9b and Orf6-all known innate immune antagonists. Expression of Orf9b alone suppressed the innate immune response through interaction with TOM70, a mitochondrial protein that is required for activation of the RNA-sensing adaptor MAVS. Moreover, the activity of Orf9b and its association with TOM70 was regulated by phosphorylation. We propose that more effective innate immune suppression, through enhanced expression of specific viral antagonist proteins, increases the likelihood of successful transmission of the Alpha variant, and may increase in vivo replication and duration of infection(4). The importance of mutations outside the spike coding region in the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans is underscored by the observation that similar mutations exist in the N and Orf9b regulatory regions of the Delta and Omicron variants.
PXD028781	34943148	Characterization of a MOB1 Homolog in the Apicomplexan Parasite Toxoplasma gondii. 	Toxoplasma gondii MOB1 interactome	BioID, Hippo pathway, MOB1, Mitotic exit network, Toxoplasma gondii, nanoLC-MS/MS, proximity biotinylation	Monopolar spindle One Binder1 (MOB1) proteins are conserved components of the tumor-suppressing Hippo pathway, regulating cellular processes such as cytokinesis. Apicomplexan parasites present a life cycle that relies on the parasites' ability to differentiate between stages and regulate their proliferation; thus, Hippo signaling pathways could play an important role in the regulation of the apicomplexan life cycle. Here, we report the identification of one MOB1 protein in the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. To characterize the function of MOB1, we generated gain-of-function transgenic lines with a ligand-controlled destabilization domain, and loss-of-function clonal lines obtained through CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Contrary to what has been characterized in other eukaryotes, MOB1 is not essential for cytokinesis in T. gondii. However, this picture is complex since we found MOB1 localized between the newly individualized daughter nuclei at the end of mitosis. Moreover, we detected a significant delay in the replication of overexpressing tachyzoites, contrasting with increased replication rates in knockout tachyzoites. Finally, using the proximity-biotinylation method, BioID, we identified novel members of the MOB1 interactome, a probable consequence of the observed lack of conservation of some key amino acid residues. Altogether, the results point to a complex evolutionary history of MOB1 roles in apicomplexans, sharing properties with other eukaryotes but also with divergent features, possibly associated with their complex life cycle.
PXD029352	34943827	Aging of Podospora anserina Leads to Alterations of OXPHOS and the Induction of Non-Mitochondrial Salvage Pathways. 	Complexome profiling of mitochondria to study organismic consequences of aging in Podospora anserina	Podospora anserina, aging, complexome profiling, mitochondria, oxidative phosphorylation system	The accumulation of functionally impaired mitochondria is a key event in aging. Previous works with the fungal aging model Podospora anserina demonstrated pronounced age-dependent changes of mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure, as well as alterations of transcript and protein levels, including individual proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The identified protein changes do not reflect the level of the whole protein complexes as they function in-vivo. In the present study, we investigated in detail the age-dependent changes of assembled mitochondrial protein complexes, using complexome profiling. We observed pronounced age-depen-dent alterations of the OXPHOS complexes, including the loss of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes (mtRSCs) and a reduction in the abundance of complex I and complex IV. Additionally, we identified a switch from the standard complex IV-dependent respiration to an alternative respiration during the aging of the P. anserina wild type. Interestingly, we identified proteasome components, as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins, for which the recruitment to mitochondria appeared to be increased in the mitochondria of older cultures. Overall, our data demonstrate pronounced age-dependent alterations of the protein complexes involved in energy transduction and suggest the induction of different non-mitochondrial salvage pathways, to counteract the age-dependent mitochondrial impairments which occur during aging.
PXD029418	34943861	Inactivity of Peptidase ClpP Causes Primary Accumulation of Mitochondrial Disaggregase ClpX with Its Interacting Nucleoid Proteins, and of mtDNA. 	Inactivity of peptidase ClpP causes primary accumulation  of mitochondrial disaggregase ClpX with its interactors  at the nucleoid and RNA granule	Ataxia, ClpB, ERAL1, HARS2, LARS2, Leukodystrophy, Parkinson's disease, TWNK	Biallelic pathogenic variants in CLPP, encoding mitochondrial matrix peptidase ClpP, cause a rare autosomal recessive condition, Perrault syndrome type 3 (PRLTS3). It is characterized by primary ovarian insufficiency and early sensorineural hearing loss, often associated with progressive neurological deficits. Mouse models showed that accumulations of (i) its main protein interactor, the substrate-selecting AAA+ ATPase ClpX, (ii) mitoribosomes, and (iii) mtDNA nucleoids are the main cellular consequences of ClpP absence. However, the sequence of these events and their validity in human remain unclear. Here, we studied global proteome profiles to define ClpP substrates among mitochondrial ClpX interactors, which accumulated consistently in ClpP-null mouse embryonal fibroblasts and brains. Validation work included novel ClpP-mutant patient fibroblast proteomics. ClpX co-accumulated in mitochondria with the nucleoid component POLDIP2, the mitochondrial poly(A) mRNA granule element LRPPRC, and tRNA processing factor GFM1 (in mouse, also GRSF1). Only in mouse did accumulated ClpX, GFM1, and GRSF1 appear in nuclear fractions. Mitoribosomal accumulation was minor. Consistent accumulations in murine and human fibroblasts also affected multimerizing factors not known as ClpX interactors, namely, OAT, ASS1, ACADVL, STOM, PRDX3, PC, MUT, ALDH2, PMPCB, UQCRC2, and ACADSB, but the impact on downstream metabolites was marginal. Our data demonstrate the primary impact of ClpXP on the assembly of proteins with nucleic acids and show nucleoid enlargement in human as a key consequence.
PXD029012	34943907	Overexpression of Neuroglobin Promotes Energy Metabolism and Autophagy Induction in Human Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cells. 	The proteome of neuroglobin-overexpressing SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells	NGB, Neuroglobin, S-Trap, label-free proteomics	Neuroglobin (NGB) is an O2-binding globin mainly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and cerebrospinal fluid. Previously, it was demonstrated that NGB overexpression protects cells from hypoxia-induced death. To investigate processes promoted by NGB overexpression, we used a cellular model of neuroblastoma stably overexpressing an NGB-FLAG construct. We used a proteomic approach to identify the specific profile following NGB overexpression. To evaluate the role of NGB overexpression in increasing energetic metabolism, we measured oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate through Seahorse XF technology. The effect on autophagy induction was evaluated by analyzing SQSTM1/p62 and LC3-II expression. Proteomic analysis revealed several differentially regulated proteins, involved in oxidative phosphorylation and integral mitochondrial proteins linked to energy metabolism. The analysis of mitochondrial metabolism demonstrated that NGB overexpression increases mitochondrial ATP production. Indeed, NGB overexpression enhances bioenergetic metabolism, increasing OCR and oxygen consumption. Analysis of autophagy induction revealed an increase of LC3-II together with a significant decrease of SQSTM1/p62, and NGB-LC3-II association during autophagosome formation. These results highlight the active participation of NGB in several cellular processes that can be upregulated in response to NGB overexpression, playing a role in the adaptive response to stress in neuroblastoma cells.
PXD025376	34943915	Phosphoproteomics Sample Preparation Impacts Biological Interpretation of Phosphorylation Signaling Outcomes. 	Phosphoproteomics sample preparation impacts biological interpretation of signalling responses	Comparative analysis, HighPhos, Phosphoproteomics, SCXPhos, TiO2, high-throughput phosphoproteomics, sample preparation	The influence of phosphoproteomics sample preparation methods on the biological interpretation of signaling outcome is unclear. Here, we demonstrate a strong bias in phosphorylation signaling targets uncovered by comparing the phosphoproteomes generated by two commonly used methods-strong cation exchange chromatography-based phosphoproteomics (SCXPhos) and single-run high-throughput phosphoproteomics (HighPhos). Phosphoproteomes of embryonic stem cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) profiled by both methods achieved equivalent coverage (around 20,000 phosphosites), whereas a combined dataset significantly increased the depth (>30,000 phosphosites). While both methods reproducibly quantified a subset of shared IR-responsive phosphosites that represent DNA damage and cell-cycle-related signaling events, most IR-responsive phosphoproteins (>82%) and phosphosites (>96%) were method-specific. Both methods uncovered unique insights into phospho-signaling mediated by single (SCXPhos) versus double/multi-site (HighPhos) phosphorylation events; particularly, each method identified a distinct set of previously unreported IR-responsive kinome/phosphatome (95% disparate) directly impacting the uncovered biology.
PXD029672	34944015	Structural Alternation in Heat Shock Proteins of Activated Macrophages. 	Structural Alternation in Heat Shock Proteins of Activated Macrophages	HSP60, LPS, Lip-MS, RAW264.7, Structural proteomics	The inflammatory response of macrophages is an orderly and complex process under strict regulation accompanied by drastic changes in morphology and functions. It is predicted that proteins will undergo structural changes during these finely regulated processes. However, changes in structural proteome in macrophages during the inflammatory response remain poorly characterized. In the present study, we applied limited proteolysis coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) to identify proteome-wide structural changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages. We identified 386 structure-specific proteolytic fingerprints from 230 proteins. Using the Gene Ontology (GO) biological process enrichment, we discovered that proteins with altered structures were enriched into protein folding-related terms, in which HSP60 was ranked as the most changed protein. We verified the structural changes in HSP60 by using cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and native CETSA. Our results showed that the thermal stability of HSP60 was enhanced in activated macrophages and formed an HSP10-less complex. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in situ structural systems biology is an effective method to characterize proteomic structural changes and reveal that the structures of chaperone proteins vary significantly during macrophage activation.
PXD026916	34944072	Differences in Cell-Intrinsic Inflammatory Programs of Yolk Sac and Bone Marrow Macrophages. 	LC-MS/MS of differentiated bone marrow and Yolk sac macrophages	Hoxb8, Yolk sac, bone marrow, macrophages	BACKGROUND: Tissue-resident macrophages have mixed developmental origins. They derive in variable extent from yolk sac (YS) hematopoiesis during embryonic development. Bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic progenitors give rise to tissue macrophages in postnatal life, and their contribution increases upon organ injury. Since the phenotype and functions of macrophages are modulated by the tissue of residence, the impact of their origin and developmental paths has remained incompletely understood. METHODS: In order to decipher cell-intrinsic macrophage programs, we immortalized hematopoietic progenitors from YS and BM using conditional HoxB8, and carried out an in-depth functional and molecular analysis of differentiated macrophages. RESULTS: While YS and BM macrophages demonstrate close similarities in terms of cellular growth, differentiation, cell death susceptibility and phagocytic properties, they display differences in cell metabolism, expression of inflammatory markers and inflammasome activation. Reduced abundance of PYCARD (ASC) and CASPASE-1 proteins in YS macrophages abrogated interleukin-1beta production in response to canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation. CONCLUSIONS: Macrophage ontogeny is associated with distinct cellular programs and immune response. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the regulation and programming of macrophage functions.
PXD003939	34944421	Deepening into Intracellular Signaling Landscape through Integrative Spatial Proteomics and Transcriptomics in a Lymphoma Model. 	Subcellular fractionation in Ramos B-cells	B-cells, Ramos, subfractionation	Human Proteome Project (HPP) presents a systematic characterization of the protein landscape under different conditions using several complementary-omic techniques (LC-MS/MS proteomics, affinity proteomics, transcriptomics, etc.). In the present study, using a B-cell lymphoma cell line as a model, comprehensive integration of RNA-Seq transcriptomics, MS/MS, and antibody-based affinity proteomics (combined with size-exclusion chromatography) (SEC-MAP) were performed to uncover correlations that could provide insights into protein dynamics at the intracellular level. Here, 5672 unique proteins were systematically identified by MS/MS analysis and subcellular protein extraction strategies (neXtProt release 2020-21, MS/MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003939). Moreover, RNA deep sequencing analysis of this lymphoma B-cell line identified 19,518 expressed genes and 5707 protein coding genes (mapped to neXtProt). Among these data sets, 162 relevant proteins (targeted by 206 antibodies) were systematically analyzed by the SEC-MAP approach, providing information about PTMs, isoforms, protein complexes, and subcellular localization. Finally, a bioinformatic pipeline has been designed and developed for orthogonal integration of these high-content proteomics and transcriptomics datasets, which might be useful for comprehensive and global characterization of intracellular protein profiles.
PXD029980	34944635	Comparative Proteomic Analysis of tPVAT during Ang II Infusion. 	Mice tPVAT proteome profiling using high-throughput comparative proteomic analysis based on TMT labeling	Ang II, Mice, tPVAT	Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) homeostasis plays an important role in maintaining vascular function, and PVAT dysfunction may induce several pathophysiological situations. In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of the local angiotensin II (Ang II) on PVAT. High-throughput comparative proteomic analysis, based on TMT labeling combined with LC-MS/MS, were performed on an in vivo Ang II infusion mice model to obtain a comprehensive view of the protein ensembles associated with thoracic PVAT (tPVAT) dysfunction induced by Ang II. In total, 5037 proteins were confidently identified, of which 4984 proteins were quantified. Compared with the saline group, 145 proteins were upregulated and 146 proteins were downregulated during Ang II-induced tPVAT pathogenesis. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the most enriched GO terms were annotated as gene silencing, monosaccharide binding, and extracellular matrix. In addition, some novel proteins, potentially associated with Ang II infusion, were identified, such as acyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSVL), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), perilipin, RAS protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 2 (RasGRF2), and hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). Ang II could directly participate in the regulation of lipid metabolism, transportation, and adipocyte differentiation by affecting UCP1 and perilipin. Importantly, the key KEGG pathways were involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, FABP3-PPARalpha/gamma, RasGRF2-ERK-HIF-1alpha, RasGRF2-PKC-HIF-1alpha, and STAT3-HIF-1alpha axis. The present study provided the most comprehensive proteome profile of mice tPVAT and some novel insights into Ang II-mediated tPVAT dysfunction and will be helpful for understanding the possible relationship between local RAS activation and PVAT dysfunction.

Plasma proteome signature to predict outcome of breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy	Breast Cancer, Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy, Pathological Complete Response, Plasma	The plasma proteome of 51 non-metastatic breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) was prospectively analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with nano-flow liquid chromatography using blood drawn at the time of diagnosis. Plasma proteins were identified as potential biomarkers, and their correlation with clinicopathological variables and survival outcomes was analyzed. Of 51 patients, 20 (39.2%) were HR+/HER2-, five (9.8%) were HR+/HER2+, five (9.8%) were HER2+, and 21 (41.2%) were triple-negative subtype. During a median follow-up of 52.0 months, there were 15 relapses (29.4%) and eight deaths (15.7%). Four potential biomarkers were identified among differentially expressed proteins: APOC3 had higher plasma concentrations in the pathological complete response (pCR) group, whereas MBL2, ENG, and P4HB were higher in the non-pCR group. Proteins statistically significantly associated with survival and capable of differentiating low- and high-risk groups were MBL2 and P4HB for disease-free survival, P4HB for overall survival, and MBL2 for distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). In the multivariate analysis, only MBL2 was a consistent risk factor for DMFS (HR: 9.65, 95% CI 2.10-44.31). The results demonstrate that the proteomes from non-invasive sampling correlate with pCR and survival in breast cancer patients receiving NCT. Further investigation may clarify the role of these proteins in predicting prognosis and thus their therapeutic potential for the prevention of recurrence.
PXD030404	34944947	Comprehensive Profiling of Mammalian Tribbles Interactomes Implicates TRIB3 in Gene Repression. 	Comprehensive Profiling of Mammalian Tribbles Interactomes Implicates TRIB3 in Gene Repression	Tribbles, breast cancer, interactome	The three human Tribbles (TRIB) pseudokinases have been implicated in a plethora of signaling and metabolic processes linked to cancer initiation and progression and can potentially be used as biomarkers of disease and prognosis. While their modes of action reported so far center around protein-protein interactions, the comprehensive profiling of TRIB interactomes has not been reported yet. Here, we have developed a robust mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics approach to characterize Tribbles' interactomes and report a comprehensive assessment and comparison of the TRIB1, -2 and -3 interactomes, as well as domain-specific interactions for TRIB3. Interestingly, TRIB3, which is predominantly localized in the nucleus, interacts with multiple transcriptional regulators, including proteins involved in gene repression. Indeed, we found that TRIB3 repressed gene transcription when tethered to DNA in breast cancer cells. Taken together, our comprehensive proteomic assessment reveals previously unknown interacting partners and functions of Tribbles proteins that expand our understanding of this family of proteins. In addition, our findings show that MS-based proteomics provides a powerful tool to unravel novel pseudokinase biology.
PXD029417	34944965	SHED-Dependent Oncogenic Signaling of the PEAK3 Pseudo-Kinase. 	Interactomic analysis of PEAK3 pseudo-kinase	Pseudo-kinase, adhesive protein, oncogene, signalling protein	The PEAK1 and Pragmin/PEAK2 pseudo-kinases have emerged as important components of the protein tyrosine kinase pathway implicated in cancer progression. They can signal using a scaffolding mechanism that involves a conserved split helical dimerization (SHED) module. We recently identified PEAK3 as a novel member of this family based on structural homology; however, its signaling mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we found that, although it can self-associate, PEAK3 shows higher evolutionary divergence than PEAK1/2. Moreover, the PEAK3 protein is strongly expressed in human hematopoietic cells and is upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia. Functionally, PEAK3 overexpression in U2OS sarcoma cells enhanced their growth and migratory properties, while its silencing in THP1 leukemic cells reduced these effects. Importantly, an intact SHED module was required for these PEAK3 oncogenic activities. Mechanistically, through a phosphokinase survey, we identified PEAK3 as a novel inducer of AKT signaling, independent of growth-factor stimulation. Then, proteomic analyses revealed that PEAK3 interacts with the signaling proteins GRB2 and ASAP1/2 and the protein kinase PYK2, and that these interactions require the SHED domain. Moreover, PEAK3 activated PYK2, which promoted PEAK3 tyrosine phosphorylation, its association with GRB2 and ASAP1, and AKT signaling. Thus, the PEAK1-3 pseudo-kinases may use a conserved SHED-dependent mechanism to activate specific signaling proteins to promote oncogenesis.
PXD017373	34946222	Diel Protein Regulation of Marine Picoplanktonic Communities Assessed by Metaproteomics. 	Diel Protein Regulation of Marine Picoplanktonic Communities Assessed by Metaproteomics	Diel cycle, Marine Microbial Ecology, Metaproteomics, Picoplankton Communities	The diel cycle is of enormous biological importance in that it imposes temporal structure on ecosystem productivity. In the world's oceans, microorganisms form complex communities that carry out about half of photosynthesis and the bulk of life-sustaining nutrient cycling. How the functioning of microbial communities is impacted by day and night periods in surface seawater remains to be elucidated. In this study, we compared the day and night metaproteomes of the free-living and the particle-attached bacterial fractions from picoplanktonic communities sampled from the northwest Mediterranean Sea surface. Our results showed similar taxonomic distribution of free-living and particle-attached bacterial populations, with Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria being the most active members. Comparison of the day and night metaproteomes revealed that free-living and particle-attached bacteria were more active during the day and the night, respectively. Interestingly, protein diel variations were observed in the photoautotroph Synechococcales and in (photo)-heterotrophic bacteria such as Flavobacteriales, Pelagibacterales and Rhodobacterales. Moreover, our data demonstrated that diel cycle impacts light-dependent processes such as photosynthesis and UV-stress response in Synechococcales and Rhodobacterales, respectively, while the protein regulation from the ubiquitous Pelagibacterales remained stable over time. This study unravels, for the first time, the diel variation in the protein expression of major free-living and particle-attached microbial players at the sea surface, totaling an analysis of eight metaproteomes.
PXD028958	34947003	Unravelling the Initial Triggers of Botrytis cinerea Infection: First Description of Its Surfactome. 	Unravelling the initial triggers of Botrytis cinerea infections. Botrytis cinerea surfactome	Botrytis cinerea, Shaving, surfactome, virulence factor and pathogenicity factor	Botrytis cinerea is a critically important phytopathogenic fungus, causing devastating crop losses; signal transduction cascades mediate the "dialogue" among the fungus, plant, and environment. Surface proteins play important roles as front-line receptors. We report the first description of the surfactome of a filamentous fungus. To obtain a complete view of these cascades during infection of B. cinerea, its surfactome has been described by optimization of the "shaving" process and LC-MS/MS at two different infection stages, and with both rapid and late responses to environmental changes. The best results were obtained using PBS buffer in the "shaving" protocol. The surfactome obtained comprises 1010 identified proteins. These have been categorized by gene ontology and protein-protein interactions to reveal new potential pathogenicity/virulence factors. From these data, the percentage of total proteins predicted for the genome of the fungus represented by proteins identified in this and other proteomics studies is calculated at 54%, a big increase over the previous 12%. The new data may be crucial for understanding better its biological activity and pathogenicity. Given its extensive exposure to plants and environmental conditions, the surfactome presents innumerable opportunities for interactions between the fungus and external elements, which should offer the best targets for fungicide development.
PXD029113	34948065	Sequestosome 1 Is Part of the Interaction Network of VAPB. 	Sequestosome 1 is part of the interaction network of VAPB	SQSTM1, VAPB, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, p62, sequestosome	VAPB (Vesicle-Associated-membrane Protein-associated protein B) is a tail-anchored membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that can also be detected at the inner nuclear membrane. As a component of many contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles, VAPB is engaged in multiple protein interactions with a plethora of binding partners. A mutant version of VAPB, P56S-VAPB, which results from a single point mutation, is involved in a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS8). We performed RAPIDS (rapamycin- and APEX-dependent identification of proteins by SILAC) to identify proteins that interact with or are in close proximity to P56S-VAPB. The mutation abrogates the interaction of VAPB with many known binding partners. Here, we identify Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), a well-known autophagic adapter protein, as a major interaction/proximity partner of P56S-VAPB. Remarkably, not only the mutant protein, but also wild-type VAPB interacts with SQSTM1, as shown by proximity ligation assays and co-immunoprecipiation experiments.
PXD029340	34948248	Interplay between DsbA1, DsbA2 and C8J_1298 Periplasmic Oxidoreductases of Campylobacter jejuni and Their Impact on Bacterial Physiology and Pathogenesis. 	Insight into the interplay between thiol oxidoreductases of oxidative activity of Campylobacter jejuni	Campylobacter, Dsb, bacteria	The bacterial proteins of the Dsb family catalyze the formation of disulfide bridges between cysteine residues that stabilize protein structures and ensure their proper functioning. Here, we report the detailed analysis of the Dsb pathway of Campylobacter jejuni. The oxidizing Dsb system of this pathogen is unique because it consists of two monomeric DsbAs (DsbA1 and DsbA2) and one dimeric bifunctional protein (C8J_1298). Previously, we showed that DsbA1 and C8J_1298 are redundant. Here, we unraveled the interaction between the two monomeric DsbAs by in vitro and in vivo experiments and by solving their structures and found that both monomeric DsbAs are dispensable proteins. Their structures confirmed that they are homologs of EcDsbL. The slight differences seen in the surface charge of the proteins do not affect the interaction with their redox partner. Comparative proteomics showed that several respiratory proteins, as well as periplasmic transport proteins, are targets of the Dsb system. Some of these, both donors and electron acceptors, are essential elements of the C. jejuni respiratory process under oxygen-limiting conditions in the host intestine. The data presented provide detailed information on the function of the C. jejuni Dsb system, identifying it as a potential target for novel antibacterial molecules.
PXD027104	34950111	Proteomic Analysis of a Syntrophic Coculture of Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans MPOB(T) and Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA(T). 	Syntrophic coculture of Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans MPOBT and Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA	Geobacter sulfurreducens, Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans, coculture, interspecies electron transfer, propionate	We established a syntrophic coculture of Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans MPOB(T) (SF) and Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA(T) (GS) growing on propionate and Fe(III). Neither of the bacteria was capable of growth on propionate and Fe(III) in pure culture. Propionate degradation by SF provides acetate, hydrogen, and/or formate that can be used as electron donors by GS with Fe(III) citrate as electron acceptor. Proteomic analyses of the SF-GS coculture revealed propionate conversion via the methylmalonyl-CoA (MMC) pathway by SF. The possibility of interspecies electron transfer (IET) via direct (DIET) and/or hydrogen/formate transfer (HFIT) was investigated by comparing the differential abundance of associated proteins in SF-GS coculture against (i) SF coculture with Methanospirillum hungatei (SF-MH), which relies on HFIT, (ii) GS pure culture growing on acetate, formate, hydrogen as propionate products, and Fe(III). We noted some evidence for DIET in the SF-GS coculture, i.e., GS in the coculture showed significantly lower abundance of uptake hydrogenase (43-fold) and formate dehydrogenase (45-fold) and significantly higher abundance of proteins related to acetate metabolism (i.e., GltA; 62-fold) compared to GS pure culture. Moreover, SF in the SF-GS coculture showed significantly lower abundance of IET-related formate dehydrogenases, Fdh3 (51-fold) and Fdh5 (29-fold), and the rate of propionate conversion in SF-GS was 8-fold lower than in the SF-MH coculture. In contrast, compared to GS pure culture, we found lower abundance of pilus-associated cytochrome OmcS (2-fold) and piliA (5-fold) in the SF-GS coculture that is suggested to be necessary for DIET. Furthermore, neither visible aggregates formed in the SF-GS coculture, nor the pili-E of SF (suggested as e-pili) were detected. These findings suggest that the IET mechanism is complex in the SF-GS coculture and can be mediated by several mechanisms rather than one discrete pathway. Our study can be further useful in understanding syntrophic propionate degradation in bioelectrochemical and anaerobic digestion systems.
PXD032250	34950162	Identification and Validation of Stable Quantitative Trait Loci for SDS-Sedimentation Volume in Common Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). 	Proteomic raw data of wheat accessions Xinong291S and Xinong291	Anther, Sterile, Wheat	Sodium dodecyl sulfate-sedimentation volume is an important index to evaluate the gluten strength of common wheat and is closely related to baking quality. In this study, a total of 15 quantitative trait locus (QTL) for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-sedimentation volume (SSV) were identified by using a high-density genetic map including 2,474 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, which was constructed with a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from the cross between Non-gda3753 (ND3753) and Liangxing99 (LX99). Importantly, four environmentally stable QTLs were detected on chromosomes 1A, 2D, and 5D, respectively. Among them, the one with the largest effect was identified on chromosome 1A (designated as QSsv.cau-1A.1) explaining up to 39.67% of the phenotypic variance. Subsequently, QSsv.cau-1A.1 was dissected into two QTLs named as QSsv.cau-1A.1.1 and QSsv.cau-1A.1.2 by saturating the genetic linkage map of the chromosome 1A. Interestedly, favorable alleles of these two loci were from different parents. Due to the favorable allele of QSsv.cau-1A.1.1 was from the high-value parents ND3753 and revealed higher genetic effect, which explained 25.07% of the phenotypic variation, mapping of this locus was conducted by using BC3F1 and BC3F2 populations. By comparing the CS reference sequence, the physical interval of QSsv.cau-1A.1.1 was delimited into 14.9 Mb, with 89 putative high-confidence annotated genes. SSVs of different recombinants between QSsv.cau-1A.1.1 and QSsv.cau-1A.1 detected from DH and BC3F2 populations showed that these two loci had an obvious additive effect, of which the combination of two favorable loci had the high SSV, whereas recombinants with unfavorable loci had the lowest. These results provide further insight into the genetic basis of SSV and QSsv.cau-1A.1.1 will be an ideal target for positional cloning and wheat breeding programs.
PXD028305	34950656	YKL-40 Aggravates Early-Stage Atherosclerosis by Inhibiting Macrophage Apoptosis in an Aven-dependent Way. 	Downstream Molecules of YKL-40 in Regulating Apoptosis in BMDM	BMDM, YKL-40, apoptosis, downstream molecules	Objective: programmed cell removal in atherosclerotic plaques plays a crucial role in retarding lesion progression. Macrophage apoptosis has a critical role in PrCR, especially in early-stage lesions. YKL-40 has been shown to be elevated as lesions develop and is closely related to macrophages. This study aimed to determine the effect of YKL-40 on regulating macrophage apoptosis and early-stage atherosclerosis progression. Research design and Methods: The correlations among the expression level of YKL-40, the area of early-stage plaque, and the macrophage apoptosis rate in plaques have been shown in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques through pathological and molecular biological detection. These results were successively confirmed in vivo (Ldlr (-/-) mice treated by YKL-40 recombinant protein/neutralizing antibody) and in vitro (macrophages that Ykl40 up-/down-expressed) experiments. The downstream targets were predicted by iTRAQ analysis. Results: In early-stage human carotid plaques and murine plaques, the YKL-40 expression level had a significant positive correlation with the area of the lesion and a significant negative correlation with the macrophage apoptosis rate. In vivo, the plaque area of aortic roots was significantly larger in the recomb-YKL-40 group than that in IgG group (p = 0.0247) and was significantly smaller in the anti-YKL-40 group than in the IgG group (p = 0.0067); the macrophage apoptosis rate of the plaque in aortic roots was significantly lower in the recomb-YKL-40 group than that in IgG group (p = 0.0018) and was higher in anti-YKL-40 group than that in VC group. In vitro, the activation level of caspase-9 was significantly lower in RAW264.7 with Ykl40 overexpressed than that in controls (p = 0.0054), while the expression level of Aven was significantly higher than that in controls (p = 0.0031). The apoptosis rate of RAW264.7 treated by recomb-YKL40 was significantly higher in the Aven down-regulated group than that in the control group (p < 0.001). The apoptosis inhibitor Aven was confirmed as the target molecule of YKL-40. Mechanistically, YKL-40 could inhibit macrophage apoptosis by upregulating Aven to suppress the activation of caspase-9. Conclusion: YKL-40 inhibits macrophage apoptosis by upregulating the apoptosis inhibitor Aven to suppress the activation of caspase-9, which may impede normal PrCR and promote substantial accumulation in early-stage plaques, thereby leading to the progression of atherosclerosis.
PXD022095	34950757	A high-resolution mass spectrometry based proteomic dataset of human regulatory T cells. 	CD49f defines a subset of dysfunctional regulatory T cells circulating in the human peripheral blood	Regulatory T cells, Shotgun proteomics	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a core role in maintaining immune tolerance, homeostasis, and host health. High-resolution analysis of the Treg proteome is required to identify enriched biological processes and pathways distinct to this important immune cell lineage. We present a comprehensive proteomic dataset of Tregs paired with conventional CD4(+) (Conv CD4(+)) T cells in healthy individuals. Tregs and Conv CD4(+) T cells were sorted to high purity using dual magnetic bead-based and flow cytometry-based methodologies. Proteins were trypsin-digested and analysed using label-free data-dependent acquisition mass spectrometry (DDA-MS) followed by label free quantitation (LFQ) proteomics analysis using MaxQuant software. Approximately 4,000 T cell proteins were identified with a 1% false discovery rate, of which approximately 2,800 proteins were consistently identified and quantified in all the samples. Finally, flow cytometry with a monoclonal antibody was used to validate the elevated abundance of the protein phosphatase CD148 in Tregs. This proteomic dataset serves as a reference point for future mechanistic and clinical T cell immunology and identifies receptors, processes, and pathways distinct to Tregs. Collectively, these data will lead to a better understanding of Treg immunophysiology and potentially reveal novel leads for therapeutics seeking Treg regulation.
PXD027639	34951965	Translocation of polyubiquitinated protein substrates by the hexameric Cdc48 ATPase. 	Translocation of polyubiquitinated protein substrates by the hexameric Cdc48 ATPase	AAA ATPase, HDX-MS, Npl4, Ufd1, VCP, hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, p97, translocation, ubiquitin, unfolding	The hexameric Cdc48 ATPase (p97 or VCP in mammals) cooperates with its cofactor Ufd1/Npl4 to extract polyubiquitinated proteins from membranes or macromolecular complexes for degradation by the proteasome. Here, we clarify how the Cdc48 complex unfolds its substrates and translocates polypeptides with branchpoints. The Cdc48 complex recognizes primarily polyubiquitin chains rather than the attached substrate. Cdc48 and Ufd1/Npl4 cooperatively bind the polyubiquitin chain, resulting in the unfolding of one ubiquitin molecule (initiator). Next, the ATPase pulls on the initiator ubiquitin and moves all ubiquitin molecules linked to its C terminus through the central pore of the hexameric double ring, causing transient ubiquitin unfolding. When the ATPase reaches the isopeptide bond of the substrate, it can translocate and unfold both N- and C-terminal segments. Ubiquitins linked to the branchpoint of the initiator dissociate from Ufd1/Npl4 and move outside the central pore, resulting in the release of unfolded, polyubiquitinated substrate from Cdc48.
PXD029763	34954106	Membrane proteomic analysis identifies the polarity protein PARD3 as a novel antiviral protein against PEDV infection. 	Differential membrane proteomics of PEDV infected Vero cells	PEDV, Vero cells, membrane	Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly pathogenic enteric coronavirus causing lethal watery diarrhea in suckling piglets. PEDV could remodel host membrane structures for their replication, assembly and escape from host cells. However, little is known about the host membrane proteins of PEDV infection. In this study, we analyzed differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) between PEDV infection group and control group and identified the polarity protein PARD3 as one of the most significantly DAPs. PARD3 is implicated in the formation of tight junctions at epithelial cell-cell contacts. Then, we found that PEDV infection promoted the degradation of PARD3 via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Moreover, knockdown of PARD3 promoted the proliferation of PEDV. Further study showed that the downregulation of PARD3 altered the normal morphology of the tight junction proteins and promoted apical and basolateral virus proliferation. Tight junctions enable epithelial cells to form physical barriers, which act as an innate immune mechanism that can impede viral infection and PEDV affected the barrier functions by causing degradation of PARD3. Taken together, this work is the first time to investigate the membrane protein profile of PEDV-infected cells using quantitative proteomics and suggests that PARD3 could be a potential novel antiviral protein against PEDV infection. SIGNIFICANCE: Membrane proteins are involved in various physiological and biochemical functions critical for cellular function. It is also dynamic in nature, where many proteins are changed during in response to environmental stress. However, membrane proteins are difficult to study because of their hydrophobicity. Membrane proteomic methods using mass spectrometry analysis have been developed and applied for the characterization of the plasma membrane and subcellular organelles of various virus infected cells. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enteric pathogen of importance to the swine industry, causing high mortality in neonatal piglets. Because PEDV infected Vero cells can lead to significant changes in cell membrane morphology and form syncytial lesions. Here, we isolated the membrane proteins of PEDV infected and control cells and applied isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantitatively identify the differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in PEDV-infected Vero cells and confirmed the DAPs by performing RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Among these differential proteins, we focused on a down-regulated protein PARD3 which is important for cell tight junction and cell polarity. Loss of PARD3 can destroy the tight junction of cells and promote the proliferation of PEDV in the apical and basolateral sides. These findings will provide valuable information to better understand the mechanisms underlying the host defense responses to PEDV infection.
PXD028982	34954141	Installation of O-glycan sulfation capacities in human HEK293 cells for display of sulfated mucins. 	Installation of O-glycan sulfation capacities in human HEK293 cells	Glycosylation, MUC1, O-glycans, sulfated-T, sulfated-Tn, sulfation	The human genome contains at least 35 genes that encode Golgi sulfotransferases that function in the secretory pathway, where they are involved in decorating glycosaminoglycans, glycolipids, and glycoproteins with sulfate groups. Although a number of important interactions by proteins such as selectins, galectins, and sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins are thought to mainly rely on sulfated O-glycans, our insight into the sulfotransferases that modify these glycoproteins, and in particular GalNAc-type O-glycoproteins, is limited. Moreover, sulfated mucins appear to accumulate in respiratory diseases, arthritis, and cancer. To explore further the genetic and biosynthetic regulation of sulfated O-glycans, here we expanded a cell-based glycan array in the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line with sulfation capacities. We stably engineered O-glycan sulfation capacities in HEK293 cells by site-directed knockin of sulfotransferase genes in combination with knockout of genes to eliminate endogenous O-glycan branching (core2 synthase gene GCNT1) and/or sialylation capacities in order to provide simplified substrates (core1 Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr) for the introduced sulfotransferases. Expression of the galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase 2 in HEK293 cells resulted in sulfation of core1 and core2 O-glycans, whereas expression of galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase 4 resulted in sulfation of core1 only. We used the engineered cell library to dissect the binding specificity of galectin-4 and confirmed binding to the 3-O-sulfo-core1 O-glycan. This is a first step toward expanding the emerging cell-based glycan arrays with the important sulfation modification for display and production of glycoconjugates with sulfated O-glycans.
PXD028233	34954142	Protein acetylation-mediated cross regulation of acetic acid and ethanol synthesis in the gas-fermenting Clostridium ljungdahlii. 	The acetylated lysine residues in C. ljungdahlii	lysine acetylation	The autotrophic acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii has emerged as a major candidate in the biological conversion of one-carbon gases (CO2/CO) to bulk chemicals and fuels. Nevertheless, the regulatory pathways and downstream metabolic changes responsible for product formation and distribution in this bacterium remain minimally explored. Protein lysine acetylation (PLA), a prevalent posttranslational modification, controls numerous crucial cellular functions. Herein, we revealed a novel cross-regulatory mechanism that uses both the PLA system and transcription factors to regulate the carbon flow distribution for product formation in C. ljungdahlii. The dominant acetylation/deacetylation system (At2/Dat1) in C. ljungdahlii was found to regulate the ratio of two major products, acetic acid and ethanol. Subsequent genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that the activities of Pta and AdhE1, two crucial enzymes responsible for acetic acid and ethanol synthesis, respectively, were greatly affected by their levels of PLA. We found that the acetylation statuses of Pta and AdhE1 underwent significant dynamic changes during the fermentation process, leading to differential synthesis of acetic acid and ethanol. Furthermore, the crucial redox-sensing protein Rex was shown to be regulated by PLA, which subsequently altered its transcriptional regulation on genes responsible for acetic acid and ethanol formation and distribution. Based on our understanding of this cross-regulatory module, we optimized the ethanol synthetic pathway by modifying the acetylation status (deacetylation-mimicked mutations of crucial lysine residues) of the related key enzyme, achieving significantly increased titer and yield of ethanol, an important chemical and fuel, by C. ljungdahlii in gas fermentation.
PXD028923	34954235	The Conformational State of the BTK Substrate PLCgamma Contributes to Ibrutinib Resistance. 	The conformational state of PLCgamma cSH2-linker contributes to Ibrutinib resistance	HDX-MS, Ibrutinib resistance, NMR, PLCgamma, Phospholipase C gamma, SH2 domain., allostery, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry	Mutations in PLCgamma, a substrate of the tyrosine kinase BTK, are often found in patients who develop resistance to the BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib. However, the mechanisms by which these PLCgamma mutations cause Ibrutinib resistance are unclear. Under normal signaling conditions, BTK mediated phosphorylation of Y783 within the PLCgamma cSH2-linker promotes the intramolecular association of this site with the adjacent cSH2 domain resulting in active PLCgamma. Thus, the cSH2-linker region in the center of the regulatory gamma specific array (gammaSA) of PLCgamma is a key feature controlling PLCgamma activity. Even in the unphosphorylated state this linker exists in a conformational equilibrium between free and bound to the cSH2 domain. The position of this equilibrium is optimized within the properly regulated PLCgamma enzyme but may be altered in the context of mutations. We therefore assessed the conformational status of four resistance associated mutations within the PLCgamma gammaSA and find that they each alter the conformational equilibrium of the gammaSA leading to a shift toward active PLCgamma. Interestingly, two distinct modes of mutation induced activation are revealed by this panel of Ibrutinib resistance mutations. These findings, along with the recently determined structure of fully autoinhibited PLCgamma, provide new insight into the nature of the conformational change that occurs within the gammaSA regulatory region to affect PLCgamma activation. Improving our mechanistic understanding of how B cell signaling escapes Ibrutinib treatment via mutations in PLCgamma will aid in the development of strategies to counter drug resistance.
PXD027582	34954402	Absence of COVID-19-associated changes in plasma coagulation proteins and pulmonary thrombosis in the ferret model. 	Absence of COVID-19-associated Changes in Coagulation and Thrombosis in the Ferret Model	COVID-19, Ferrets, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, Thrombosis	BACKGROUND: Many patients who are diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suffer from venous thromboembolic complications despite the use of stringent anticoagulant prophylaxis. Studies on the exact mechanism(s) underlying thrombosis in COVID-19 are limited as animal models commonly used to study venous thrombosis pathophysiology (i.e. rats and mice) are naturally not susceptible to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Ferrets are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, successfully used to study virus transmission, and have been previously used to study activation of coagulation and thrombosis during influenza virus infection. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the use of (heat-inactivated) plasma and lung material from SARS-CoV-2-inoculated ferrets studying COVID-19-associated changes in coagulation and thrombosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Histology and longitudinal plasma profiling using mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach was performed. RESULTS: Lungs of ferrets inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated alveolar septa that were mildly expanded by macrophages, and diffuse interstitial histiocytic pneumonia. However, no macroscopical or microscopical evidence of vascular thrombosis in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-inoculated ferrets was found. Longitudinal plasma profiling revealed minor differences in plasma protein profiles in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated ferrets up to 2 weeks post-infection. The majority of plasma coagulation factors were stable and demonstrated a low coefficient of variation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that while ferrets are an essential and well-suited animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 transmission, their use to study SARS-CoV-2-related changes relevant to thrombotic disease is limited.
PXD010378	34955646	iTRAQ and PRM-Based Proteomic Analysis Provides New Insights into Mechanisms of Response to Triple Therapy in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. 	Screening protein predictive of response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors treatment in rheumatoid arthritis by using iTRAQ technique and investigating its mechanism through signal pathway	ProteomeXchange project tag: Human Proteome Project, iTRAQ, predictive of response, rheumatoid arthritis, signal pathway, tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor	BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) respond poorly to combination therapy of multiple drugs. The molecular mechanisms of different responses to methotrexate + leflunomide + infliximab therapy in patients with RA were explored in this study. METHODS: Infliximab was administered to patients with RA whose disease activity score was higher than 5.1 after 1 month of combination therapy with methotrexate and leflunomide. After 14 weeks of undergoing triple therapy, patients with RA were classified as responders and non-responders. Protein profiles at baseline and 14th week were investigated via isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), and proteins with significant differences >=1.2 folds change or <=0.8 folds change were defined as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Overlapping DEPs between responders and non-responders were confirmed by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Bioinformatic analyses were performed for DEPs. RESULTS: The results revealed 5 non-responders (NRs) and 15 responders (Rs). iTRAQ analysis indicated 13 overlapping DEPs and included 6 opposite change DEPs such as testicular tissue protein Li 70, cofilin 1, fibrinogen beta chain, galectin-10, serotransferrin (TF) and albumin. The difference in serotransferrin between responders and non-responders confirmed by PRM was significant. Verification by PRM indicated that TF was elevated in the Rs group and was reduced in the NRs group. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that serotransferrin was involved in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 pathway and ferroptosis. CONCLUSION: Serotransferrin-related molecular mechanism may be a new direction to study refractory RA.
PXD029740	34956212	Next-Generation Sequencing and Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid From COVID-19 Patients With Neurological Manifestations. 	Proteomics of Cerebrospinal fluid from COVID-19 Patients with Neurological Manifestations	COVID-19, Cerebrospinal fluid, Serum	The SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are still hitting the world. Ever since the outbreak, neurological involvements as headache, ageusia, and anosmia in COVID-19 patients have been emphasized and reported. But the pathogenesis of these new-onset neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients is still obscure and controversial. As difficulty always lay in the diagnosis of neurological infection, current reports to validate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) almost relied on the basic methods and warranted improvement. Here we reported a case series of 8 patients with prominent new-onset neurological manifestations, who were screened out from a patch of 304 COVID-19 confirmed patients. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and proteomics were conducted in the simultaneously obtained CSF and serum samples of the selected patients, with three non-COVID-19 patients with matched demographic features used as the controls for proteomic analysis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the CSF of four COVID-19 patients and was suspicious in the rest four remaining patients by NGS, but was negative in all serum samples. Proteomic analysis revealed that 185 and 59 proteins were differentially expressed in CSF and serum samples, respectively, and that only 20 proteins were shared, indicating that the proteomic changes in CSF were highly specific. Further proteomic annotation highlighted the involvement of complement system, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, enhanced cellular interaction, and macrophages in the CSF proteomic alterations. This study, equipped with NGS and proteomics, reported a high detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF of COVID-19 patients and the proteomic alteration of CSF, which would provide insights into understanding the pathological mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 CNS infection.
PXD029134	34956288	Melatonin Promotes the Chilling Tolerance of Cucumber Seedlings by Regulating Antioxidant System and Relieving Photoinhibition. 	Melatonin promotes chilling tolerance of cucumber seedlings by regulating antioxidant systems and relieving photoinhibition	Antioxidant system, Chilling stress, Cucumber, Melatonin, Photosynthesis, Reactive oxygen	Chilling adversely affects the photosynthesis of thermophilic plants, which further leads to a decline in growth and yield. The role of melatonin (MT) in the stress response of plants has been investigated, while the mechanisms by which MT regulates the chilling tolerance of chilling-sensitive cucumber remain unclear. This study demonstrated that MT positively regulated the chilling tolerance of cucumber seedlings and that 1.0 mumol.L(-1) was the optimum concentration, of which the chilling injury index, electrolyte leakage (EL), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were the lowest, while growth was the highest among all treatments. MT triggered the activity and expression of antioxidant enzymes, which in turn decreased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2 (.-)) accumulation caused by chilling stress. Meanwhile, MT attenuated the chilling-induced decrease, in the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and promoted photoprotection for both photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI), regarding the higher maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), actual photochemical efficiency (PhiPSII), the content of active P700 (DeltaI/I0), and photosynthetic electron transport. The proteome analysis and western blot data revealed that MT upregulated the protein levels of PSI reaction center subunits (PsaD, PsaE, PsaF, PsaH, and PsaN), PSII-associated protein PsbA (D1), and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase or oxygenase large subunit (RBCL) and Rubisco activase (RCA). These results suggest that MT enhances the chilling tolerance of cucumber through the activation of antioxidant enzymes and the induction of key PSI-, PSII-related and carbon assimilation genes, which finally alleviates damage to the photosynthetic apparatus and decreases oxidative damage to cucumber seedlings under chilling stress.
PXD029066	34957219	Impact of the Glycemic Level on the Salivary Proteome of Middle-Aged and Elderly People With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: An Observational Study. 	Comparative salivary proteomics of  people with different blood glucose levels	Quantitative proteomics, blood glucose, saliva	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an increasing global public health concern, but its impact on the salivary proteome is still unclear. To evaluate the effect of glycemic levels in middle-aged and elderly individuals with T2DM on salivary proteomics, we compared the differences by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Unstimulated whole saliva samples from 8 T2DM patients with good glycemic control (G group, HbA1c <6.5%) and 16 patients with poor control (P group, HbA1c >=6.5%) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in the data-independent acquisition mode (Clinical register number: ChiCTR1900023582.). After functional annotation, cluster analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were carried out to screen and evaluate candidate proteins. A total of 5,721 proteins were quantified, while 40 proteins differed significantly. In the P group, proteins involved in oxidative stress-related processes were upregulated, whereas proteins related to salivary secretion were downregulated. The combination of thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17, zymogen granule protein 16B, and FAM3 metabolism regulating signaling molecule D yielded an area under the curve of 0.917 which showed a robust ability to distinguish the P and G groups. In conclusion, poorly controlled hyperglycemia may affect salivary proteins through various pathways, including oxidative stress and glandular secretion. Furthermore, the differentially expressed proteins, especially the three proteins with the best differentiation, might serve as an anchor point for the further study of hyperglycemia and oral diseases.
PXD026856	34957273	Plasma Proteomics Characteristics of Subclinical Vitamin E Deficiency of Dairy Cows During Early Lactation. 	Plasma proteomics characteristics of subclinical vitamin E deficiency of dairy cows during early lactation	TMT, biomarkers, differentially expressed proteins, plasma., subclinical VE deficiency	Vitamin E (VE) is an essential fat-soluble nutrient for dairy cows. Vitamin E deficiency leads to immune suppression and oxidative stress and increases the susceptibility of cows to reproductive disorders in the early post-partum period. However, studies on plasma proteomics of VE deficiency have not been reported so far. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand the changes of blood protein profile in cows with subclinical VE deficiency in the early post-partum period. In this study, plasma protein levels of 14 healthy cows (>4 mug/ml alpha-tocopherol) and 13 subclinical VE-deficient cows (2-3 mug/ml alpha-tocopherol) were analyzed by tandem mass tag (TMT). The results showed that there were 26 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the plasma of cows with subclinical VE deficiency compared with healthy controls. Twenty-one kinds of proteins were downregulated, and five kinds were upregulated, among which eight proteins in protein-protein interactions (PPI) network had direct interaction. These proteins are mainly involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, pantothenic acid and coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis. The top four DEPs in PPI (APOC3, APOC4, SAA4, PHLD) and one important protein (VNN1) by literature review were further verified by ELISA and Western blot. The expression levels of APOC3, VNN1, and SAA4 were significantly lower than those of healthy controls by ELISA. VNN1 was significantly lower than those of healthy controls by Western blot. VNN1 is closely related to dairy cow subclinical VE deficiency and can be a potential biomarker. It lays a foundation for further research on the lack of pathological mechanism and antioxidative stress of VE.
PXD027177	34958553	Proteomic Analysis Reveals Low-Dose PARP Inhibitor-Induced Differential Protein Expression in BRCA1-Mutated High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Cells. 	Proteomic analysis reveals low dose PARP inhibitor-induced differential protein expression in BRCA1-mutated high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells	PARP inhibitor (PARPi), ovarian cancer, tandem mass tags (TMT)	High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common form of ovarian cancer diagnosed in patients worldwide. Patients with BRCA1/2-mutated HGSOC have benefited from targeted treatments such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Despite the initial success of PARPi-based ovarian cancer treatment regimens, approximately 70% of patients with ovarian cancer relapse and the 5-year survival rate remains at 30%. PARPi exhibit variable treatment efficacy and toxicity profiles. Furthermore, the off-target effects of PARP inhibition have not yet been fully elucidated, warranting further study of these classes of molecules in the context of HGSOC treatment. Highly reproducible quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic workflows have been developed for the analysis of tumor tissues and cell lines. To detect the off-target effects of PARP inhibition, we conducted a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of a BRCA1-mutated HGSOC cell line treated with low doses of two PARPi, niraparib and rucaparib. Our goal was to identify PARPi-induced protein signaling pathway alterations toward a more comprehensive elucidation of the mechanism of action of PARPi beyond the DNA damage response pathway. A significant enrichment of nuclear and nucleoplasm proteins that are involved in protein binding was observed in the rucaparib-treated cells. Shared upregulated proteins between niraparib and rucaparib treatment demonstrated RNA II pol promoter-associated pathway enrichment in transcription regulation. Pathway enrichment analyses also revealed off-target effects in the Golgi apparatus and the ER. The results from our mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis highlights notable off-target effects produced by low-dose treatment of BRCA1-mutated HGSOC cells treated with rucaparib or niraparib.
PXD019440	34958708	BLI-MS: Combining biolayer interferometry and mass spectrometry. 	BLI-MS: combining Biolayer Interferometry and Mass Spectrometry	Biolayer Interferometry, molecular interaction	Biolayer interferometry (BLI) is a technology which allows to study the affinity between two interacting macro-molecules and to visualize their kinetic of interaction in real time. In this work, we combine BLI interaction measurement with mass spectrometry in order to identify the proteins interacting with the bait. We provide for the first time the proof of concept of the feasibility of BLI-MS in complex biological mixtures.
PXD023026	34958836	Histone acetylation of bile acid transporter genes plays a critical role in cirrhosis. 	MCRS1 is a histone acetylation regulator whose loss in hepatocytes promotes cirrhosis	MCRS1, hepatocytes, iTRAQ	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Owing to the lack of genetic animal models that adequately recreate key clinical characteristics of cirrhosis, the molecular pathogenesis of cirrhosis has been poorly characterized, and treatments remain limited. Hence, we aimed to better elucidate the pathological mechanisms of cirrhosis using a novel murine model. METHODS: We report on the first murine genetic model mimicking human cirrhosis induced by hepatocyte-specific elimination of microspherule protein 1 (MCRS1), a member of non-specific lethal (NSL) and INO80 chromatin-modifier complexes. Using this genetic tool with other mouse models, cell culture and human samples, combined with quantitative proteomics, single nuclei/cell RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we investigated mechanisms of cirrhosis. RESULTS: MCRS1 loss in mouse hepatocytes modulates the expression of bile acid (BA) transporters - with a pronounced downregulation of Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) - concentrating BAs in sinusoids and thereby activating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) via the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which is predominantly expressed in human and mouse HSCs. Consistently, re-expression of NTCP in mice reduces cirrhosis, and genetic ablation of FXR in HSCs suppresses fibrotic marks in mice and in vitro cell culture. Mechanistically, deletion of a putative SANT domain from MCRS1 evicts histone deacetylase 1 from its histone H3 anchoring sites, increasing histone acetylation of BA transporter genes, modulating their expression and perturbing BA flow. Accordingly, human cirrhosis displays decreased nuclear MCRS1 and NTCP expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal a previously unrecognized function of MCRS1 as a critical histone acetylation regulator, maintaining gene expression and liver homeostasis. MCRS1 loss induces acetylation of BA transporter genes, perturbation of BA flow, and consequently, FXR activation in HSCs. This axis represents a central and universal signaling event in cirrhosis, which has significant implications for cirrhosis treatment. LAY SUMMARY: By genetic ablation of MCRS1 in mouse hepatocytes, we generate the first genetic mouse model of cirrhosis that recapitulates human features. Herein, we demonstrate that the activation of the bile acid/FXR axis in liver fibroblasts is key in cirrhosis development.
PXD027960	34962382	One-Step Isolation of Protein C-Terminal Peptides from V8 Protease-Digested Proteins by Metal Oxide-Based Ligand-Exchange Chromatography. 	One-step Isolation of Protein C-terminal Peptides from Protease-digested Proteins by Metal Oxide-based Ligand Exchange Chromatography	C-terminomics, Protein C-terminal peptide enrichment, metal oxide ligand exchange chromatography	We have developed a one-step method to isolate protein C-terminal peptides from V8 protease-digested proteins by metal oxide-based ligand-exchange (MOLEX) chromatography. V8 protease cleaves the C-terminal side of Asp and Glu, affording a digested peptide with two carboxy groups at the C-terminus, whereas the protein C-terminal peptide has only one alpha-carboxy group. In MOLEX chromatography, a stable chelate is formed between dicarboxylates and metal atoms, so that the nonterminal (i.e., internal) peptide is retained, whereas the protein C-terminal peptide flows through the MOLEX column. After the optimization of the MOLEX chromatographic conditions, 1619 protein C-termini were identified from 30 mug of peptides (10 mug each, in triplicate) derived from human HeLa cells by means of nanoLC/MS/MS. When the MOLEX-isolated sample from 200 mug of HeLa peptides was further divided into six fractions by high-pH reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) prior to nanoLC/MS/MS, 2203 protein C-termini were identified with less than 3% contamination with internal peptides. We believe that this is the largest coverage with the highest purity reported to date in human protein C-terminomics. This fast, simple, sensitive, and selective method to isolate protein C-terminal peptides should be useful for profiling protein C-termini on a proteome-wide scale.
PXD045435	34962719	Validation of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for hereditary angioedema via plasma N-glycomics. 	Non-invasive biomarker discovery in hereditary angioedema	hereditary angioedema, urine	BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease with heterogeneous clinical symptoms. It is vitally important to predict whether an HAE patient will develop severe symptoms in clinical practice, but there are currently no predictive biomarkers for HAE stratification. Plasma N-glycomes are disease-specific and have great potential for the discovery of non-invasive biomarkers. In this study, we profiled the plasma N-glycome of HAE patients from two independent cohorts to identify candidate biomarkers. METHODS: Linkage-specific sialylation derivatization combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry detection and automated data processing was employed to analyze the plasma N-glycome of two independent type-1 HAE cohorts. RESULTS: HAE patients had abnormal glycan complexity, galactosylation, and alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-linked sialylation compared to healthy controls (HC). The classification models based on dysregulated glycan traits could successfully discriminate between HAE and HC with area under the curves (AUCs) being greater than 0.9. Some of the aberrant glycans showed response to therapy. Moreover, we identified a series of glycan traits with strong associations with the occurrence of laryngeal or gastrointestinal angioedema or disease severity score. Predictive models based on these traits could be used to predict disease severity (AUC > 0.9). These results were replicated in an independent cohort. CONCLUSIONS: We reported the full plasma N-glycomic signature of HAE for the first time, and identified potential biomarkers. These findings may play a critical role in predicting disease severity and guide the treatment of HAE in clinical practice. Further protein-specific and prospective studies are needed to validate our findings.
PXD029534	34962767	A Broad-Specificity O-Glycoprotease That Enables Improved Analysis of Glycoproteins and Glycopeptides Containing Intact Complex O-Glycans. 	A broad-specificity O-glycoprotease that enables improved analysis of glycoproteins and glycopeptides containing intact complex O-glycans	CD45, G-CSF	Characterization of mucin-type O-glycans linked to serine/threonine of glycoproteins is technically challenging, in part, due to a lack of effective enzymatic tools that enable their analysis. Recently, several O-glycan-specific endoproteases that can cleave the protein adjacent to the appended glycan have been described. Despite significant progress in understanding the biochemistry of these enzymes, known O-glycoproteases have specificity constraints, such as inefficient cleavage of glycoproteins bearing sialylated O-glycans, high selectivity for certain types of glycoproteins, or protein sequence bias. These factors limit their analytical application. In this study, we examined the capabilities of an immunomodulating metalloprotease (IMPa) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Peptide sequence selectivity and its impact on IMPa activity were interrogated using an array of synthetic peptides and their glycoforms. We show that IMPa has no specific P1 residue preference and can tolerate most amino acids at the P1 position, except aspartic acid. The enzyme does not cleave between two adjacent O-glycosites, indicating that O-glycosylated serine/threonine is not allowed at position P1. Glycopeptides with as few as two amino acids on either side of an O-glycosite were cleaved by IMPa. Finally, IMPa efficiently cleaved peptides and proteins carrying sialylated and asialylated O-glycans of varying complexity. We present the use of IMPa in a one-step O-glycoproteomic workflow for glycoprofiling of the purified glycoproteins granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C without the need for glycopeptide enrichment. In these examples, IMPa enabled both the identification of O-glycosites and the range of complex O-glycan structures at each site.
PXD018665	34963445	Integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles in placenta accreta reveals trophoblast over-migration as the underlying pathogenesis. 	Proteomics profiling of placental tissues from placenta accreta and control pregnancies	placenta accreta	BACKGROUND: Placenta accreta (PA) is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in modern obstetrics, few studies have explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: In our study, transcriptome and proteome profiling were performed in placental tissues from ten participants including five cases each in the PA and control groups to clarify the pathogenesis of PA. RESULTS: We identified differential expression of 37,743 transcripts and 160 proteins between the PA and control groups with an overlap rate of 0.09%. The 33 most-significant transcripts and proteins were found and further screened and analyzed. Adhesion-related signature, chemotaxis related signatures and immune related signature were found in the PA group and played a certain role. Sum up two points, three significant indicators, methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MeCP2), podocin (PODN), and apolipoprotein D (ApoD), which participate in "negative regulation of cell migration", were downregulated at the mRNA and protein levels in PA group. Furthermore, transwell migration and invasion assay of HTR-8/SVneo cell indicated the all of them impaired the migration and invasion of trophoblast. CONCLUSION: A poor correlation was observed between the transcriptome and proteome data and MeCP2, PODN, and ApoD decreased in transcriptome and proteome profiling, resulting in increased migration of trophoblasts in the PA group, which clarify the mechanism of PA and might be the biomarkers or therapy targets in the future.
PXD026204	34964541	Analytical comparison of absolute quantification strategies to investigate the insulin signaling pathway in fat cells. 	Analytical Comparison of absolute quantification strategies to investigate the Insulin signaling pathway in fat cells	Insulin Signalling Proteins, PRM	So far, mass spectrometry-based targeted proteomics is the most sensitive approach to answer and address specific biological questions in an accurate and quantitative fashion. However, the data analysis design used for such quantification varies in the field leading to discrepancies in the reported values. In this study, different quantification strategies based on calibration curves were evaluated and compared. The best accuracy and coefficient of variation was achieved by ratio to ratio calibration curves. We applied the ratio to ratio quantification approach to analyze very low abundant insulin signaling proteins such as PIK3RA (0.10-0.93 fmol/mug), AKT1 (0.1-0.39 fmol/mug), and the insulin receptor (0.22-2.62 fmol/mug) in a fat cell model and demonstrated the adaptation of this pathway at different states of insulin sensitivity.
PXD025162	34964596	In-Depth Site-Specific O-Glycosylation Analysis of Glycoproteins and Endogenous Peptides in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) from Healthy Individuals, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Patients. 	In-depth site-specific O-glycosylation analysis of glycoproteins and endogenous peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from healthy individual mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) patients	Alzheimers disease, CSF, O-glycosylation	Site-specific O-glycoproteome mapping in complex biological systems provides a molecular basis for understanding the structure-function relationships of glycoproteins and their roles in physiological and pathological processes. Previous O-glycoproteome analysis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) focused on sialylated glycoforms, while missing information on other glycosylation types. In order to achieve an unbiased O-glycosylation profile, we developed an integrated strategy combining universal boronic acid enrichment, high-pH fractionation, and electron-transfer and higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD) for enhanced intact O-glycopeptide analysis. We applied this strategy to analyze the O-glycoproteome in CSF, resulting in the identification of 308 O-glycopeptides from 110 O-glycoproteins, covering both sialylated and nonsialylated glycoforms. To our knowledge, this is the largest data set of O-glycoproteins and O-glycosites reported for CSF to date. We also developed a peptidomics workflow that utilized the EThcD and a three-step database searching strategy for comprehensive PTM analysis of endogenous peptides, including N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and other common peptide PTMs. Interestingly, among the 1411 endogenous peptides identified, 89 were O-glycosylated, and only one N-glycosylated peptide was found, indicating that CSF endogenous peptides were predominantly O-glycosylated. Analyses of the O-glycoproteome and endogenous peptidome PTMs were also conducted in the CSF of MCI and AD patients to provide a landscape of glycosylation patterns in different disease states. Our results showed a decreasing trend in fucosylation and an increasing trend of endogenous peptide O-glycosylation, which may play an important role in AD progression.
PXD024795	34965100	Chloride-Mediated Peroxide-Free Photochemical Oxidation of Proteins (PPOP) in Mass Spectrometry-Based Structural Analysis. 	BSA,HSA,myoglobin,mouse liver LC-MS/MS	BSA, HSA, mouse liver LC-MS/MS, myoglobin	Ultraviolet (UV) laser photolysis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for the in situ generation of hydroxyl radicals ((*)OH) is a widely utilized strategy in the oxidation footprinting of native proteins and mass spectrometry (MS)-based structural analysis. However, it remains challenging to realize peroxide-free photochemical oxidation footprinting. Herein, we describe the footprinting of native proteins by chloride-mediated peroxide-free photochemical oxidation of proteins (PPOP). The protein samples are prepared within biocompatible phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mM Gln as radical scavengers and oxidized in a capillary flow reactor directly under a single-pulse (10 ns) irradiation of a 193 nm ArF UV laser. The main oxidized protein residues are CMYWFHLI. We demonstrate that the PPOP-MS strategy is highly sensitive to the protein high-order structures and can be applied to monitor the protein-drug interfaces, which provides a promising footprinting alternative for protein structure-function explorations.
PXD012432	34965173	Identification of HnRNPC as a novel Tau exon 10 splicing factor using RNA antisense purification mass spectrometry. 	MSI-1 knockdown in MB002 medulloblastoma cell line	MSI-1, medulloblastoma	Alternative splicing in Tau exon 10 generates 3 R- and 4 R-Tau proteoforms, which have equal abundance in healthy adult human brain. Aberrant alternative splicing in Tau exon 10 leads to distortion of the balanced 3 R- and 4 R-Tau expression levels, which is a causal factor to trigger toxic Tau aggregation, neuron dysfunction and patient death in a group of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. Hence, identification of regulators upstream of the Tau exon 10 splicing events are crucial to understanding pathogenic mechanisms driving tauopathies. In this study, we used RNA Antisense Purification with Mass Spectrometry (RAP-MS) analysis to identify RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with the Tau pre-mRNA near exon 10. Among the newly identified RBP candidates, we show that knockdown of hnRNPC induces Tau exon 10 skipping whereas overexpression of hnRNPC promotes Tau exon 10 inclusion. In addition, we show that hnRNPC interacts with the poly-uridine (U-tract) sequences in introns 9 and 10 of Tau pre-mRNA. Mutation of these U-tract motifs abolished binding of hnRNPC with Tau pre-mRNA fragment and blocked its impact on Tau exon 10 inclusion. These findings indicate that hnRNPC binds and utilizes these U-tract motifs located in introns 9 and 10 of Tau pre-mRNA to promote Tau exon 10 inclusion. Intriguingly, high hnRNPC expression level is associated with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a sporadic tauopathy with pathological accumulation of Tau species that contain exon 10, which suggests a putative therapeutic role of hnRNPC for PSP treatment. [Figure: see text].
PXD028028	34965436	Phosphoproteomic responses of TORC1 target kinases reveal discrete and convergent mechanisms that orchestrate the quiescence program in yeast. 	Phosphoproteomic Responses of Distal TORC1 Target Kinases Reveal Discrete and Convergent Mechanisms that Orchestrate the Quiescence Program in Yeast	SILAC, kinase, phosphoproteomics	The eukaryotic TORC1 kinase assimilates diverse environmental cues, including growth factors and nutrients, to control growth by tuning anabolic and catabolic processes. In yeast, TORC1 stimulates protein synthesis in response to abundant nutrients primarily through its proximal effector kinase Sch9. Conversely, TORC1 inhibition following nutrient limitation unlocks various distally controlled kinases (e.g., Atg1, Gcn2, Npr1, Rim15, Slt2/Mpk1, and Yak1), which cooperate through poorly defined circuits to orchestrate the quiescence program. To better define the signaling landscape of the latter kinases, we use in vivo quantitative phosphoproteomics. Through pinpointing known and uncharted Npr1, Rim15, Slt2/Mpk1, and Yak1 effectors, our study examines the architecture of the distally controlled TORC1 kinase network. Accordingly, this is built on a combination of discrete, convergent, and multilayered feedback regulatory mechanisms, which likely ensure homeostatic control of and/or robust responses by TORC1 and its effector kinases under fluctuating nutritional conditions.
PXD014419	34966662	Effect of polyethylene glycol 20 000 on protein extraction efficiency of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues in South Africa. 	The effect of polyethylene glycol 20,000 on protein extraction efficiency of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues	000, Archival tissue, FFPE proteomics, PEG-20, SP3-on-bead-digestion, protein extraction	BACKGROUND: Optimal protocols for efficient and reproducible protein extraction from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are not yet standardised and new techniques are continually developed and improved. The effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 20 000 on protein extraction efficiency has not been evaluated using human FFPE colorectal cancer tissues and there is no consensus on the protein extraction solution required for efficient, reproducible extraction. OBJECTIVE: The impact of PEG 20 000 on protein extraction efficiency, reproducibility and protein selection bias was evaluated using FFPE colonic tissue via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis. METHODS: This study was conducted from August 2017 to July 2019 using human FFPE colorectal carcinoma tissues from the Anatomical Pathology department at Tygerberg Hospital in South Africa. Samples were analysed via label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to determine the impact of using PEG 20 000 in the protein extraction solution. Data were assessed regarding peptide and protein identifications, method efficiency, reproducibility, protein characteristics and organisation relating to gene ontology categories. RESULTS: Polyethylene glycol 20 000 exclusion increased peptides and proteins identifications and the method was more reproducible compared to the samples processed with PEG 20 000. However, no differences were observed with regard to protein selection bias. We found that higher protein concentrations (> 10 microg) compromised the function of PEG. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that protocols generating high protein yields from human FFPE tissues would benefit from the exclusion of PEG 20 000 in the protein extraction solution.
PXD028806	34966685	Extracellular Vesicles Induce an Aggressive Phenotype in Luminal Breast Cancer Cells Via PKM2 Phosphorylation. 	Quantitative proteomic analysis of co-cultured breast cancer cells	Breast Cancer, Co-culture, MB-MDA-231, MCF7	BACKGROUND: Aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of glucose metabolism in cancer. Previous studies have suggested that cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can modulate glucose metabolism in adjacent cells and promote disease progression. We hypothesized that EVs originating from cancer cells can modulate glucose metabolism in recipient cancer cells to induce cell proliferation and an aggressive cancer phenotype. METHODS: Two breast cancer cell lines with different levels of glycolytic activity, MDA-MB-231 cells of the claudin-low subtype and MCF7 cells of the luminal type, were selected and cocultured as the originating and recipient cells, respectively, using an indirect coculture system, such as a Transwell system or a microfluidic system. The [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake by the recipient MCF7 cells was assessed before and after coculture with MDA-MB-231 cells. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed to investigate the changes in gene expression patterns in the recipient MCF7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cell-derived EVs. RESULTS: FDG uptake by the recipient MCF7 cells significantly increased after coculture with MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, phosphorylation of PKM2 at tyrosine-105 and serine-37, which is necessary for tumorigenesis and aerobic glycolysis, was highly activated in cocultured MCF7 cells. Proteomic profiling revealed the proliferation and dedifferentiation of MCF7 cells following coculture with MDA-MB-231 cells. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated an increase in glycolysis in cocultured MCF7 cells, and the component analysis of glycolysis-related genes revealed that the second most abundant component after the cytoplasm was extracellular exosomes. In addition, proteomic analysis of EVs showed that the key proteins capable of phosphorylating PKM2 were present as cargo inside MDA-MB-231 cell-derived EVs. CONCLUSIONS: The phenomena observed in this study suggest that cancer cells can induce a phenotype transition of other subtypes to an aggressive phenotype to consequently activate glucose metabolism via EVs. Therefore, this study could serve as a cornerstone for further research on interactions between cancer cells.
PXD027912	34967612	Quantitative Accuracy and Precision in Multiplexed Single-Cell Proteomics. 	Quantitative accuracy and precision in multiplexed single-cell proteomics.	ProteomeXchange project tag: EPIC-XS, Single-cell proteomics, benchmarking	Single-cell proteomics workflows have considerably improved in sensitivity and reproducibility to characterize as-yet unknown biological phenomena. With the emergence of multiplexed single-cell proteomics, studies increasingly present single-cell measurements in conjunction with an abundant congruent carrier to improve the precursor selection and enhance identifications. While these extreme carrier spikes are often >100x more abundant than the investigated samples, the total ion current undoubtably increases but the quantitative accuracy possibly is affected. We here focus on narrowly titrated carrier spikes (i.e., <20x) and assess their elimination for a comparable sensitivity with superior accuracy. We find that subtle changes in the carrier ratio can severely impact the measurement variability and describe alternative multiplexing strategies to evaluate data quality. Lastly, we demonstrate elevated replicate overlap while preserving acquisition throughput at an improved quantitative accuracy with DIA-TMT and discuss optimized experimental designs for multiplexed proteomics of trace samples. This comprehensive benchmarking gives an overview of currently available techniques and guides the conceptualization of the optimal single-cell proteomics experiment.

Long term intrathecal administration of morphine vs baclofen: differences in CSF identified using multi-glycomics	CSF, intrathecal, long-term, morphine, multi-glycomics	Opioid use for treatment of persistent pain has increased dramatically over the past two decades, but it has not resulted in improved pain management outcomes. To understand the molecular mechanisms of opioids, molecular signatures that arise from opioid exposure are often sought after, using various analytical methods. In this study, we performed proteomics, and multiglycomics via sequential analysis of polysialic acids, glycosaminoglycans, N-glycans and O-glycans, using the same cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) sample from patients that had long-term (>2 years), intrathecal morphine or baclofen administered via an indwelling pump. Proteomics and N-glycomics signatures between the two treatment groups were highly conserved, while significant differences were observed in polysialic acid, heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan and O-glycan profiles between the two treatment groups. This represents the first study to investigate the potential relationships between diverse CSF conjugated glycans and long-term intrathecal drug exposure. The unique changes, observed by a sequential analytical workflow, reflect previously undescribed molecular effects of opioid administration and pain management.
PXD030372	34969852	Sod1 integrates oxygen availability to redox regulate NADPH production and the thiol redoxome. 	Sod1 Integrates Oxygen Availability to Redox Regulate NADPH Production and the Thiol Redoxome	glycolysis, oxygen sensing, pentose phosphate pathway, redox signailng, superoxide dismutase	Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod1) is a highly conserved and abundant antioxidant enzyme that detoxifies superoxide (O2(*-)) by catalyzing its conversion to dioxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells, we discovered that a major aspect of the antioxidant function of Sod1 is to integrate O2 availability to promote NADPH production. The mechanism involves Sod1-derived H2O2 oxidatively inactivating the glycolytic enzyme, GAPDH, which in turn reroutes carbohydrate flux to the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) to generate NADPH. The aerobic oxidation of GAPDH is dependent on and rate-limited by Sod1. Thus, Sod1 senses O2 via O2(*-) to balance glycolytic and oxPPP flux, through control of GAPDH activity, for adaptation to life in air. Importantly, this mechanism for Sod1 antioxidant activity requires the bulk of cellular Sod1, unlike for its role in protection against O2(*-) toxicity, which only requires <1% of total Sod1. Using mass spectrometry, we identified proteome-wide targets of Sod1-dependent redox signaling, including numerous metabolic enzymes. Altogether, Sod1-derived H2O2 is important for antioxidant defense and a master regulator of metabolism and the thiol redoxome.
PXD026677	34970140	The Attenuating Effect of Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound on Hypoxia-Induced Rat Chondrocyte Damage in TMJ Osteoarthritis Based on TMT Labeling Quantitative Proteomic Analysis. 	The attenuating effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on hypoxia-induced chondrocyte damage in TMJ osteoarthritis based on TMT labeling quantitative proteomic analysis	TMJOA, TMT labeling proteomics, chondrocyte, hypoxia, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS)	Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is a degenerative disease with a complex and multifactorial etiology. An increased intrajoint pressure or weakened penetration can exacerbate the hypoxic state of the condylar cartilage microenvironment. Our group previously simulated the hypoxic environment of TMJOA in vitro. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) stimulation attenuates chondrocyte matrix degradation via a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway-associated mechanism, but the mode of action of LIPUS is currently poorly understood. Moreover, most recent studies investigated the pathological mechanisms of osteoarthritis, but no biomarkers have been established for assessing the therapeutic effect of LIPUS on TMJOA with high specificity, which results in a lack of guidance regarding clinical application. Here, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic technology was used to comprehensively screen the molecular targets and pathways affected by the action of LIPUS on chondrocytes under hypoxic conditions. A bioinformatic analysis identified 902 and 131 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the <1% oxygen treatment group compared with the control group and in the <1% oxygen + LIPUS stimulation group compared with the <1% oxygen treatment group, respectively. The DEPs were analyzed by gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathway and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses. By acting on extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated proteins, LIPUS increases energy production and activates the FAK signaling pathway to regulate cell biological behaviors. DEPs of interest were selected to verify the reliability of the proteomic results. In addition, this experiment demonstrated that LIPUS could upregulate chondrogenic factors (such as Sox9, Collagen II and Aggrecan) and increase the mucin sulfate content. Moreover, LIPUS reduced the hydrolytic degradation of the ECM by decreasing the MMP3/TIMP1 ratio and vascularization by downregulating VEGF. Interestingly, LIPUS improved the migration ability of chondrocytes. In summary, LIPUS can regulate complex biological processes in chondrocytes under hypoxic conditions and alter the expression of many functional proteins, which results in reductions in hypoxia-induced chondrocyte damage. ECM proteins such as thrombospondin4, thrombospondin1, IL1RL1, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 1 play a central role and can be used as specific biomarkers determining the efficacy of LIPUS and viable clinical therapeutic targets of TMJOA.
PXD029445	34971423	Biophysical and biochemical properties of PHGDH revealed by studies on PHGDH inhibitors. 	Biophysical and biochemical properties of PHGDH revealed by studies on PHGDH inhibitors	PHGDH, oridonin	The rate-limiting serine biogenesis enzyme PHGDH is overexpressed in cancers. Both serine withdrawal and genetic/pharmacological inhibition of PHGDH have demonstrated promising tumor-suppressing activities. However, the enzyme properties of PHGDH are not well understood and the discovery of PHGDH inhibitors is still in its infancy. Here, oridonin was identified from a natural product library as a new PHGDH inhibitor. The crystal structure of PHGDH in complex with oridonin revealed a new allosteric site. The binding of oridonin to this site reduced the activity of the enzyme by relocating R54, a residue involved in substrate binding. Mutagenesis studies showed that PHGDH activity was very sensitive to cysteine mutations, especially those in the substrate binding domain. Conjugation of oridonin and other reported covalent PHGDH inhibitors to these sites will therefore inhibit PHGDH. In addition to being inhibited enzymatically, PHGDH can also be inhibited by protein aggregation and proteasome-mediated degradation. Several tested PHGDH cancer mutants showed altered enzymatic activity, which can be explained by protein structure and stability. Overall, the above studies present new biophysical and biochemical insights into PHGDH and may facilitate the future design of PHGDH inhibitors.
PXD027116	34973552	Comprehensive mass spectrometry for development of proteomic biomarkers of intracranial aneurysms. 	Comprehensive mass spectrometry strategy for developing proteomic biomarkers of intracranial aneurysms	biomarker, intracranial aneurysms	Protein biomarkers of intracranial aneurysm (IA) are essential for early detection and prediction of its rupture to facilitate the diagnosis and clinical management of the disease, monitor treatment response and detect recurrence. Here, we developed a comprehensive strategy for IA biomarker discovery by analyzing tissues from an animal model (n = 4) and serum from human patients (n = 60) using isobaric tandem mass tags-based quantitative proteomics. A total of 4811 and 562 proteins were identified from aneurysm tissue and serum samples, respectively. The 223 candidate protein biomarkers were further validated in an independent serum cohort (n = 30) by multiple reaction monitoring analysis. Combined with a logistic regression model, we built a diagnostic classifier P2 (FCN2 & RARRES2) to differentiate IA from healthy controls with accuracy of 93.3%, as well as a diagnostic classifier P7 (ADAM12, APOL3, F9, C3, CEACAM1, ICAM3, KLHDC7A) to classify ruptured IA from unruptured IA with accuracy of 95.0%. Taken together, our results suggest a valuable strategy for biomarker discovery and patient stratification in IA.
PXD027890	34975397	Capping Protein Regulator and Myosin 1 Linker 3 (CARMIL3) as a Molecular Signature of Ischemic Neurons in the DWI-T2 Mismatch Areas After Stroke. 	Mouse brain LC-MS data in DWI-T2 mismatch area after cerebral ischemia	DWI-T2 mismatch area, LC-MS, brain, ischemic stroke	Ischemic stroke with a mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) or T2-weighted images indicates onset within 4.5 h, but the pathological substrates in the DWI-T2 mismatch and T2(+) areas remain elusive. In this study, proteomics was used to explore (1) the protein expression profiles in the T2(+), mismatch, and contralateral areas, and (2) the protein with the highest expression in the T2(+) area in the brains of male Sprague-Dawley rats within 4.5 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The expression of the candidate protein was further validated in (1) rat brain subjected to MCAO, (2) rat primary cortical neuronal culture with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), and (3) infarcted human brain tissues. This study showed that apoptosis was observed in the T2(+) and mismatch regions and necroptosis in the T2(+) region of rat brains after MCAO. We identified capping protein regulator and myosin 1 linker 3 (CARMIL3) as the candidate molecule in the T2(+) and mismatch areas, exclusively in neurons, predominantly in the cytoplasm, and most abundant in the mismatch area. The CARMIL3(+) neurons and neurites in the mismatch and T2(+) areas were larger than those in the control area, and associated with (1) increased expression of sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1), indicating edema, (2) accumulation of p62, indicating impaired autophagy, and (3) increase in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), indicating oxidative stress. The increased expression of CARMIL3 was validated in a cell model of cortical neurons after OGD and in infarcted human brain tissues. In conclusion, this study shows that the mismatch and T2(+) areas within 4.5 h after ischemia are characterized by upregulated expression of CARMIL3 in neurons, particularly the mismatch area, which is associated with neuronal edema, impaired autophagy, and oxidative stress, indicating that CARMIL3 serves as a molecular signature of brain ischemia.
PXD030322	34975849	Characterization of Glycosylation-Specific Systemic and Mucosal IgA Antibody Responses to Escherichia coli Mucinase YghJ (SslE). 	BEMAP analysis of glycosylated TW10722 YghJ	BEMAP, E. coli, ETEC, YghJ	Efforts to develop broadly protective vaccines against pathogenic Escherichia coli are ongoing. A potential antigen candidate for vaccine development is the metalloprotease YghJ, or SslE. YghJ is a conserved mucinase that is immunogenic, heavily glycosylated, and produced by most pathogenic E. coli. To develop efficacious YghJ-based vaccines, there is a need to investigate to what extent potentially protective antibody responses target glycosylated epitopes in YghJ and to describe variations in the quality of YghJ glycosylation in the E. coli population. In this study we estimated the proportion of anti-YghJ IgA antibodies that targeted glycosylated epitopes in serum and intestinal lavage samples from 21 volunteers experimentally infected with wild-type enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strain TW10722. Glycosylated and non-glycosylated YghJ was expressed, purified, and then gycosylation pattern was verified by BEMAP analysis. Then we used a multiplex bead flow cytometric assay to analyse samples from before and 10 days after TW10722 was ingested. We found that 20 (95%) of the 21 volunteers had IgA antibody responses to homologous, glycosylated YghJ, with a median fold increase in IgA levels of 7.9 (interquartile range [IQR]: 7.1, 11.1) in serum and 3.7 (IQR: 2.1, 10.7) in lavage. The median proportion of anti-YghJ IgA response that specifically targeted glycosylated epitopes was 0.45 (IQR: 0.30, 0.59) in serum and 0.07 (IQR: 0.01, 0.22) in lavage. Our findings suggest that a substantial, but variable, proportion of the IgA antibody response to YghJ in serum during ETEC infection is targeted against glycosylated epitopes, but that gut IgA responses largely target non-glycosylated epitopes. Further research into IgA targeting glycosylated YghJ epitopes is of interest to the vaccine development efforts.
PXD028810	34977030	The Tongue Squamous Carcinoma Cell Line Cal27 Primarily Employs Integrin alpha6beta4-Containing Type II Hemidesmosomes for Adhesion Which Contribute to Anticancer Drug Sensitivity. 	The tongue squamous carcinoma cell line Cal27 primarily employs integrin alpha6beta4-containing type II hemidesmosomes for adhesion which contribute to anticancer drug sensitivity	adhesome, anticancer drug sensitivity, hemidesmosome, integrin crosstalk, integrin alpha6beta4, integrin alphaVbeta3, keratins 5/14, laminin-332	Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface glycoproteins used by cells to bind to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulate tumor cell proliferation, migration and survival. A causative relationship between integrin expression and resistance to anticancer drugs has been demonstrated in different tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Using a Cal27 tongue squamous cell carcinoma model, we have previously demonstrated that de novo expression of integrin alphaVbeta3 confers resistance to several anticancer drugs (cisplatin, mitomycin C and doxorubicin) through a mechanism involving downregulation of active Src, increased cell migration and invasion. In the integrin alphaVbeta3 expressing Cal27-derived cell clone 2B1, alphaVbeta5 expression was also increased, but unrelated to drug resistance. To identify the integrin adhesion complex (IAC) components that contribute to the changes in Cal27 and 2B1 cell adhesion and anticancer drug resistance, we isolated IACs from both cell lines. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics analysis indicated that both cell lines preferentially, but not exclusively, use integrin alpha6beta4, which is classically found in hemidesmosomes. The anticancer drug resistant cell clone 2B1 demonstrated an increased level of alpha6beta4 accompanied with increased deposition of a laminin-332-containing ECM. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy demonstrated the formation of type II hemidesmosomes by both cell types. Furthermore, suppression of alpha6beta4 expression in both lines conferred resistance to anticancer drugs through a mechanism independent of alphaVbeta3, which implies that the cell clone 2B1 would have been even more resistant had the upregulation of alpha6beta4 not occurred. Taken together, our results identify a key role for alpha6beta4-containing type II hemidesmosomes in regulating anticancer drug sensitivity.
PXD028042	34977057	Mosaic PKHD1 in Polycystic Kidneys Caused Aberrant Protein Expression in the Mitochondria and Lysosomes. 	Mosaic PKHD1 variants in polycystic kidney caused aberrant protein profiling of mitochondria and lysosomes	ARPKD, Exosome, Lysosome, Mitochondria, Mosaicism, PKHD1	Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a severe renal cystic disease caused mainly by the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1). However, the genetic cause, pathologic features, and mechanism of action of ARPKD are not well known. Here, we identified a family with ARPKD. Two siblings harbored biallelic variants in PKHD1 (c.7205G>A, c.7973T>A). We determined that the "de novo" variant, c.7205G>A, arose from the mosaicism of the father and had a 7.4% level. Pathologic characterization, using biopsy analysis, was evidenced with predominant cystic dilation in proximal tubules, slight ectasia of collecting ducts, defective ciliogenesis, and impaired cell-cell junctions in renal tubules and collecting ducts. Exosome proteomics in the urine from patients with ARPKD were markedly different from those of controls, with the most significant alterations occurring in mitochondrial and lysosomal proteins. Expression of the proteins of OXPHOS was downregulated sharply, in parallel with upregulated expression of the proteins involved in glycolysis in patients with ARPKD. Several lysosomal proteins associated with renal lesions were more abundant in the exosome of the patient than in controls. Moreover, the lysosomal enzyme sulfamidase, which is produced by the SGSH gene, was abrupt uniquely in the exosome of the patient. Consistently, swollen mitochondria and abundant lysosomes were visualized in the mutant tubular epithelial cells of patients with mutant PKHD1. Collectively, these findings provide new insights on the pathophysiology of the polycystic kidney due to PKHD1 deficiency. PKHD1 mosaicism should be considered in genetic testing of ARPKD patients.
PXD024991	34977152	Identification of DIR1-Dependant Cellular Responses in Guard Cell Systemic Acquired Resistance. 	Identification of DIR1-dependant cellular responses required for systemic acquired resistance in guard cells	guard cells, lipidomics, metabolomics	After localized invasion by bacterial pathogens, systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is induced in uninfected plant tissues, resulting in enhanced defense against a broad range of pathogens. Although SAR requires mobilization of signaling molecules via the plant vasculature, the specific molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The lipid transfer protein defective in induced resistance 1 (DIR1) was identified in Arabidopsis thaliana by screening for mutants that were defective in SAR. Here, we demonstrate that stomatal response to pathogens is altered in systemic leaves by SAR, and this guard cell SAR defense requires DIR1. Using a multi-omics approach, we have determined potential SAR signaling mechanisms specific for guard cells in systemic leaves by profiling metabolite, lipid, and protein differences between guard cells in the wild type and dir1-1 mutant during SAR. We identified two long-chain 18 C and 22 C fatty acids and two 16 C wax esters as putative SAR-related molecules dependent on DIR1. Proteins and metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis and response to stimulus were also changed in guard cells of dir1-1 compared to the wild type. Identification of guard cell-specific SAR-related molecules may lead to new avenues of genetic modification/molecular breeding for disease-resistant plants.
PXD029485	34977217	The Ovarian Development Genes of Bisexual and Parthenogenetic Haemaphysalis longicornis Evaluated by Transcriptomics and Proteomics. 	Proteome of parthenogenetic and bisexual ovarian tissues of Haemaphysalis longicornis at different feeding stages	Haemaphysalis longicornis, Ovarian	The tick Haemaphysalis longicornis has two reproductive groups: a bisexual group (HLBP) and a parthenogenetic group (HLPP). The comparative molecular regulation of ovarian development in these two groups is unexplored. We conducted transcriptome sequencing and quantitative proteomics on the ovaries of HLBP and HLPP, in different feeding stages, to evaluate the molecular function of genes associated with ovarian development. The ovarian tissues of HLBP and HLPP were divided into three feeding stages (early-fed, partially-fed and engorged). A total of 87,233 genes and 2,833 proteins were annotated in the ovary of H. longicornis in the different feeding stages. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of functional pathway analysis indicated that Lysosome, MAPK Signaling Pathway, Phagosome, Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton, Endocytosis, Apoptosis, Insulin Signaling Pathway, Oxidative Phosphorylation, and Sphingolipid Metabolism were most abundant in the ovary of H. longicornis in the different feeding stages. Comparing the DEGs between HLBP and HLPP revealed that the ABC Transporter, PI3K-Akt Signaling Pathway and cAMP Signaling Pathway were the most enriched and suggested that the functions of signal transduction mechanisms may have changed during ovarian development. The functions of the annotated proteome of ovarian tissues were strongly correlated with the transcriptome annotation results, and these were further validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In the HLBP, the expression of cathepsin L, secreted proteins and glycosidase proteins was significantly up-regulated during feeding stages. In the HLPP, the lysozyme, yolk proteins, heat shock protein, glutathione S transferase, myosin and ATP synthase proteins were up-regulated during feeding stages. The significant differences of the gene expression between HLBP and HLPP indicated that variations in the genetic background and molecular function might exist in the two groups. These results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanism and exploring the functions of genes in the ovarian development of different reproductive groups of H. longicornis.
PXD028574	34978130	Comparative genomics and proteomics of Eubacterium maltosivorans: functional identification of trimethylamine methyltransferases and bacterial microcompartments in a human intestinal bacterium with a versatile lifestyle. 	Comparative proteomics of Eubacterium maltosivorans: Functional identification of trimethylamine methyltransferases and bacterial microcompartments in a human intestinal bacterium	Eubacterium maltosivorans, TMAO, deamination, methyltransferase, microcompartments, quaternary amines	Eubacterium maltosivorans YI(T) is a human intestinal isolate capable of acetogenic, propionogenic and butyrogenic growth. Its 4.3-Mb genome sequence contains coding sequences for 4227 proteins, including 41 different methyltransferases. Comparative proteomics of strain YI(T) showed the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway proteins to be actively produced during homoacetogenic growth on H2 and CO2 while butyrogenic growth on a mixture of lactate and acetate significantly upregulated the production of proteins encoded by the recently identified lctABCDEF cluster and accessory proteins. Growth on H2 and CO2 unexpectedly induced the production of two related trimethylamine methyltransferases. Moreover, a set of 16 different trimethylamine methyltransferases together with proteins for bacterial microcompartments were produced during growth and deamination of the quaternary amines, betaine, carnitine and choline. Growth of strain YI(T) on 1,2-propanediol generated propionate with propanol and induced the formation of bacterial microcompartments that were also prominently visible in betaine-grown cells. The present study demonstrates that E. maltosivorans is highly versatile in converting low-energy fermentation end-products in the human gut into butyrate and propionate whilst being capable of preventing the formation of the undesired trimethylamine by converting betaine and other quaternary amines in bacterial microcompartments into acetate and butyrate.
PXD024615	34978375	Circulating proteomic panels for risk stratification of intracranial aneurysm and its rupture. 	Circulating proteomic panels for risk stratification of intracranial aneurysm and its rupture	biomarker discover, intracranial aneurysm, serum proteome profiling	The prevalence of intracranial aneurysm (IA) is increasing, and the consequences of its rupture are severe. This study aimed to reveal specific, sensitive, and non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis and classification of ruptured and unruptured IA, to benefit the development of novel treatment strategies and therapeutics altering the course of the disease. We first assembled an extensive candidate biomarker bank of IA, comprising up to 717 proteins, based on altered proteins discovered in the current tissue and serum proteomic analysis, as well as from previous studies. Mass spectrometry assays for hundreds of biomarkers were efficiently designed using our proposed deep learning-based method, termed DeepPRM. A total of 113 potential markers were further quantitated in serum cohort I (n = 212) & II (n = 32). Combined with a machine-learning-based pipeline, we built two sets of biomarker combinations (P6 & P8) to accurately distinguish IA from healthy controls (accuracy: 87.50%) or classify IA rupture patients (accuracy: 91.67%) upon evaluation in the external validation set (n = 32). This extensive circulating biomarker development study provides valuable knowledge about IA biomarkers.
PXD028363	34980145	TMT-based quantitative proteomic profiling of human monocyte-derived macrophages and foam cells. 	TMT-based quantitative proteomic profiling of human monocytes derived macrophage and foam cell	Atherosclerosis, foam cell, macrophage	BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, most of which are caused by atherosclerosis. Discerning processes that participate in macrophage-to-foam cell formation are critical for understanding the basic mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis. To explore the molecular mechanisms of foam cell formation, differentially expressed proteins were identified. METHODS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and obtained macrophages were transformed into foam cells by oxidized low-density lipoprotein. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling combined with mass spectrometry was performed to find associations between foam cell transformation and proteome profiles. RESULTS: Totally, 5146 quantifiable proteins were identified, among which 1515 and 182 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found in macrophage/monocyte and foam cell/macrophage, respectively. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that downregulated DEPs of macrophages/monocytes were mostly located in the nucleus, whereas upregulated DEPs of foam cells/macrophages were mostly extracellular or located in the plasma membrane. Functional analysis of DEPs demonstrated that cholesterol metabolism-related proteins were upregulated in foam cells, whereas immune response-related proteins were downregulated in foam cells. The protein interaction network showed that the DEPs with the highest interaction scores between macrophages and foam cells were mainly concentrated in lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum. CONCLUSIONS: Proteomics analysis suggested that cholesterol metabolism was upregulated, while the immune response was suppressed in foam cells. KEGG enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis indicated that DEPs located in the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes might be key drivers of foam cell formation. These data provide a basis for identifying the potential proteins associated with the molecular mechanism underlying macrophage transformation to foam cells.
PXD015048	34983537	CircRTN4 promotes pancreatic cancer progression through a novel CircRNA-miRNA-lncRNA pathway and stabilizing epithelial-mesenchymal transition protein. 	Identification of circRNA-interacting proteins in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	circFOXK2, circGANAB, circRNA-interacting proteins, circRTN4, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	BACKGROUND: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in many biological processes. However, the detailed mechanism underlying the critical roles of circRNAs in cancer remains largely unexplored. We aim to explore the molecular mechanisms of circRTN4 with critical roles in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). METHODS: CircRTN4 expression level was examined in PDAC primary tumors. The oncogenic roles of circRTN4 in PDAC tumor growth and metastasis were studied in mouse tumor models. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase assay and miRNA pulldown assay were performed to study the novel circRTN4-miRNA-lncRNA pathway. To identify circRTN4-interacting proteins, we performed circRNA-pulldown and mass spectrometry in PDAC cells. Protein stability assay and 3-Dimensional structure modeling were performed to reveal the role of circRTN4 in stabilizing RAB11FIP1. RESULTS: CircRTN4 was significantly upregulated in primary tumors from PDAC patients. In vitro and in vivo functional studies revealed that circRTN4 promoted PDAC tumor growth and liver metastasis. Mechanistically, circRTN4 interacted with tumor suppressor miR-497-5p in PDAC cells. CircRTN4 knockdown upregulated miR-497-5p to inhibit the oncogenic lncRNA HOTTIP expression. Furthermore, we identified critical circRTN4-intercting proteins by circRNA-pulldown in PDAC cells. CircRTN4 interacted with important epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)- driver RAB11FIP1 to block its ubiquitination site. We found that circRTN4 knockdown promoted the degradation of RAB11FIP1 by increasing its ubiquitination. Also, circRTN4 knockdown inhibited the expression of RAB11FIP1-regulating EMT-markers Slug, Snai1, Twist, Zeb1 and N-cadherin in PDAC. CONCLUSION: The upregulated circRTN4 promotes tumor growth and liver metastasis in PDAC through the novel circRTN4-miR-497-5p-HOTTIP pathway. Also, circRTN4 stabilizes RAB11FIP1 to contribute EMT.
PXD030457	34983847	Proteomics of isolated sieve tubes from Nicotiana tabacum: sieve element-specific proteins reveal differentiation of the endomembrane system. 	Proteomics of isolated sieve tubes from N.tabacum	n.tabacum, sieve tubes	Symplasmicly connected cells called sieve elements form a network of tubes in the phloem of vascular plants. Sieve elements have essential functions as they provide routes for photoassimilate distribution, the exchange of developmental signals, and the coordination of defense responses. Nonetheless, they are the least understood main type of plant cells. They are extremely sensitive, possess a reduced endomembrane system without Golgi apparatus, and lack nuclei and translation machineries, so that transcriptomics and similar techniques cannot be applied. Moreover, the analysis of phloem exudates as a proxy for sieve element composition is marred by methodological problems. We developed a simple protocol for the isolation of sieve elements from leaves and stems of Nicotiana tabacum at sufficient amounts for large-scale proteome analysis. By quantifying the enrichment of individual proteins in purified sieve element relative to bulk phloem preparations, proteins of increased likelyhood to function specifically in sieve elements were identified. To evaluate the validity of this approach, yellow fluorescent protein constructs of genes encoding three of the candidate proteins were expressed in plants. Tagged proteins occurred exclusively in sieve elements. Two of them, a putative cytochrome b561/ferric reductase and a reticulon-like protein, appeared restricted to segments of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that were inaccessible to green fluorescent protein dissolved in the ER lumen, suggesting a previously unknown differentiation of the endomembrane system in sieve elements. Evidently, our list of promising candidate proteins ( SI Appendix, Table S1) provides a valuable exploratory tool for sieve element biology.
PXD015115	34984269	Spinal Muscular Atrophy Patient iPSC-Derived Motor Neurons Display Altered Proteomes at Early Stages of Differentiation. 	Spinal Muscular Atrophy Patient iPSC-derived Motor Neurons Display Altered Proteins at Early Stages of Differentiation	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), TMT-10plex, iPSC, neuron differentiation, quantitative mass spectrometry	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of motor neurons (MN) in the spinal cord leading to progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. SMA is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, resulting in reduced levels of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The mechanisms that link SMN deficiency to selective motor neuron dysfunction in SMA remain largely unknown. We present here, for the first time, a comprehensive quantitative TMT-10plex proteomics analysis that covers the development of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MNs from both healthy individuals and SMA patients. We show that the proteomes of SMA samples segregate from controls already at early stages of neuronal differentiation. The altered proteomic signature in SMA MNs is associated with mRNA splicing, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, organelle organization, cellular biogenesis, and metabolic processes. We highlight several known SMN-binding partners and evaluate their expression changes during MN differentiation. In addition, we compared our study to human and mouse in vivo proteomic studies revealing distinct and similar signatures. Altogether, our work provides a comprehensive resource of molecular events during early stages of MN differentiation, containing potentially therapeutically interesting protein expression profiles for SMA.
PXD049377	34984927	Differentiating children with sepsis with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome using proteomics. 	Differentiating children with sepsis with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome using proteomics	DNA-bound proteins, Neutrophil, Nucleosome, Sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome	Both sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) rely on imprecise clinical definitions leading to heterogeneity, which has contributed to negative trials. Because circulating protein/DNA complexes have been implicated in sepsis and ARDS, we aimed to develop a proteomic signature of DNA-bound proteins to discriminate between children with sepsis with and without ARDS. We performed a prospective case-control study in 12 children with sepsis with ARDS matched to 12 children with sepsis without ARDS on age, severity of illness score, and source of infection. We performed co-immunoprecipitation and downstream proteomics in plasma collected <= 24 h of intensive care unit admission. Expression profiles were generated, and a random forest classifier was used on differentially expressed proteins to develop a signature which discriminated ARDS. The classifier was tested in six independent blinded samples. Neutrophil and nucleosome proteins were over-represented in ARDS, including two S100A proteins, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and three histones. Random forest produced a 10-protein signature that accurately discriminated between children with sepsis with and without ARDS. This classifier perfectly assigned six independent blinded samples as having ARDS or not. We validated higher expression of the most informative discriminating protein, galectin-3-binding protein, in children with ARDS. Our methodology has applicability to isolation of DNA-bound proteins from plasma. Our results support the premise of a molecular definition of ARDS, and give preliminary insight into why some children with sepsis, but not others, develop ARDS.
PXD028120	34985300	Characterization of the O-Glycoproteome of Porphyromonas gingivalis. 	O-glycoproteome of Porphyromonas gingivalis	O-glycosylation, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, glycan biosynthesis	Porphyromonas gingivalis is an important human pathogen and also a model organism for the Bacteroidetes phylum. O-glycosylation has been reported in this phylum with findings that include the O-glycosylation motif, the structure of the O-glycans in a few species, and an extensive O-glycoproteome analysis in Tannerella forsythia. However, O-glycosylation has not yet been confirmed in P. gingivalis. We therefore used glycoproteomics approaches including partial deglycosylation with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as well as both HILIC and FAIMS based glycopeptide enrichment strategies leading to the identification of 257 putative glycosylation sites in 145 glycoproteins. The sequence of the major O-glycan was elucidated to be HexNAc-HexNAc(P-Gro-[Ac]0-2)-dHex-Hex-HexA-Hex(dHex). Western blot analyses of mutants lacking the glycosyltransferases PGN_1134 and PGN_1135 demonstrated their involvement in the biosynthesis of the glycan while mass spectrometry analysis of the truncated O-glycans suggested that PGN_1134 and PGN_1135 transfer the two HexNAc sugars. Interestingly, a strong bias against the O-glycosylation of abundant proteins exposed to the cell surface such as abundant T9SS cargo proteins, surface lipoproteins, and outer membrane beta-barrel proteins was observed. In contrast, the great majority of proteins associated with the inner membrane or periplasm were glycosylated irrespective of their abundance. The P. gingivalis O-glycosylation system may therefore function to establish the desired physicochemical properties of the periplasm. IMPORTANCE Porphyromonas gingivalis is an oral pathogen primarily associated with severe periodontal disease and further associated with rheumatoid arthritis, dementia, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. Protein glycosylation can be important for a variety of reasons including protein function, solubility, protease resistance, and thermodynamic stability. This study has for the first time demonstrated the presence of O-linked glycosylation in this organism by determining the basic structure of the O-glycans and identifying 257 glycosylation sites in 145 proteins. It was found that most proteins exposed to the periplasm were O-glycosylated; however, the abundant surface exposed proteins were not. The O-glycans consisted of seven monosaccharides and a glycerol phosphate with 0-2 acetyl groups. These glycans are likely to have a stabilizing role to the proteins that bear them and must be taken into account when the proteins are produced in heterologous organisms.
PXD027334	34985858	Peroxide Antimalarial Drugs Target Redox Homeostasis in Plasmodium falciparum Infected Red Blood Cells. 	Peroxide antimalarial drugs impact redox homeostasis in Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells	Glutathione., Malaria, Ozonides, Peroxides, Plasmodium falciparum, Redox homeostasis	Plasmodium falciparum causes the most lethal form of malaria. Peroxide antimalarials based on artemisinin underpin the frontline treatments for malaria, but artemisinin resistance is rapidly spreading. Synthetic peroxide antimalarials, known as ozonides, are in clinical development and offer a potential alternative. Here, we used chemoproteomics to investigate the protein alkylation targets of artemisinin and ozonide probes, including an analogue of the ozonide clinical candidate, artefenomel. We greatly expanded the list of proteins alkylated by peroxide antimalarials and identified significant enrichment of redox-related proteins for both artemisinins and ozonides. Disrupted redox homeostasis was confirmed by dynamic live imaging of the glutathione redox potential using a genetically encoded redox-sensitive fluorescence-based biosensor. Targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based thiol metabolomics also confirmed changes in cellular thiol levels. This work shows that peroxide antimalarials disproportionately alkylate proteins involved in redox homeostasis and that disrupted redox processes are involved in the mechanism of action of these important antimalarials.
PXD027578	34986311	Quantitative Chemoproteomic Profiling with Data-Independent Acquisition-Based Mass Spectrometry. 	Quantitative Chemoproteomic Profiling with Data-Independent Acquisition-based Mass Spectrometry	Activity-based protein profiling, Data-Independent acquisition	Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool to enable annotation of protein functions and discovery of targets of bioactive ligands in complex biological systems. It utilizes chemical probes to covalently label functional sites in proteins so that they can be enriched for mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics analysis. However, the semistochastic nature of data-dependent acquisition and high cost associated with isotopically encoded quantification reagents compromise the power of ABPP in multidimensional analysis and high-throughput screening, when a large number of samples need to be quantified in parallel. Here, we combine the data-independent acquisition (DIA) MS with ABPP to develop an efficient label-free quantitative chemical proteomic method, DIA-ABPP, with good reproducibility and high accuracy for high-throughput quantification. We demonstrated the power of DIA-ABPP for comprehensive profiling of functional cysteineome in three distinct applications, including dose-dependent quantification of cysteines' sensitivity toward a reactive metabolite, screening of ligandable cysteines with a covalent fragment library, and profiling of cysteinome fluctuation in circadian clock cycles. DIA-ABPP will open new opportunities for in-depth and multidimensional profiling of functional proteomes and interactions with bioactive small molecules in complex biological systems.
PXD029475	34986318	Clostridioides difficile Phosphoproteomics Shows an Expansion of Phosphorylated Proteins in Stationary Growth Phase. 	Clostridioides difficile phosphoproteomics  shows an expansion of  phosphorylated proteins in stationary growth phase	Clostridioides difficile, phosphoproteomics	Phosphorylation is a posttranslational modification that can affect both housekeeping functions and virulence characteristics in bacterial pathogens. In the Gram-positive enteropathogen Clostridioides difficile, the extent and nature of phosphorylation events are poorly characterized, though a protein kinase mutant strain demonstrates pleiotropic phenotypes. Here, we used an immobilized metal affinity chromatography strategy to characterize serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation in C. difficile. We find limited protein phosphorylation in the exponential growth phase but a sharp increase in the number of phosphopeptides after the onset of the stationary growth phase. Our approach identifies expected targets and phosphorylation sites among the more than 1,500 phosphosites, including the protein kinase PrkC, the anti-sigma-F factor antagonist (SpoIIAA), the anti-sigma-B factor antagonist (RsbV), and HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HprK). Analysis of high-confidence phosphosites shows that phosphorylation on serine residues is most common, followed by threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation. This work forms the basis for a further investigation into the contributions of individual kinases to the overall phosphoproteome of C. difficile and the role of phosphorylation in C. difficile physiology and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of protein phosphorylation in the Gram-positive enteropathogen Clostridioides difficile. To date, only limited evidence on the role of phosphorylation in the regulation of this organism has been published; the current study is expected to form the basis for research on this posttranslational modification in C. difficile.  .
PXD021983	34986323	Pocket delipidation induced by membrane tension or modification leads to a structurally analogous mechanosensitive channel state. 	Tension mediated mechanical activation and pocket delipidation lead to an analogous MscL channel state	HDX-MS, MscL, mechanosensation, tension	The mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance MscL gates in response to membrane tension changes. Lipid removal from transmembrane pockets leads to a concerted structural and functional MscL response, but it remains unknown whether there is a correlation between the tension-mediated state and the state derived by pocket delipidation in the absence of tension. Here, we combined pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, coupled with molecular dynamics simulations under membrane tension, to investigate the structural changes associated with the distinctively derived states. Whether it is tension- or modification-mediated pocket delipidation, we find that MscL samples a similar expanded subconducting state. This is the final step of the delipidation pathway, but only an intermediate stop on the tension-mediated path, with additional tension triggering further channel opening. Our findings hint at synergistic modes of regulation by lipid molecules in membrane tension-activated mechanosensitive channels.
PXD027774	34988080	The Aquatic Invertebrate Hydra vulgaris Releases Molecular Messages Through Extracellular Vesicles. 	Hydra vulgaris extracellular vesicles	Hydra vulgaris, LC-ESI-MS/MS, extracellular vesicles	Recent body of evidence demonstrates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent the first language of cell-cell communication emerged during evolution. In aquatic environments, transferring signals between cells by EVs offers protection against degradation, allowing delivering of chemical information in high local concentrations to the target cells. The packaging of multiple signals, including those of hydrophobic nature, ensures target cells to receive the same EV-conveyed messages, and the coordination of a variety of physiological processes across cells of a single organisms, or at the population level, i.e., mediating the population's response to changing environmental conditions. Here, we purified EVs from the medium of the freshwater invertebrate Hydra vulgaris, and the molecular profiling by proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed multiple markers of the exosome EV subtype, from structural proteins to stress induced messages promoting cell survival. Moreover, positive and negative regulators of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, the major developmental pathway acting in body axial patterning, were identified. Functional analysis on amputated polyps revealed EV ability to modulate both head and foot regeneration, suggesting bioactivity of the EV cargo and opening new perspectives on the mechanisms of developmental signalling. Our results open the path to unravel EV biogenesis and function in all cnidarian species, tracing back the origin of the cell-cell, cross-species or cross-kingdom communication in aquatic ecosystems.
PXD027001	34988201	Identification of ubiquitinated substrate proteins and their gene expression patterns in lung adenocarcinoma. 	Identification of ubiquitinated proteins in lung adenocarcinoma and normal lung tissues	Ubiquitylome, lung adenocarcinoma	BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a malignant disease with the highest cancer-related mortality rate. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), protein ubiquitination can regulate multiple biological processes. A LUAD ubiquitylome analysis has not yet been reported. METHODS: We used for the first time ion mobility into liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to perform accurate and reliable ubiquitylome and proteomic analysis of clinical LUAD and normal tissues and combined it with transcriptome data obtained from public databases. Ubiquitinated protein substrates and their gene expression pattern landscapes in LUAD were identified using bioinformatics methods. RESULTS: Our data revealed a ubiquitination landscape in LUAD and identified characteristic protein ubiquitination motifs. We found that the ubiquitinated peptide motifs in LUAD were completely different from those of previously published lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Moreover, we identified two gene expression patterns of ubiquitinated proteins and revealed that survival differences between these patterns may be correlated with the tumor immune infiltrating microenvironment. Finally, we constructed a prognostic predictive model to quantify the relationship between expression patterns and survival. We found a relationship between the patient-applied model score and multiple drug sensitivity. Therefore, our model can serve as a guide for LUAD clinical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our work addresses the lack of ubiquitylome studies in LUAD and provides new perspectives for subsequent research and clinical treatment.
PXD011791	34988408	Amino acid primed mTOR activity is essential for heart regeneration. 	Amino acid priming of mTOR is essential for heart regeneration	Heart Regeneration, mTOR	Heart disease is the leading cause of death with no method to repair damaged myocardium due to the limited proliferative capacity of adult cardiomyocytes. Curiously, mouse neonates and zebrafish can regenerate their hearts via cardiomyocyte de-differentiation and proliferation. However, a molecular mechanism of why these cardiomyocytes can re-enter cell cycle is poorly understood. Here, we identify a unique metabolic state that primes adult zebrafish and neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes to proliferate. Zebrafish and neonatal mouse hearts display elevated glutamine levels, predisposing them to amino-acid-driven activation of TOR, and that TOR activation is required for zebrafish cardiomyocyte regeneration in vivo. Through a multi-omics approach with cellular validation we identify metabolic and mitochondrial changes during the first week of regeneration. These data suggest that regeneration of zebrafish myocardium is driven by metabolic remodeling and reveals a unique metabolic regulator, TOR-primed state, in which zebrafish and mammalian cardiomyocytes are regeneration competent.
PXD030257	34989730	Multi-omic characterisation of Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 30439: detailed assessment of its secondary metabolic potential. 	Multi-omic characterisation of Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 30439: detailed assessment of its secondary metabolic potential	Streptomyces, hygroscopicus, inhibens, intracellular, secondary metabolism, timecourse	The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria creates a demand for novel antibiotics with distinct mechanisms of action. Advances in next-generation genome sequencing promised a paradigm shift in the quest to find new bioactive secondary metabolites. Genome mining has proven successful for predicting putative biosynthetic elements in secondary metabolite superproducers such as Streptomycetes. However, genome mining approaches do not inform whether biosynthetic gene clusters are dormant or active under given culture conditions. Here we show that using a multi-omics approach in combination with antiSMASH, it is possible to assess the secondary metabolic potential of a Streptomyces strain capable of producing mannopeptimycin, an important cyclic peptide effective against Gram-positive infections. The genome of Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 30439 was first sequenced using PacBio RSII to obtain a closed genome. A chemically defined medium was then used to elicit a nutrient stress response in S. hygroscopicus NRRL 30439. Detailed extracellular metabolomics and intracellular proteomics were used to profile and segregate primary and secondary metabolism. Our results demonstrate that the combination of genomics, proteomics and metabolomics enables rapid evaluation of a strain's performance in bioreactors for industrial production of secondary metabolites.
PXD026841	34990654	Protection of the Prodomain alpha1-Helix Correlates with Latency in the Transforming Growth Factor-beta Family. 	Protection of the prodomain alpha1-helix correlates with latency in the transforming growth factor-beta family	Activin, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), electron microscopy (EM), hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry, transforming growth factor beta (TGFâ€beta)	The 33 members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family are fundamentally important for organismal development and homeostasis. Family members are synthesized and secreted as pro-complexes of non-covalently associated prodomains and growth factors (GF). Pro-complexes from a subset of family members are latent and require activation steps to release the GF for signaling. Why some members are latent while others are non-latent is incompletely understood, particularly because of large family diversity. Here, we have examined representative family members in negative stain electron microscopy (nsEM) and hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) to identify features that differentiate latent from non-latent members. nsEM showed three overall pro-complex conformations that differed in prodomain arm domain orientation relative to the bound growth factor. Two cross-armed members, TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2, were each latent. However, among V-armed members, GDF8 was latent whereas ActA was not. All open-armed members, BMP7, BMP9, and BMP10, were non-latent. Family members exhibited remarkably varying HDX patterns, consistent with large prodomain sequence divergence. A strong correlation emerged between latency and protection of the prodomain alpha1-helix from exchange. Furthermore, latency and protection from exchange correlated structurally with increased alpha1-helix buried surface area, hydrogen bonds, and cation-pi bonds. Moreover, a specific pattern of conserved basic and hydrophobic residues in the alpha1-helix and aromatic residues in the interacting fastener were found only in latent members. Thus, this first comparative survey of TGF-beta family members reveals not only diversity in conformation and dynamics but also unique features that distinguish latent members.
PXD026637	34990820	Getting more out of FLAG-Tag co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry experiments using FAIMS. 	Getting more out of co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry experiments by reducing interference using FAIMS	Co-IP mass spectrometry, FAIMS, ion mobility	Co-immunoprecipitation of proteins coupled to mass spectrometry is critical for the understanding of protein interaction networks. In instances where a suitable antibody is not available, it is common to graft synthetic tags onto a target protein sequence thereby allowing the use of commercially available antibodies for affinity purification. A common approach is through FLAG-Tag co-immunoprecipitation. To allow the selective elution of protein complexes, competitive displacement using a large molar excess of the tag peptides is often carried out. Yet, this creates downstream challenges for the mass spectrometry analysis due to the presence of large quantities of these peptides. Here, we demonstrate that Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry (FAIMS), a gas phase ion separation device prior to mass spectrometry analysis can be applied to FLAG-Tag co-immunoprecipitation experiments to increase the depth of protein coverage. By excluding these abundant tag peptides, we were able to observe deeper coverage of interacting proteins and as a result, deeper biological insights, without the need for additional sample handling or altering sample preparation protocols. SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown that application of FAIMS separation in the gas phase can increase the proteome coverage of Flag-Tagged co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry experiments versus one without FAIMS. We were able to observe deeper coverage of interacting proteins and as a result, deeper biological insights, without additional sample handling, fractionation, machine run time or modifying the sample preparation protocol.
PXD028695	34990822	Integrated analysis of the sialotranscriptome and sialoproteome of the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis. 	Integrated analysis of the sialotrancriptome and sialoproteome of the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis.	Flea, sliavary glands, transcriptome	Over the last 20 years, advances in sequencing technologies paired with biochemical and structural studies have shed light on the unique pharmacological arsenal produced by the salivary glands of hematophagous arthropods that can target host hemostasis and immune response, favoring blood acquisition and, in several cases, enhancing pathogen transmission. Here we provide a deeper insight into Xenopsylla cheopis salivary gland contents pairing transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Sequencing of 99 pairs of salivary glands from adult female X. cheopis yielded a total of 7432 coding sequences functionally classified into 25 classes, of which the secreted protein class was the largest. The translated transcripts also served as a reference database for the proteomic study, which identified peptides from 610 different proteins. Both approaches revealed that the acid phosphatase family is the most abundant salivary protein group from X. cheopis. Additionally, we report here novel sequences similar to the FS-H family, apyrases, odorant and hormone-binding proteins, antigen 5-like proteins, adenosine deaminases, peptidase inhibitors from different subfamilies, proteins rich in Glu, Gly, and Pro residues, and several potential secreted proteins with unknown function. SIGNIFICANCE: The rat flea X. cheopis is the main vector of Yersinia pestis, the etiological agent of the bubonic plague responsible for three major pandemics that marked human history and remains a burden to human health. In addition to Y. pestis fleas can also transmit other medically relevant pathogens including Rickettsia spp. and Bartonella spp. The studies of salivary proteins from other hematophagous vectors highlighted the importance of such molecules for blood acquisition and pathogen transmission. However, despite the historical and clinical importance of X. cheopis little is known regarding their salivary gland contents and potential activities. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of X. cheopis salivary composition using next generation sequencing methods paired with LC-MS/MS analysis, revealing its unique composition compared to the sialomes of other blood-feeding arthropods, and highlighting the different pathways taken during the evolution of salivary gland concoctions. In the absence of the X. cheopis genome sequence, this work serves as an extended reference for the identification of potential pharmacological proteins and peptides present in flea saliva.
PXD024049	34991685	Replication and transcription machinery for ranaviruses: components, correlation, and functional architecture. 	Identification of replication and transcription machinery for cross species infectious ranaviruses	isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND), recombinant virus-based affinity purification, replication and transcription machinery	BACKGROUND: Ranaviruses (family Iridoviridae) are promiscuous pathogens that can infect across species barriers in poikilotherms and can replicate in amphibian and fish cells and even in cultured mammalian cells. However, as nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs), their replication and transcription mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we screened and uncovered the replication and transcription machinery of two ranaviruses, Andrias davidianus ranavirus (ADRV) and Rana grylio virus (RGV), by a combination of methods, including the isolation of proteins on nascent DNA, recombinant virus-based affinity, and NanoLuc complementation assay. RESULTS: The ranavirus replication and transcription machinery was deeply dissected and identified as a complicated apparatus containing at least 30 viral and 6 host proteins. The viral proteins ADRV-47L/RGV-63R (DNA polymerase, vDPOL), ADRV-23L/RGV-91R (proliferating cell nuclear antigen, vPCNA), ADRV-85L/RGV-27R (single-stranded DNA binding protein, vSSB), ADRV-88L/RGV-24R (vhelicase/primase), etc., constitute the core replisome. Specifically, the core of the transcription complex, the viral RNA polymerase, contain the host RNAPII subunits Rpb3, Rpb6, and Rpb11, which was a first report in NCLDVs. Furthermore, correlations and interactions among these factors in the machinery were described. Significantly, the replisome core protein vDPOL (ADRV-47L) can interact with numerous viral and host proteins and could act as a linker and regulation center in viral DNA replication and transcription. Thus, these results depicted an architecture for ranavirus replication and transcription. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 36 components from ranavirus and their host were found to form viral replisomes and transcription complexes using a series of precise methods, which further constructed an architecture for ranavirus replication and transcription in which vDPOL was a key central factor and various components correlated and cooperated. Therefore, it provides a cornerstone for further understanding the mechanisms of the replication and transcription of ranaviruses which can ensure the efficient production of progeny virus and adaptation to cross-species infection.
PXD026106	34992424	Alterations of Asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA)-Containing Protein Profiles Associated with Chronic Pancreatitis Pathogenesis. 	Asymmetric dimethylarginine proteome in chronic pancreatitis	ADMA, Chronic pancreatitis, clinical samples	OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic pancreatitis (CP) still remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to characterize asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)-containing proteins in pancreatic tissues and its relationship with CP pathogenesis. METHODS: Totally 36 patients with CP were enrolled in this study. Seven other cholangiocarcinoma patients without pancreas involvements or patients with benign pancreatic tumors were included as the control group. Total proteins in human pancreatic tissues were digested by trypsin, and ADMA-containing peptides were enriched via immunoaffinity purification. The LC-MS/MS was performed to characterize ADMA-containing peptides and their modification sites in CP tissues. Relative asymmetric arginine dimethylation levels of HNRNPA3 proteins in human pancreatic tissues were detected by the immunoprecipitation combined with Western blot. The serum inflammatory factors were determined via the ELISA method. RESULTS: A total of 134 ADMA sites in the control group and 137 ADMA sites in CP tissues were characterized by mass spectrometry, which belong to 93 and 94 ADMA-containing proteins in the control group and CP tissues, respectively. Glycine and proline residues were significantly overrepresented in the flanking sequences of ADMA sites. ADMA-containing proteins in the CP tissues were associated with various biological processes, especially the RNA metabolism and splicing pathways. Multiple protein members of the spliceosome pathway such as HNRNPA3 possess ADMA sites in the CP tissues. HNRNPA3 dimethylation levels were greatly increased in CP tissues, which were positively correlated with inflammatory factors. CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of CP is associated with alterations of asymmetric arginine dimethylation in pancreatic tissues.
PXD028779	34993140	Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Plasma Exosomes to Identify the Candidate Biomarker of Imatinib Resistance in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients. 	Quantitative proteomic analysis of plasma exosomes to identify the candidate biomarker of Imatinib Resistance in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia patients	chronic myeloid leukemia, exosomes, imatinib, ribosomal protein L13, ribosomal protein L14.	BACKGROUND: Imatinib (IM), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has markedly improved the survival and life quality of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. However, the lack of specific biomarkers for IM resistance remains a serious clinical challenge. Recently, growing evidence has suggested that exosome-harbored proteins were involved in tumor drug resistance and could be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and drug sensitivity prediction of cancer. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the proteomic profile of plasma exosomes derived from CML patients to identify ideal biomarkers for IM resistance. METHODS: We extracted exosomes from pooled plasma samples of 9 imatinib-resistant CML patients and 9 imatinib-sensitive CML patients by ultracentrifugation. Then, we identified the expression levels of exosomal proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based label free quantification. Bioinformatics analyses were used to analyze the proteomic data. Finally, the western blot (WB) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analyses were applied to validate the candidate proteins. RESULTS: A total of 2812 proteins were identified in plasma exosomes from imatinib-resistant and imatinib-sensitive CML patients, including 279 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) with restricted criteria (fold change>=1.5 or <=0.667, p<0.05). Compared with imatinib-sensitive CML patients, 151 proteins were up-regulated and 128 proteins were down-regulated. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the main function of the upregulated proteins was regulation of protein synthesis, while the downregulated proteins were mainly involved in lipid metabolism. The top 20 hub genes were obtained using STRING and Cytoscape, most of which were components of ribosomes. Moreover, we found that RPL13 and RPL14 exhibited exceptional upregulation in imatinib-resistant CML patients, which were further confirmed by PRM and WB. CONCLUSION: Proteomic analysis of plasma exosomes provides new ideas and important information for the study of IM resistance in CML. Especially the exosomal proteins (RPL13 and RPL14), which may have great potential as biomarkers of IM resistance.
PXD024636	34994563	Inhibition of Cathepsin B and SAPC Secreted by HIV-Infected Macrophages Reverses Common and Unique Apoptosis Pathways. 	Inhibition of cathepsin B and SAPC secreted by HIV-infected macrophages reverse common and unique apoptosis pathways	Apoptosis, Cathepsin B, HAND, HIV-1, SAPC, TMT	Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infects blood monocytes that cross the blood-brain barrier to the central nervous system, inducing neuronal damage. This is prompted by the secretion of viral and neurotoxic factors by HIV-infected macrophages, resulting in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. One of these neurotoxic factors is cathepsin B (CATB), a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays an important role in neurodegeneration. CATB interacts with the serum amyloid P component (SAPC), contributing to HIV-induced neurotoxicity. However, the neuronal apoptosis pathways triggered by CATB and the SAPC remain unknown. We aimed to elucidate these pathways in neurons exposed to HIV-infected macrophage-conditioned media before and after the inhibition of CATB or the SAPC with antibodies using tandem mass tag proteomics labeling. Based on the significant fold change (FC) >= |2| and p-value < 0.05 criteria, a total of 10, 48, and 13 proteins were deregulated after inhibiting CATB, SAPC antibodies, and the CATB inhibitor CA-074, respectively. We found that neurons exposed to the CATB antibody and SAPC antibody modulate similar proteins (TUBA1A and CYPA/PPIA) and unique proteins (LMNA and HSPH1 for the CATB antibody) or (CFL1 and PFN1 for the SAPC antibody). CATB, SAPC, or apoptosis-related proteins could become potential targets against HIV-induced neuronal degeneration.
PXD025965	34995961	Amaranthus hypochondriacus seeds as a rich source of cysteine rich bioactive peptides. 	Amaranthus hypochondriacus seeds as a rich source of cysteine rich bioactive peptides	Amaranthus hypochondriacus, alternative grain, cysteine rich peptides, peptidomics	Amaranthus hypochondriacus is a nutritious alternative grain native to Central and South America. Increased interest in the impact of A. hypochondriacus on the human body has driven characterization of bioactive secondary metabolites. The seeds are known to contain bioactive small molecules but little is known regarding endogenous peptides. Cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs) in foodstuffs are particularly relevant because they are stabilized by disulfide bonds enhancing resistance to digestion. Here, in silico predictions, proteomics, and simulated gastrointestinal digestions are leveraged to identify digestion resistant CRPs within A. hypochondriacus seeds. Thirteen in silico predicted CRPs were detected in a seed extract providing evidence for the translation of five CRP families. Mature forms of six CRPs were characterized via top-down proteomics revealing multiple post-translational modifications. All six peptides demonstrated resistance to simulated gastrointestinal digestion, suggesting that A. hypochondriacus CRPs may exhibit bioactivity after consumption and should be prioritized for further characterization.
PXD028944	34996345	Circulating microvesicles and exosomes in small cell lung cancer by quantitative proteomics. 	Circulating Microvesicles and Exosomes in Small Cell Lung Cancer by Quantitative Proteomics	Extracellular vesicles, Plasma	BACKGROUND: Early detection of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) crucially demands highly reliable markers. Growing evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles carry tumor cell-specific cargo suitable as protein markers in cancer. Quantitative proteomic profiling of circulating microvesicles and exosomes can be a high-throughput platform for discovery of novel molecular insights and putative markers. Hence, this study aimed to investigate proteome dynamics of plasma-derived microvesicles and exosomes in newly diagnosed SCLC patients to improve early detection. METHODS: Plasma-derived microvesicles and exosomes from 24 healthy controls and 24 SCLC patients were isolated from plasma by either high-speed- or ultracentrifugation. Proteins derived from these extracellular vesicles were quantified using label-free mass spectrometry and statistical analysis was carried out aiming at identifying significantly altered protein expressions between SCLC patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, significantly expressed proteins were subjected to functional enrichment analysis to identify biological pathways implicated in SCLC pathogenesis. RESULTS: Based on fold change (FC) >= 2 or <= 0.5 and AUC >= 0.70 (p < 0.05), we identified 10 common and 16 and 17 unique proteins for microvesicles and exosomes, respectively. Among these proteins, we found dysregulation of coagulation factor XIII A (Log2 FC =  - 1.1, p = 0.0003, AUC = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69-0.96) and complement factor H-related protein 4 (Log2 FC = 1.2, p = 0.0005, AUC = 0.82, 95% CI; 0.67-0.97) in SCLC patients compared to healthy individuals. Our data may indicate a novel tumor-suppressing role of blood coagulation and involvement of complement activation in SCLC pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: In comparing SCLC patients and healthy individuals, several differentially expressed proteins were identified. This is the first study showing that circulating extracellular vesicles may encompass specific proteins with potential diagnostic attributes for SCLC, thereby opening new opportunities as novel non-invasive markers.
PXD027527	34997000	Genomic studies controvert the existence of the CUX1 p75 isoform. 	Genomic studies controvert the existence of the CUX1 p75 isoform	Cux1, KG-1 cell line, Q-Exactive	CUX1, encoding a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, is recurrently deleted or mutated in multiple tumor types. In myeloid neoplasms, CUX1 deletion or mutation carries a poor prognosis. We have previously established that CUX1 functions as a tumor suppressor in hematopoietic cells across multiple organisms. Others, however, have described oncogenic functions of CUX1 in solid tumors, often attributed to truncated CUX1 isoforms, p75 and p110, generated by an alternative transcriptional start site or post-translational cleavage, respectively. Given the clinical relevance, it is imperative to clarify these discrepant activities. Herein, we sought to determine the CUX1 isoforms expressed in hematopoietic cells and find that they express the full-length p200 isoform. Through the course of this analysis, we found no evidence of the p75 alternative transcript in any cell type examined. Using an array of orthogonal approaches, including biochemistry, proteomics, CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing, and analysis of functional genomics datasets across a spectrum of normal and malignant tissue types, we found no data to support the existence of the CUX1 p75 isoform as previously described. Based on these results, prior studies of p75 require reevaluation, including the interpretation of oncogenic roles attributed to CUX1.
PXD030006	34999732	Regulation of Src tumor activity by its N-terminal intrinsically disordered region. 	Regulation of Src tumor activity by its N-terminal intrinsically disordered region	cell signaling, cell transformation, intrinsically disordered region, protein kinase	The membrane-anchored Src tyrosine kinase is involved in numerous pathways and its deregulation is involved in human cancer. Our knowledge on Src regulation relies on crystallography, which revealed intramolecular interactions to control active Src conformations. However, Src contains a N-terminal intrinsically disordered unique domain (UD) whose function remains unclear. Using NMR, we reported that UD forms an intramolecular fuzzy complex involving a conserved region with lipid-binding capacity named Unique Lipid-Binding Region (ULBR), which could modulate Src membrane anchoring. Here we show that the ULBR is essential for Src's oncogenic capacity. ULBR inactive mutations inhibited Src transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells and in human colon cancer cells. It also reduced Src-induced tumor development in nude mice. An intact ULBR was required for MAPK signaling without affecting Src kinase activity nor sub-cellular localization. Phospho-proteomic analyses revealed that, while not impacting on the global tyrosine phospho-proteome in colon cancer cells, this region modulates phosphorylation of specific membrane-localized tyrosine kinases needed for Src oncogenic signaling, including EPHA2 and Fyn. Collectively, this study reveals an important role of this intrinsically disordered region in malignant cell transformation and suggests a novel layer of Src regulation by this unique region via membrane substrate phosphorylation.
PXD032189	35002223	Identification of Active Ingredients of Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction for Promoting Nerve Function Recovery After Ischemic Stroke Using HT22 Live-Cell-Based Affinity Chromatography Combined with HPLC-MS/MS. 	Integrated Network Pharmacology and Proteomics to Reveal the Molecular Therapeutic Effects of Buyang Huanwu Decoction on Ischemic Stroke	Buyang Huanwu Decoction, Ischemic Stroke	OBJECTIVE: The Chinese medicine Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Decoction (HGWD) has been reported to improve the clinical symptoms and restore nerve function after ischemic stroke; however, its active ingredients are not well-determined. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the bioactive compounds of HGWD and explore the possible mechanism of action. METHODS: The methods, including live HT22 cells, solid-phase extraction, and HPLC-MS/MS were utilized. The potential ingredients were identified through comparisons with literature and monomer compounds. Then, oxygen-glucose deprivation reperfusion (OGD/R)-treated HT22 cells were utilized to investigate the effect of HGWD components with specific binding affinities. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and Tunel staining were used as testing indexes to analyze the protective effects of potential active ingredients on OGD/R-induced damage. RESULTS: Eleven compounds with specific binding affinities were identified as calycosin-7-O-glucoside, calycosin, formononetin, cinnamic alcohol, cinnamic acid, betaine, dl-2-phenylpropionic acid, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 6-methylcoumarin, wogonin, and paeoniflorin. Among them, six compounds had a protective effect on OGD/R-treated HT22 cells. Furthermore, calycosin-7-O-glucoside, calycosin, paeoniflorin, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, wogonin, and formononetin could regulate oxidative stress and apoptosis to attenuate the cell damage caused by OGD/R. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of action of HGWD to promote neurological recovery after ischemic stroke was related to the regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis. This study suggested that cell membrane affinity chromatography combined with HPLC-MS/MS could be applied to screen potential active components in traditional Chinese medicines (TCM).
PXD026270	35002690	Snake Venom Proteomics of Samar Cobra (Naja samarensis) from the Southern Philippines: Short Alpha-Neurotoxins as the Dominant Lethal Component Weakly Cross-Neutralized by the Philippine Cobra Antivenom. 	Proteome data of snake venoms_file 8	LCMS/MS, Snake venom, Venom proteome	The Samar Cobra, Naja samarensis, is endemic to the southern Philippines and is a WHO-listed Category 1 venomous snake species of medical importance. Envenomation caused by N. samarensis results in neurotoxicity, while there is no species-specific antivenom available for its treatment. The composition and neutralization of N. samarensis venom remain largely unknown to date. This study thus aimed to investigate the venom proteome of N. samarensis for a comprehensive profiling of the venom composition, and to examine the immunorecognition as well as neutralization of its toxins by a hetero-specific antivenom. Applying C18 reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), three-finger toxins (3FTx) were shown to dominate the venom proteome by 90.48% of total venom proteins. Other proteins in the venom comprised snake venom metalloproteinases, phospholipases A2, cysteine-rich secretory proteins, venom nerve growth factors, L-amino acid oxidases and vespryn, which were present at much lower abundances. Among all, short-chain alpha-neurotoxins (SalphaNTX) were the most highly expressed toxin within 3FTx family, constituting 65.87% of the total venom proteins. The SalphaNTX is the sole neurotoxic component of the venom and has an intravenous median lethal dose (LD50) of 0.18 mug/g in mice. The high abundance and low LD50 support the potent lethal activity of N. samarensis venom. The hetero-specific antivenom, Philippine Cobra Antivenom (PCAV, raised against Naja philippinensis) were immunoreactive toward the venom and its protein fractions, including the principal SalphaNTX. In efficacy study, PCAV was able to cross-neutralize the lethality of SalphaNTX albeit the effect was weak with a low potency of 0.20 mg/ml (defined as the amount of toxin completely neutralized per milliliter of the antivenom). With a volume of 5 ml, each vial of PCAV may cross-neutralize approximately 1 mg of the toxin in vivo. The findings support the potential para-specific use of PCAV in treating envenomation caused by N. samarensis while underscoring the need to improve the potency of its neutralization activity, especially against the highly lethal alpha-neurotoxins.
PXD028622	35002716	Toxicokinetics of Arenobufagin and its Cardiotoxicity Mechanism Exploration Based on Lipidomics and Proteomics Approaches in Rats. 	Toxicokinetics of arenobufagin and its cardiotoxicity mechanism exploration based on lipidomics and proteomics approaches in rats	arenobufagin, cardiotoxicity, lipidomics, toxicokinetic	Arenobufagin (ArBu), one of the main active bufadienolides of toad venom with cardiotonic effect, analgesic effect, and outstanding anti-tumor potentiality, is also a potential cardiotoxic component. In the present study, the cardiac effect of ArBu and its underlying mechanism were explored by integrating data such as heart rates, toxicokinetics, myocardial enzyme and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) activity, pathological sections, lipidomics and proteomics. Under different doses, the cardiac effects turned out to be different. The oral dose of 60 mg/kg of ArBu sped up the heart rate. However, 120 mg/kg ArBu mainly reduced the heart rate. Over time, they all returned to normal, consisting of the trend of ArBu concentration-time curve. High concentrations of myocardial enzymes and BNP indicated that ArBu inhibited or impaired the cardiac function of rats. Pathological sections of hearts also showed that ArBu caused myocardial fiber disorder and rupture, in which the high-dose group was more serious. At the same time, serum and heart tissue lipidomics were used to explore the changes in body lipid metabolism under different doses. The data indicated a larger difference in the high-dose ArBu group. There were likewise many significant differences in the proteomics of the heart. Furthermore, a multi-layered network was used to integrate the above information to explore the potential mechanism. Finally, 4 proteins that were shown to be significantly and differentially expressed were validated by targeted proteomics using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis. Our findings indicated that ArBu behaved as a bidirectional regulation of the heart. The potential mechanism of cardiac action was revealed with the increased dose, which provided a useful reference for the safety of clinical application of ArBu.
PXD028691	35002739	Elevated N-Glycosylation Contributes to the Cisplatin Resistance of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells Revealed by Membrane Proteomic and Glycoproteomic Analysis. 	Elevated N-glycosylation of Membrane Proteins Contributes to the Cisplatin Resistance of Non-small-cell Lung Cancer Cells	Cisplatin resistance, N-glycoproteomics, N-glycosylation	Chemoresistance is the major restriction on the clinical use of cisplatin. Aberrant changes in protein glycosylation are closely associated with drug resistance. Comprehensive study on the role of protein glycosylation in the development of cisplatin resistance would contribute to precise elucidation of the complicated mechanism of resistance. However, comprehensive characterization of glycosylated proteins remains a big challenge. In this work, we integrated proteomic and N-glycoproteomic workflow to comprehensively characterize the cisplatin resistance-related membrane proteins. Using this method, we found that proteins implicated in cell adhesion, migration, response to drug, and signal transduction were significantly altered in both protein abundance and glycosylation level during the development of cisplatin resistance in the non-small cell lung cancer cell line. Accordingly, the ability of cell migration and invasion was markedly increased in cisplatin-resistant cells, hence intensifying their malignancy. In contrast, the intracellular cisplatin accumulation was significantly reduced in the resistant cells concomitant with the down-regulation of drug uptake channel protein, LRRC8A, and over-expression of drug efflux pump proteins, MRP1 and MRP4. Moreover, the global glycosylation was elevated in the cisplatin-resistant cells. Consequently, inhibition of N-glycosylation reduced cell resistance to cisplatin, whereas promoting the high-mannose or sialylated type of glycosylation enhanced the resistance, suggesting that critical glycosylation type contributes to cisplatin resistance. These results demonstrate the high efficiency of the integrated proteomic and N-glycoproteomic workflow in discovering drug resistance-related targets, and provide new insights into the mechanism of cisplatin resistance.
PXD028795	35003059	Palladium-Induced Temporal Internalization of MHC Class I Contributes to T Cell-Mediated Antigenicity. 	MHC class I ligandome of cells treated with palladium	mhc, palladium	Palladium (Pd) is a widely used metal and extremely important biomaterial for the reconstruction of occlusions during dental restorations. However, metallic biomaterials can cause serious allergic reactions, such as Pd-related oral mucositis seen in dentistry. Metal allergy is categorized as a type IV allergy and we demonstrated that CD8 T cells play an important role in Pd allergy previously. As TCR of CD8 T cells recognizes MHC class I/peptide complex, the antigen specificity to this complex seems to be generated during Pd allergy. However, it remains unknown if Pd affects the MHC class I/peptide complex. In this study, we investigated the behavior of the MHC class I/peptide complex in response to Pd treatment. We found that PdCl2 treatment altered peptide presentation on MHC class I and that co-culture with Pd-treated DC2.4 cells induced activation of Pd-responsive TCR-expressing T cell line. Furthermore, PdCl2 treatment induced temporal MHC class I internalization and inhibition of membrane movement suppressed Pd-induced T cell-mediated antigenicity. These data suggest that Pd-induced MHC class I internalization is critical for generation of antigenicity through a mechanism including differential peptide loading on MHC class I, which results in Pd allergy.
PXD015199	35004641	Gold Nanoparticles Augment N-Terminal Cleavage and Splicing Reactions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis SufB. 	Identification of full length, splicing and cleavage products of SufB protein of SUF-complex of Mycobacterium tuberculosis	Mycobacterium tuberculosis, SufB, cleavage products, splicing	Protein splicing is a self-catalyzed event where the intervening sequence intein cleaves off, joining the flanking exteins together to generate a functional protein. Attempts have been made to regulate the splicing rate through variations in temperature, pH, and metals. Although metal-regulated protein splicing has been more captivating to researchers, metals were shown to only inhibit splicing reactions that confine their application. This is the first study to show the effect of nanoparticles (NPs) on protein splicing. We found that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of various sizes can increase the splicing efficiency by more than 50% and the N-terminal cleavage efficiency by more than 45% in Mycobacterium tuberculosis SufB precursor protein. This study provides an effective strategy for engineering splicing-enhanced intein platforms. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed AuNP interaction with the native protein. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) analysis suggested a significant reduction in the energy barrier at the N-terminal cleavage site in the presence of gold atom, strengthening our experimental evidence on heightened the N-terminal cleavage reaction. The encouraging observation of enhanced N-terminal cleavage and splicing reaction can have potential implementations from developing a rapid drug delivery system to designing a contemporary protein purification system.
PXD029547	35007290	Hyperinflammatory environment drives dysfunctional myeloid cell effector response to bacterial challenge in COVID-19. 	Neutrophil and monocyte dysfunctional effector response towards bacterial challenge in critically ill COVID-19 patients	COVID-19, ProteomeXchange project tag: Covid-19, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial superinfections, effector response, hypercytokinemia, monocytes, neutrophils, reactive oxygen species	COVID-19 displays diverse disease severities and symptoms including acute systemic inflammation and hypercytokinemia, with subsequent dysregulation of immune cells. Bacterial superinfections in COVID-19 can further complicate the disease course and are associated with increased mortality. However, there is limited understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and hypercytokinemia impede the innate immune function against bacterial superinfections. We assessed the influence of COVID-19 plasma hypercytokinemia on the functional responses of myeloid immune cells upon bacterial challenges from acute-phase COVID-19 patients and their corresponding recovery-phase. We show that a severe hypercytokinemia status in COVID-19 patients correlates with the development of bacterial superinfections. Neutrophils and monocytes derived from COVID-19 patients in their acute-phase showed an impaired intracellular microbicidal capacity upon bacterial challenges. The impaired microbicidal capacity was reflected by abrogated MPO and reduced NETs production in neutrophils along with reduced ROS production in both neutrophils and monocytes. Moreover, we observed a distinct pattern of cell surface receptor expression on both neutrophils and monocytes, in line with suppressed autocrine and paracrine cytokine signaling. This phenotype was characterized by a high expression of CD66b, CXCR4 and low expression of CXCR1, CXCR2 and CD15 in neutrophils and low expression of HLA-DR, CD86 and high expression of CD163 and CD11b in monocytes. Furthermore, the impaired antibacterial effector function was mediated by synergistic effect of the cytokines TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-4. COVID-19 patients receiving dexamethasone showed a significant reduction of overall inflammatory markers in the plasma as well as exhibited an enhanced immune response towards bacterial challenge ex vivo. Finally, broad anti-inflammatory treatment was associated with a reduction in CRP, IL-6 levels as well as length of ICU stay and ventilation-days in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Our data provides insights into the transient functional dysregulation of myeloid immune cells against subsequent bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients and describe a beneficial role for the use of dexamethasone in these patients.
PXD029183	35007762	Interactome Analysis of Human Phospholipase D and Phosphatidic Acid-Associated Protein Network. 	Interactome analysis of human phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid-associated protein network	PJA2, Phosphatidic Acid, Phospholipase D, S1P, SPHK1, mTOR	Mammalian phospholipase D (PLD) enzyme family consists of six members. Among them, PLD1/2/6 catalyzes phosphatidic acid (PA) production, while PLD3/4/5 has no catalytic activities. Deregulation of the PLD-PA lipid signaling has been associated with various human diseases including cancer. However, a comprehensive analysis of the regulators and effectors for this crucial lipid metabolic pathway has not been fully achieved. Using a proteomic approach, we defined the protein interaction network for the human PLD family of enzymes and PA and revealed diverse cellular signaling events involving them. Through it, we identified PJA2 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for PLD1 involved in control of the PLD1-mediated mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Additionally, we showed that PA interacted with and positively regulated sphingosine kinase 1. Taken together, our study not only generates a rich interactome resource for further characterizing the human PLD-PA lipid signaling but also connects this important metabolic pathway with numerous biological processes.
PXD029627	35008409	Comparative O-GlcNAc Proteomic Analysis Reveals a Role of O-GlcNAcylated SAM68 in Lung Cancer Aggressiveness. 	Comparative O-GlcNAc Proteomic Analysis Reveals a Role of O-GlcNAcylated SAM68 in Lung Cancer Aggressiveness	Lung adenocarcinoma, O-GlcNAc transferase, O-GlcNAcylation, SAM68	O-GlcNAcylation is a reversible and dynamic post-translational protein modification catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Despite the reported association of O-GlcNAcylation with cancer metastasis, the O-GlcNAc proteome profile for cancer aggressiveness remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we report our comparative O-GlcNAc proteome profiling of two differentially invasive lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, which identified 158 down-regulated and 106 up-regulated candidates in highly invasive cells. Among these differential proteins, a nuclear RNA-binding protein, SAM68 (SRC associated in mitosis of 68 kDa), was further investigated. Results showed that SAM68 is O-GlcNAcylated and may interact with OGT in the nucleus. Eleven O-GlcNAcylation sites were identified, and data from mutant analysis suggested that multiple serine residues in the N-terminal region are important for O-GlcNAcylation and the function of SAM68 in modulating cancer cell migration and invasion. Analysis of clinical specimens found that high SAM68 expression was associated with late cancer stages, and patients with high-OGT/high-SAM68 expression in their tumors had poorer overall survival compared to those with low-OGT/low-SAM68 expression. Our study revealed an invasiveness-associated O-GlcNAc proteome profile and connected O-GlcNAcylated SAM68 to lung cancer aggressiveness.
PXD029965	35011611	Altered Ca(2+) Homeostasis in Red Blood Cells of Polycythemia Vera Patients Following Disturbed Organelle Sorting during Terminal Erythropoiesis. 	Investigating the proteome of red blood cells and reticulocytes in Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia	Essential Thrombocythemia, Human red blood cells, JAK2V617F, Orbitrap Fusion, Polycythemia Vera, erythrocytes, nLC-MS/MS, reticulocytes	Over 95% of Polycythemia Vera (PV) patients carry the V617F mutation in the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), resulting in uncontrolled erythroid proliferation and a high risk of thrombosis. Using mass spectrometry, we analyzed the RBC membrane proteome and showed elevated levels of multiple Ca(2+) binding proteins as well as endoplasmic-reticulum-residing proteins in PV RBC membranes compared with RBC membranes from healthy individuals. In this study, we investigated the impact of JAK2(V617F) on (1) calcium homeostasis and RBC ion channel activity and (2) protein expression and sorting during terminal erythroid differentiation. Our data from automated patch-clamp show modified calcium homeostasis in PV RBCs and cell lines expressing JAK2(V617F), with a functional impact on the activity of the Gardos channel that could contribute to cellular dehydration. We show that JAK2(V617F) could play a role in organelle retention during the enucleation step of erythroid differentiation, resulting in modified whole cell proteome in reticulocytes and RBCs in PV patients. Given the central role that calcium plays in the regulation of signaling pathways, our study opens new perspectives to exploring the relationship between JAK2(V617F), calcium homeostasis, and cellular abnormalities in myeloproliferative neoplasms, including cellular interactions in the bloodstream in relation to thrombotic events.
PXD028673	35011700	Temporal Quantitative Phosphoproteomics Profiling of Interleukin-33 Signaling Network Reveals Unique Modulators of Monocyte Activation. 	A proteomic landscape of the spatiotemporal influence of Interleukin-33 (IL-33) in monocytes	cytokines, inflammation, innate immunity, monocytes, signaling	Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a member of the IL-1 superfamily cytokines, is an endogenous danger signal and a nuclear-associated cytokine. It is one of the essential mediators of both innate and adaptive immune responses. Aberrant IL-33 signaling has been demonstrated to play a defensive role against various infectious and inflammatory diseases. Although the signaling responses mediated by IL-33 have been previously reported, the temporal signaling dynamics are yet to be explored. To this end, we applied quantitative temporal phosphoproteomics analysis to elucidate pathways and proteins induced by IL-33 in THP-1 monocytes. Employing a TMT labeling-based quantitation and titanium dioxide (TiO2)-based phosphopeptide enrichment strategy followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we identified and quantified 9448 unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 3392 proteins that showed differential regulation. Of these, 171 protein kinases, 60 phosphatases and 178 transcription factors were regulated at different phases of IL-33 signaling. In addition to the confirmed activation of canonical signaling modules including MAPK, NFkappaB, PI3K/AKT modules, pathway analysis of the time-dependent phosphorylation dynamics revealed enrichment of several cellular processes, including leukocyte adhesion, response to reactive oxygen species, cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage and repair pathways. The detailed quantitative phosphoproteomic map of IL-33 signaling will serve as a potentially useful resource to study its function in the context of inflammatory and pathological conditions.
PXD022238	35013064	Time series proteome profile analysis reveals a protective role of citrate synthase in angiotensin II-induced atrial fibrillation. 	Time-series proteome profiling analysis of the atria in a murine model of angiotensin II-induced atrial fibrillation	Angiotensin II, Atrial fibrillation, Time series protein expression profiling	BACKGROUND: Angiotensin (Ang) II and elevated blood pressure are considered to be the main risk factors for atrial fibrillation. However, the proteome profiles and key mediators/signaling pathways involved in the development of Ang II-induced atrial fibrillation remain unclear. METHODS: Male wild-type C57BL/6 mice (10-week old) were infused with Ang II (2000 ng/kg per min) for 1, 2, or 3 weeks, respectively. Time series proteome profiling of atrial tissues was performed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1566 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the atrial tissues at weeks 1, 2, and 3 after Ang II infusion. These DEPs were predominantly involved in mitochondrial oxidation-reduction and tricarboxylic acid cycle in Ang II-infused atria. Moreover, coexpression network analysis revealed that citrate synthase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, was localized at the center of the mitochondrial oxidation-reduction process, and its expression was significantly downreguated in Ang II-infused atria at different time points. Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpresion of citrate synthase markedly reduced atrial fibrillation susceptibility and atrial remodeling in mice. These beneficial effects were associated with increased ATP production and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system complexes I-V expression and inhibition of oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: The current study defines the dynamic changes of the DEPs involved in Ang II-induced atrial fibrillation, and identifies that citrate synthase plays a protective role in regulating atrial fibrillation development, and increased citrate synthase expression may represent a potential therapeutic option for atrial fibrillation treatment.
PXD029256	35013194	The catalytic activity of TCPTP is auto-regulated by its intrinsically disordered tail and activated by Integrin alpha-1. 	The catalytic activity of TCPTP is auto-regulated by its intrinsically disordered tail and activated by Integrin alpha-1	Intermolecular CX-MS, Intramolecular CX-MS, PTPN2, TCPTP	T-Cell Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (TCPTP, PTPN2) is a non-receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase that is ubiquitously expressed in human cells. TCPTP is a critical component of a variety of key signaling pathways that are directly associated with the formation of cancer and inflammation. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism of TCPTP activation and regulation is essential for the development of TCPTP therapeutics. Under basal conditions, TCPTP is largely inactive, although how this is achieved is poorly understood. By combining biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, and chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry, we show that the C-terminal intrinsically disordered tail of TCPTP functions as an intramolecular autoinhibitory element that controls the TCPTP catalytic activity. Activation of TCPTP is achieved by cellular competition, i.e., the intrinsically disordered cytosolic tail of Integrin-alpha1 displaces the TCPTP autoinhibitory tail, allowing for the full activation of TCPTP. This work not only defines the mechanism by which TCPTP is regulated but also reveals that the intrinsically disordered tails of two of the most closely related PTPs (PTP1B and TCPTP) autoregulate the activity of their cognate PTPs via completely different mechanisms.
PXD023234	35013197	Linking post-translational modifications and protein turnover by site-resolved protein turnover profiling. 	Linking post-translational modifications and protein turnover by site-resolved protein turnover (SPOT) profiling	FBXW7, PTMs, Phospho, TKT, Ubiquitin, proteasome	Proteome-wide measurements of protein turnover have largely ignored the impact of post-translational modifications (PTMs). To address this gap, we employ stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to measure the turnover of >120,000 peptidoforms including >33,000 phosphorylated, acetylated, and ubiquitinated peptides for >9,000 native proteins. This site-resolved protein turnover (SPOT) profiling discloses global and site-specific differences in turnover associated with the presence or absence of PTMs. While causal relationships may not always be immediately apparent, we speculate that PTMs with diverging turnover may distinguish states of differential protein stability, structure, localization, enzymatic activity, or protein-protein interactions. We show examples of how the turnover data may give insights into unknown functions of PTMs and provide a freely accessible online tool that allows interrogation and visualisation of all turnover data. The SPOT methodology is applicable to many cell types and modifications, offering the potential to prioritize PTMs for future functional investigations.
PXD029652	35013218	EZH2 depletion potentiates MYC degradation inhibiting neuroblastoma and small cell carcinoma tumor formation. 	EZH2 depletion potentiates MYC degradation inhibiting neuroblastoma and small cell carcinoma tumor formation	AP-MS, EZH2, MYC, MYCN	Efforts to therapeutically target EZH2 have generally focused on inhibition of its methyltransferase activity, although it remains less clear whether this is the central mechanism whereby EZH2 promotes cancer. In the current study, we show that EZH2 directly interacts with both MYC family oncoproteins, MYC and MYCN, and promotes their stabilization in a methyltransferase-independent manner. By competing against the SCF(FBW7) ubiquitin ligase to bind MYC and MYCN, EZH2 counteracts FBW7-mediated MYC(N) polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Depletion, but not enzymatic inhibition, of EZH2 induces robust MYC(N) degradation and inhibits tumor cell growth in MYC(N) driven neuroblastoma and small cell lung carcinoma. Here, we demonstrate the MYC family proteins as global EZH2 oncogenic effectors and EZH2 pharmacologic degraders as potential MYC(N) targeted cancer therapeutics, pointing out that MYC(N) driven cancers may develop inherent resistance to the canonical EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors currently in clinical development.
PXD029290	35013227	Topographic mapping of the glioblastoma proteome reveals a triple-axis model of intra-tumoral heterogeneity. 	Topographic mapping of the glioblastoma proteome reveals a triple axis model of intra-tumoral heterogeneity	GBM	Glioblastoma is an aggressive form of brain cancer with well-established patterns of intra-tumoral heterogeneity implicated in treatment resistance and progression. While regional and single cell transcriptomic variations of glioblastoma have been recently resolved, downstream phenotype-level proteomic programs have yet to be assigned across glioblastoma's hallmark histomorphologic niches. Here, we leverage mass spectrometry to spatially align abundance levels of 4,794 proteins to distinct histologic patterns across 20 patients and propose diverse molecular programs operational within these regional tumor compartments. Using machine learning, we overlay concordant transcriptional information, and define two distinct proteogenomic programs, MYC- and KRAS-axis hereon, that cooperate with hypoxia to produce a tri-dimensional model of intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Moreover, we highlight differential drug sensitivities and relative chemoresistance in glioblastoma cell lines with enhanced KRAS programs. Importantly, these pharmacological differences are less pronounced in transcriptional glioblastoma subgroups suggesting that this model may provide insights for targeting heterogeneity and overcoming therapy resistance.
PXD021768	35013237	Grainyhead 1 acts as a drug-inducible conserved transcriptional regulator linked to insulin signaling and lifespan. 	Identification of human GRHL1 interactors and post-translational modifications by LC-MS/MS	GRHL1, Interactors, Post-translational modification, Transcription Factor	Aging is impacted by interventions across species, often converging on metabolic pathways. Transcription factors regulate longevity yet approaches for their pharmacological modulation to exert geroprotection remain sparse. We show that increased expression of the transcription factor Grainyhead 1 (GRH-1) promotes lifespan and pathogen resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans. A compound screen identifies FDA-approved drugs able to activate human GRHL1 and promote nematodal GRH-1-dependent longevity. GRHL1 activity is regulated by post-translational lysine methylation and the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase C2A. Consistently, nematodal longevity following impairment of the PI 3-kinase or insulin/IGF-1 receptor requires grh-1. In BXD mice, Grhl1 expression is positively correlated with lifespan and insulin sensitivity. In humans, GRHL1 expression positively correlates with insulin receptor signaling and also with lifespan. Fasting blood glucose levels, including in individuals with type 2 diabetes, are negatively correlated with GRHL1 expression. Thereby, GRH-1/GRHL1 is identified as a pharmacologically malleable transcription factor impacting insulin signaling and lifespan.
PXD029013	35013249	Cryo-EM structure of native human thyroglobulin. 	Cryo-EM structure of native human thyroglobulin	LC-MS, thyroglobulin	The thyroglobulin (TG) protein is essential to thyroid hormone synthesis, plays a vital role in the regulation of metabolism, development and growth and serves as intraglandular iodine storage. Its architecture is conserved among vertebrates. Synthesis of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones depends on the conformation, iodination and post-translational modification of TG. Although structural information is available on recombinant and deglycosylated endogenous human thyroglobulin (hTG) from patients with goiters, the structure of native, fully glycosylated hTG remained unknown. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of native and fully glycosylated hTG from healthy thyroid glands to 3.2 Aa resolution. The structure provides detailed information on hormonogenic and glycosylation sites. We employ liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to validate these findings as well as other post-translational modifications and proteolytic cleavage sites. Our results offer insights into thyroid hormonogenesis of native hTG and provide a fundamental understanding of clinically relevant mutations.
PXD025887	35013263	Microbial enzymes induce colitis by reactivating triclosan in the mouse gastrointestinal tract. 	Specific Gut Microbial Enzymes Drive Colitis Promotion by Triclosan	Gut Microbiome, Triclosan	Emerging research supports that triclosan (TCS), an antimicrobial agent found in thousands of consumer products, exacerbates colitis and colitis-associated colorectal tumorigenesis in animal models. While the intestinal toxicities of TCS require the presence of gut microbiota, the molecular mechanisms involved have not been defined. Here we show that intestinal commensal microbes mediate metabolic activation of TCS in the colon and drive its gut toxicology. Using a range of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches, we identify specific microbial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes involved and pinpoint molecular motifs required to metabolically activate TCS in the gut. Finally, we show that targeted inhibition of bacterial GUS enzymes abolishes the colitis-promoting effects of TCS, supporting an essential role of specific microbial proteins in TCS toxicity. Together, our results define a mechanism by which intestinal microbes contribute to the metabolic activation and gut toxicity of TCS, and highlight the importance of considering the contributions of the gut microbiota in evaluating the toxic potential of environmental chemicals.
PXD029624	35013284	Hypocrates is a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor for (pseudo)hypohalous acids and their derivatives. 	Hypocrates, a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor for (pseudo)hypohalous acids and their derivatives	biosensor, fluorescence, hypohalous acids, ratiometric, visualization	The lack of tools to monitor the dynamics of (pseudo)hypohalous acids in live cells and tissues hinders a better understanding of inflammatory processes. Here we present a fluorescent genetically encoded biosensor, Hypocrates, for the visualization of (pseudo)hypohalous acids and their derivatives. Hypocrates consists of a circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein integrated into the structure of the transcription repressor NemR from Escherichia coli. We show that Hypocrates is ratiometric, reversible, and responds to its analytes in the 10(6) M(-1)s(-1) range. Solving the Hypocrates X-ray structure provided insights into its sensing mechanism, allowing determination of the spatial organization in this circularly permuted fluorescent protein-based redox probe. We exemplify its applicability by imaging hypohalous stress in bacteria phagocytosed by primary neutrophils. Finally, we demonstrate that Hypocrates can be utilized in combination with HyPerRed for the simultaneous visualization of (pseudo)hypohalous acids and hydrogen peroxide dynamics in a zebrafish tail fin injury model.
PXD028564	35014747	Elucidation of the protein composition of mouse seminal vesicle fluid. 	Elucidation of the protein composition of mouse seminal vesicle fluid	bioinformatics, seminal vesicle fluid	The seminal vesicles are male accessory sex glands that contribute the major portion of the seminal plasma in which mammalian spermatozoa are bathed during ejaculation. In addition to conveying sperm through the ejaculatory duct, seminal vesicle secretions support sperm survival after ejaculation, and influence the female reproductive tract to promote receptivity to pregnancy. Analysis of seminal vesicle fluid (SVF) composition by proteomics has proven challenging, due to its highly biased protein signature with a small subset of dominant proteins and the difficulty of solubilizing this viscous fluid. As such, publicly available proteomic datasets identify only 85 SVF proteins in total. To address this limitation, we report a new preparative methodology involving sequential solubilization of mouse SVF in guanidine hydrochloride, acetone precipitation, and analysis by label-free mass spectrometry. Using this strategy, we identified 126 SVF proteins, including 83 previously undetected in SVF. Members of the seminal vesicle secretory protein family were the most abundant, accounting for 79% of all peptide spectrum matches. Functional analysis identified inflammation and formation of the vaginal plug as the two most prominent biological processes. Other notable processes included modulation of sperm function and regulation of the female reproductive tract immune environment. Together, these findings provide a robust methodological framework for future SVF studies and identify novel proteins with potential to influence both male and female reproductive physiology.
PXD028109	35014847	SILAC Phosphoproteomics Reveals Unique Signaling Circuits in CAR-T Cells and the Inhibition of B Cell-Activating Phosphorylation in Target Cells. 	CAR T cells inhibit B cell activating phosphorylation in their targets	CarT signaling, phosphoproteomics, phosphotyrosine	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a single-pass transmembrane receptor designed to specifically target and eliminate cancers. While CARs prove highly efficacious against B cell malignancies, the intracellular signaling events which promote CAR T cell activity remain elusive. To gain further insight into both CAR T cell signaling and the potential signaling response of cells targeted by CAR, we analyzed phosphopeptides captured by two separate phosphoenrichment strategies from third generation CD19-CAR T cells cocultured with SILAC labeled Raji B cells by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Here, we report that CD19-CAR T cells upregulated several key phosphorylation events also observed in canonical T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, while Raji B cells exhibited a significant decrease in B cell receptor-signaling related phosphorylation events in response to coculture. Our data suggest that CD19-CAR stimulation activates a mixture of unique CD19-CAR-specific signaling pathways and canonical TCR signaling, while global phosphorylation in Raji B cells is reduced after association with the CD19-CAR T cells.
PXD030065	35016969	Potential protein markers in children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) revealed by salivary proteomics. 	Proteomics Analysis of Saliva from Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder	Austism Spectrum Disorder, Biomarker, Saliva	The lack of specific pharmacological therapy for Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and its clinical heterogeneity demand efforts directed toward the identification of biomarkers to aid in diagnosis. Proteomics offers a new perspective for studying the altered proteins associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and we have saliva as an easy-to-collect biological fluid with important biomolecules for investigating biomarkers in various diseases. In this sense, saliva could be used to identify potential biomarkers of ASD. In the current work, saliva samples were collected from children with different degrees of ASD and healthy children and proteomics approaches were applied to generate data on differentially expressed proteins between groups which will serve as a basis for future validation studies as protein markers. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD030065. As results, 132 proteins were present in 80% of the saliva pools of all analyzed groups. Twenty-five proteins were identified as overexpressed in the group of severe and mild/moderate ASD carriers, among which, eight were identified as potential biomarkers for ASD.
PXD029956	35017099	Comparative Analysis of T-Cell Spatial Proteomics and the Influence of HIV Expression. 	Comparative Analysis of T Cell Spatial Proteomics and the Influence of HIV Expression	HIV-1, Spatial proteomics	As systems biology approaches to virology have become more tractable, highly studied viruses such as HIV can now be analyzed in new unbiased ways, including spatial proteomics. We employed here a differential centrifugation protocol to fractionate Jurkat T cells for proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry; these cells contain inducible HIV-1 genomes, enabling us to look for changes in the spatial proteome induced by viral gene expression. Using these proteomics data, we evaluated the merits of several reported machine learning pipelines for classification of the spatial proteome and identification of protein translocations. From these analyses, we found that classifier performance in this system was organelle dependent, with Bayesian t-augmented Gaussian mixture modeling outperforming support vector machine learning for mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum proteins but underperforming on cytosolic, nuclear, and plasma membrane proteins by QSep analysis. We also observed a generally higher performance for protein translocation identification using a Bayesian model, Bayesian analysis of differential localization experiments, on row-normalized data. Comparative Bayesian analysis of differential localization experiment analysis of cells induced to express the WT viral genome versus cells induced to express a genome unable to express the accessory protein Nef identified known Nef-dependent interactors such as T-cell receptor signaling components and coatomer complex. Finally, we found that support vector machine classification showed higher consistency and was less sensitive to HIV-dependent noise. These findings illustrate important considerations for studies of the spatial proteome following viral infection or viral gene expression and provide a reference for future studies of HIV-gene-dropout viruses.
PXD022909	35017148	B cells imprint adoptively transferred CD8(+) T cells with enhanced tumor immunity. 	TLR9-activated B cells imprint adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells with potent tumor immunity and persistence	T cells Adoptive cell transfer therapy Toll-like receptors melanoma B cells	BACKGROUND: Adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) therapy improves outcomes in patients with advanced malignancies, yet many individuals relapse due to the infusion of T cells with poor function or persistence. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can invigorate antitumor T cell responses when administered directly to patients, but these responses often coincide with toxicities. We posited that TLR agonists could be repurposed ex vivo to condition T cells with remarkable potency in vivo, circumventing TLR-related toxicity. METHODS: In this study we investigated how tumor-specific murine CD8(+) T cells and human tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are impacted when expanded ex vivo with the TLR9 agonist CpG. RESULTS: Herein we reveal a new way to reverse the tolerant state of adoptively transferred CD8(+) T cells against tumors using TLR-activated B cells. We repurposed the TLR9 agonist, CpG, commonly used in the clinic, to bolster T cell-B cell interactions during expansion for ACT. T cells expanded ex vivo from a CpG-treated culture demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy and prolonged persistence in vivo. This antitumor efficacy was accomplished without in vivo administration of TLR agonists or other adjuvants of high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 or vaccination, which are classically required for effective ACT therapy. CpG-conditioned CD8(+) T cells acquired a unique proteomic signature hallmarked by an IL-2Ralpha(high)ICOS(high)CD39(low) phenotype and an altered metabolic profile, all reliant on B cells transiently present in the culture. Likewise, human TILs benefitted from expansion with CpG ex vivo, as they also possessed the IL-2Ralpha(high)ICOS(high)CD39(low) phenotype. CpG fostered the expansion of potent CD8(+) T cells with the signature phenotype and antitumor ability via empowering a direct B-T cell interaction. Isolated B cells also imparted T cells with the CpG-associated phenotype and improved tumor immunity without the aid of additional antigen-presenting cells or other immune cells in the culture. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a novel way to use TLR agonists to improve immunotherapy and reveal a vital role for B cells in the generation of potent CD8(+) T cell-based therapies. Our findings have immediate implications in the clinical treatment of advanced solid tumors.
PXD029071	35017479	Transglutaminase 3 crosslinks the secreted gel-forming mucus component Mucin-2 and stabilizes the colonic mucus layer. 	Transglutaminase 3 crosslinks MUC2 and stabilizes the colonic mucus layer	MUC2, Mucus, transglutaminase	The colonic mucus layer is organized as a two-layered system providing a physical barrier against pathogens and simultaneously harboring the commensal flora. The factors contributing to the organization of this gel network are not well understood. In this study, the impact of transglutaminase activity on this architecture was analyzed. Here, we show that transglutaminase TGM3 is the major transglutaminase-isoform expressed and synthesized in the colon. Furthermore, intrinsic extracellular transglutaminase activity in the secreted mucus was demonstrated in vitro and ex vivo. Absence of this acyl-transferase activity resulted in faster degradation of the major mucus component the MUC2 mucin and changed the biochemical properties of mucus. Finally, TGM3-deficient mice showed an early increased susceptibility to Dextran Sodium Sulfate-induced colitis. Here, we report that natural isopeptide cross-linking by TGM3 is important for mucus homeostasis and protection of the colon from inflammation, reducing the risk of colitis.
PXD029922	35017648	GSNOR regulates ganoderic acid content in Ganoderma lucidum under heat stress through S-nitrosylation of catalase. 	Proteomic analysis of CAT protein	S-nitrosylation	As a master regulator of the balance between NO signaling and protein S-nitrosylation, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase (GSNOR) is involved in various developmental processes and stress responses. However, the proteins and specific sites that can be S-nitrosylated, especially in microorganisms, and the physiological functions of S-nitrosylated proteins remain unclear. Herein, we show that the ganoderic acid (GA) content in GSNOR-silenced (GSNORi) strains is significantly lower (by 25%) than in wild type (WT) under heat stress (HS). Additionally, silencing GSNOR results in an 80% increase in catalase (CAT) activity, which consequently decreases GA accumulation via inhibition of ROS signaling. The mechanism of GSNOR-mediated control of CAT activity may be via protein S-nitrosylation. In support of this possibility, we show that CAT is S-nitrosylated (as shown via recombinant protein in vitro and via GSNORi strains in vivo). Additionally, Cys (cysteine) 401, Cys642 and Cys653 in CAT are S-nitrosylation sites (assayed via mass spectrometry analysis), and Cys401 may play a pivotal role in CAT activity. These findings indicate a mechanism by which GSNOR responds to stress and regulates secondary metabolite content through protein S-nitrosylation. Our results also define a new S-nitrosylation site and the function of an S-nitrosylated protein regulated by GSNOR in microorganisms.
PXD025892	35018412	Comparing the contents, functions and neonicotinoid take-up between floral and extrafloral nectar within a single species (Hemerocallis citrina Baroni). 	Shotgun proteome analysis of Hemerocallis citrina floral and extrafloral nectar	Hemerocallis citrina, extrafloral nectar, floral, nectarin	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many angiosperms can secrete both floral (FN) and extrafloral (EFN) nectar. However, much remains unclear about how EFN and FN differ in secretion, composition and ecological function, especially when both FN and EFN are secreted on flowers of the same species. METHODS: Hemerocallis citrina flowers secrete both FN and EFN. The FN and EFN traits including volume, presentation pattern and temporal rhythms of secretion were compared by field observation. Sugar and amino acid contents were analysed using regular biochemical methods, whereas the proteome was investigated by combined gel-based and gel-free approaches. Animal feeders on FN and EFN were investigated by field observation. Hemerocallis citrina plants were exposed by soil drenching to two systemic insecticides, acetamiprid and imidacloprid, and the concentration of these in FN and EFN was measured by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. KEY RESULTS: Hemerocallis citrina FN was concentrated and sucrose dominant, secreted in the mature flower tube and served as a reward for pollinators. Conversely, EFN was hexose rich, more dilute and less rich in sugar and amino acids. EFN was secreted on the outside of developing floral buds, and was likely to attract predatory animals for defence. EFN had fewer phenolics, but more pathogenesis-related components, such as chitinase and glucanase. A significantly different proteomic profile and enzymatic activities between FN and EFN suggest that they had different biosynthesis mechanisms. Both neonicotinoid insecticides examined became present in both nectar types soon after application, but in greater concentration within EFN; EFN also attracted a wider range of insect species than FN. CONCLUSIONS: Hemerocallis citrina FN and EFN differed in production, composition and ecological function. The EFN pathway could be a significant way for neonicotinoids to enter the wild food chain, and must be considered when evaluating the risks to the environment of other systemic insecticides.
PXD029787	35018528	Removal of antibiotic thiamphenicol by bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila HS01. 	Removal of antibiotic Thiamphenicol by bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila	Aeromonas hydrophila, Antibiotic bioremediation, Thiamphenicol	Thiamphenicol (TAP) is an amphenicol antibiotic, which has a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect on both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Since it is widely used in animals and aquaculture, its residues in environment may bring potential risk for human health and ecosystems. While TAP can be removed through conventional physical or chemical methods, its bioremediation using microorganisms is less studied. Here, we report the removal of TAP by a bacterial strain, Aeromonas hydrophila HS01, which can remove more than 90.0% of TAP in a living cell-dependent manner. Our results indicated that its removal efficiency can be greatly affected by the growth condition. Proteomics studies revealed a number of differentially expressed proteins of HS01 in the presence of TAP, which may play critical roles in the transportation and degradation of TAP. All these results indicate bacterial strain A. hydrophila HS01 is a new microbial resource for efficiently removing TAP, and may shed new insights in developing bioremediation approaches for TAP pollution.
PXD029978	35019708	The Mechanism of Action of Ginkgolic Acid (15:1) against Gram-Positive Bacteria Involves Cross Talk with Iron Homeostasis. 	Quantitative label-free proteomic comparison of the omadacycline-induced E. faecium isolates vs initial separation	E. faecium, label-free proteomic, omadacycline	With the increasing reports of community-acquired and nosocomial infection caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, there is an urgent need to develop new antimicrobial agents with novel antibacterial mechanisms. Here, we investigated the antibacterial activity of the natural product ginkgolic acid (GA) (15:1), derived from Ginkgo biloba, and its potential mode of action against the Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC values of GA (15:1) against clinical E. faecalis and S. aureus isolates from China were <=4 and <=8 mug/mL, respectively, from our test results. Moreover, GA (15:1) displayed high efficiency in biofilm formation inhibition and bactericidal activity against E. faecalis and S. aureus. During its inhibition of the planktonic bacteria, the antibacterial activity of GA (15:1) was significantly improved under the condition of abolishing iron homeostasis. When iron homeostasis was abolished, inhibition of planktonic bacteria by GA (15:1) was significantly improved. This phenomenon can be interpreted as showing that iron homeostasis disruption facilitated the disruption of the functions of ribosome and protein synthesis by GA (15:1), resulting in inhibition of bacterial growth and cell death. Genetic mutation of ferric uptake regulator (Fur) led to GA (15:1) tolerance in in vitro-induced resistant derivatives, while overexpression of Fur led to increased GA (15:1) susceptibility. Additionally, GA (15:1) significantly decreased the bacterial loads of S. aureus strain USA300 in the lung tissues of mice in a pneumonic murine model. Conclusively, this study revealed an antimicrobial mechanism of GA (15:1) involving cross talk with iron homeostasis against Gram-positive pathogens. In the future, the natural product GA (15:1) might be applied to combat infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens. IMPORTANCE The increasing emergence of infectious diseases associated with multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens has raised the urgent need to develop novel antibiotics. GA (15:1) is a natural product derived from Ginkgo biloba and possesses a wide range of bioactivities, including antimicrobial activity. However, its antibacterial mechanisms remain unclear. Our current study found that the function of ferric uptake regulator (Fur) was highly correlated with the antimicrobial activity of GA (15:1) against E. faecalis and that the antibacterial activity of GA (15:1) could be strengthened by the disruption of iron homeostasis. This study provided important insight into the mode of action of GA (15:1) against Gram-positive bacteria and suggested that GA (15:1) holds the potential to be an antimicrobial treatment option for infection caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
PXD022411	35019858	Multiomic Profiling of Central Nervous System Leukemia Identifies mRNA Translation as a Therapeutic Target. 	Central nervous system involvement of acute lymphoblastic leukemia depends on mRNA translation and complement component 3	LC-MS, LFQ, leukemia	Central nervous system (CNS) dissemination of B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has poor prognosis and remains a therapeutic challenge. Here we performed targeted DNA sequencing as well as transcriptional and proteomic profiling of paired leukemia-infiltrating cells in the bone marrow (BM) and CNS of xenografts. Genes governing mRNA translation were upregulated in CNS leukemia, and subclonal genetic profiling confirmed this in both BM-concordant and BM-discordant CNS mutational populations. CNS leukemia cells were exquisitely sensitive to the translation inhibitor omacetaxine mepesuccinate, which reduced xenograft leptomeningeal disease burden. Proteomics demonstrated greater abundance of secreted proteins in CNS-infiltrating cells, including complement component 3 (C3), and drug targeting of C3 influenced CNS disease in xenografts. CNS-infiltrating cells also exhibited selection for stemness traits and metabolic reprogramming. Overall, our study identifies targeting of mRNA translation as a potential therapeutic approach for B-ALL leptomeningeal disease. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer metastases are often driven by distinct subclones with unique biological properties. Here we show that in B-ALL CNS disease, the leptomeningeal environment selects for cells with unique functional dependencies. Pharmacologic inhibition of mRNA translation signaling treats CNS disease and offers a new therapeutic approach for this condition.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1.
PXD018005	35019937	Regulating peroxisome-ER contacts via the ACBD5-VAPB tether by FFAT motif phosphorylation and GSK3beta. 	ACBD5 phosphorylationsite analysis	ACBD5, COS7 cells, phosphorylation	Peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cooperate in cellular lipid metabolism. They form membrane contacts through interaction of the peroxisomal membrane protein ACBD5 (acyl-coenzyme A-binding domain protein 5) and the ER-resident protein VAPB (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B). ACBD5 binds to the major sperm protein domain of VAPB via its FFAT-like (two phenylalanines [FF] in an acidic tract) motif. However, molecular mechanisms, which regulate formation of these membrane contact sites, are unknown. Here, we reveal that peroxisome-ER associations via the ACBD5-VAPB tether are regulated by phosphorylation. We show that ACBD5-VAPB binding is phosphatase-sensitive and identify phosphorylation sites in the flanking regions and core of the FFAT-like motif, which alter interaction with VAPB-and thus peroxisome-ER contact sites-differently. Moreover, we demonstrate that GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta) regulates this interaction. Our findings reveal for the first time a molecular mechanism for the regulation of peroxisome-ER contacts in mammalian cells and expand the current model of FFAT motifs and VAP interaction.
PXD020541	35020128	An In-depth Proteomic Map of Leishmania donovani Isolate from Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) Patient. 	A Proteomic map of Leishmania donovani isolate from post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patient	Kala-azar, cutaneous leishmaniasis, intracellular parasite, kinetoplastids, phagolysosome	BACKGROUND: The trypanosomatid protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani is the etiological agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar. The patients that have undergone treatment may still harbor the parasite and in a small fraction of the patients the disease re-erupts in the form of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). PKDL is a pathological condition found to be intermediate between VL and complete cure of VL. The PKDL disease progression is determined by the host immune response to L. donovani. The majority of the proteomic studies on L. donovani till date have been undertaken on parasites either isolated from kala-azar patients or on established laboratory strains of L. donovani. However, no proteomic information is available on the cutaneous localized isolates of L. donovani from PKDL patients. METHODS: The promastigote stage of L. donovani isolate from PKDL patient was cultured and harvested. The cell lysates were trypsin digested, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The LC-MS/MS raw data were analyzed on Proteome Discoverer. Further bioinformatics analysis was carried out. RESULTS: In the present, we have used high-resolution mass spectrometry to map the global proteome of a L. donovani isolate from PKDL patient. This in-depth study resulted in the identification of 5537 unique proteins from PKDL isolate of L. donovani which covered 64% of its proteome. OUTCOME: This study also identified proteins previously shown to be upregulated in PKDL L. donovani. This is the most in-depth proteome of Leishmania donovani parasite till date.
PXD023133	35020422	Tumor collection/processing under physioxia uncovers highly relevant signaling networks and drug sensitivity. 	Tumor tissue collection and processing under physioxia allows highly relevant detection of signaling networks and drug sensitivity of cancer cells	tumor	Preclinical studies of primary cancer cells are typically done after tumors are removed from patients or animals at ambient atmospheric oxygen (O2, ~21%). However, O2 concentrations in organs are in the ~3 to 10% range, with most tumors in a hypoxic or 1 to 2% O2 environment in vivo. Although effects of O2 tension on tumor cell characteristics in vitro have been studied, these studies are done only after tumors are first collected and processed in ambient air. Similarly, sensitivity of primary cancer cells to anticancer agents is routinely examined at ambient O2. Here, we demonstrate that tumors collected, processed, and propagated at physiologic O2 compared to ambient air display distinct differences in key signaling networks including LGR5/WNT, YAP, and NRF2/KEAP1, nuclear reactive oxygen species, alternative splicing, and sensitivity to targeted therapies. Therefore, evaluating cancer cells under physioxia could more closely recapitulate their physiopathologic status in the in vivo microenvironment.
PXD025310	35021987	Aird: a computation-oriented mass spectrometry data format enables a higher compression ratio and less decoding time. 	Aird: A computation-oriented mass spectrometry data format enables a higher compression ratio and less decoding time	Aird, DDA, DIA, Metabolomics, PRM	BACKGROUND: With the precision of the mass spectrometry (MS) going higher, the MS file size increases rapidly. Beyond the widely-used open format mzML, near-lossless or lossless compression algorithms and formats emerged in scenarios with different precision requirements. The data precision is often related to the instrument and subsequent processing algorithms. Unlike storage-oriented formats, which focus more on lossless compression rate, computation-oriented formats concentrate as much on decoding speed as the compression rate. RESULTS: Here we introduce "Aird", an opensource and computation-oriented format with controllable precision, flexible indexing strategies, and high compression rate. Aird provides a novel compressor called Zlib-Diff-PforDelta (ZDPD) for m/z data. Compared with Zlib only, m/z data size is about 55% lower in Aird average. With the high-speed decoding and encoding performance of the single instruction multiple data technology used in the ZDPD, Aird merely takes 33% decoding time compared with Zlib. We have downloaded seven datasets from ProteomeXchange and Metabolights. They are from different SCIEX, Thermo, and Agilent instruments. Then we convert the raw data into mzML, mgf, and mz5 file formats by MSConvert and compare them with Aird format. Aird uses JavaScript Object Notation for metadata storage. Aird-SDK is written in Java, and AirdPro is a GUI client for vendor file converting written in C#. They are freely available at https://github.com/CSi-Studio/Aird-SDK and https://github.com/CSi-Studio/AirdPro . CONCLUSIONS: With the innovation of MS acquisition mode, MS data characteristics are also constantly changing. New data features can bring more effective compression methods and new index modes to achieve high search performance. The MS data storage mode will also become professional and customized. ZDPD uses multiple MS digital features, and researchers also can use it in other formats like mzML. Aird is designed to become a computing-oriented data format with high scalability, compression rate, and fast decoding speed.
PXD023911	35022314	Integrated Proteomics-Based Physical and Functional Mapping of AXL Kinase Signaling Pathways and Inhibitors Define Its Role in Cell Migration. 	Integrated proteomics-based physical and functional mapping of AXL kinase signaling pathways and inhibitors define its role in cell migration: BioID	AXL Tyrosine Kinase, BioID, Lung Cancer, Targeted Therapy	To better understand the signaling complexity of AXL, a member of the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) receptor tyrosine kinase family, we created a physical and functional map of AXL signaling interactions, phosphorylation events, and target-engagement of three AXL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). We assessed AXL protein complexes using proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID), effects of AXL TKI on global phosphoproteins using mass spectrometry, and target engagement of AXL TKI using activity-based protein profiling. BioID identifies AXL-interacting proteins that are mostly involved in cell adhesion/migration. Global phosphoproteomics show that AXL inhibition decreases phosphorylation of peptides involved in phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling and cell adhesion/migration. Comparison of three AXL inhibitors reveals that TKI RXDX-106 inhibits pAXL, pAKT, and migration/invasion of these cells without reducing their viability, while bemcentinib exerts AXL-independent phenotypic effects on viability. Proteomic characterization of these TKIs demonstrates that they inhibit diverse targets in addition to AXL, with bemcentinib having the most off-targets. AXL and EGFR TKI cotreatment did not reverse resistance in cell line models of erlotinib resistance. However, a unique vulnerability was identified in one resistant clone, wherein combination of bemcentinib and erlotinib inhibited cell viability and signaling. We also show that AXL is overexpressed in approximately 30% to 40% of nonsmall but rarely in small cell lung cancer. Cell lines have a wide range of AXL expression, with basal activation detected rarely. IMPLICATIONS: Our study defines mechanisms of action of AXL in lung cancers which can be used to establish assays to measure drug targetable active AXL complexes in patient tissues and inform the strategy for targeting it's signaling as an anticancer therapy.
PXD026888	35022393	Danger signal extracellular calcium initiates differentiation of monocytes into SPP1/osteopontin-producing macrophages. 	Proteomic characterization of calcium macrophages	Calcium, Macrophages, Rheumatoid Arthritis	The danger signal extracellular calcium is pathophysiologically increased in the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Calcium activates the NLRP3-inflammasome via the calcium-sensing receptor in monocytes/macrophages primed by lipopolysaccharide, and this effect is mediated by the uptake of calciprotein particles (CPPs) formed out of calcium, phosphate, and fetuin-A. Aim of the study was to unravel the influence of calcium on monocytes when the priming signal is not present. Monocytes were isolated from the blood of healthy controls and RA patients. Macrophages were characterized using scRNA-seq, DNA microarray, and proteomics. Imaging flow cytometry was utilized to study intracellular events. Here we show that extracellular calcium and CPPs lead to the differentiation of monocytes into calcium-macrophages when the priming signal is absent. Additional growth factors are not needed, and differentiation is triggered by calcium-dependent CPP-uptake, lysosomal alkalization due to CPP overload, and TFEB- and STAT3-dependent increased transcription of the lysosomal gene network. Calcium-macrophages have a needle-like shape, are characterized by excessive, constitutive SPP1/osteopontin production and a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Calcium-macrophages differentiated out of RA monocytes show a stronger manifestation of this phenotype, suggesting the differentiation process might lead to the pro-inflammatory macrophage response seen in the RA synovial membrane.
PXD027355	35022408	Genetic alterations of the SUMO isopeptidase SENP6 drive lymphomagenesis and genetic instability in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 	Proteomes of chromatin fractions derived from SU-DHL-5 cells	SU-DHL-5 cells (B-cell lymphoma)	SUMOylation is a post-translational modification of proteins that regulates these proteins' localization, turnover or function. Aberrant SUMOylation is frequently found in cancers but its origin remains elusive. Using a genome-wide transposon mutagenesis screen in a MYC-driven B-cell lymphoma model, we here identify the SUMO isopeptidase (or deconjugase) SENP6 as a tumor suppressor that links unrestricted SUMOylation to tumor development and progression. Notably, SENP6 is recurrently deleted in human lymphomas and SENP6 deficiency results in unrestricted SUMOylation. Mechanistically, SENP6 loss triggers release of DNA repair- and genome maintenance-associated protein complexes from chromatin thereby impairing DNA repair in response to DNA damages and ultimately promoting genomic instability. In line with this hypothesis, SENP6 deficiency drives synthetic lethality to Poly-ADP-Ribose-Polymerase (PARP) inhibition. Together, our results link SENP6 loss to defective genome maintenance and reveal the potential therapeutic application of PARP inhibitors in B-cell lymphoma.
PXD026900	35024855	Pathogenic SLC25A26 variants impair SAH transport activity causing mitochondrial disease. 	A patient-based Drosophila model for mitochondrial S-Adenosylhomocysteine transport deficiency	Drosophila, SAH, SAM, SAMC, SLC25A26, methylation, mitochondria	The SLC25A26 gene encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane carrier that transports S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) into the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAM is the predominant methyl-group donor for most cellular methylation processes, of which SAH is produced as a by-product. Pathogenic, biallelic SLC25A26 variants are a recognized cause of mitochondrial disease in children, with a severe neonatal onset caused by decreased SAM transport activity. Here, we describe two, unrelated adult cases, one of whom presented with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain and metabolic decompensation with lactic acidosis. Both patients had exercise intolerance and mitochondrial myopathy associated with biallelic variants in SLC25A26, which led to marked respiratory chain deficiencies and mitochondrial histopathological abnormalities in skeletal muscle that are comparable to those previously described in early-onset cases. We demonstrate using both mouse and fruit fly models that impairment of SAH, rather than SAM, transport across the mitochondrial membrane is likely the cause of this milder, late-onset phenotype. Our findings associate a novel pathomechanism with a known disease-causing protein and highlight the quests of precision medicine in optimizing diagnosis, therapeutic intervention and prognosis.
PXD029282	35025051	Studies on Regulation of Global Protein Profile and Cellular Bioenergetics of Differentiating SH-SY5Y Cells. 	Quantitative proteomics study on RA+BDNF induced SHSY5Y differentiation	Mitochondrial bioenergetics, SHSY5Y differentiation	The SH-SY5Y cells differentiated by sequential exposure of retinoic acid (RA) and brain-derived neurotrophic growth factor (BDNF) are a well-employed cellular model for studying the mechanistic aspects of neural development and neurodegeneration. Earlier studies from our lab have identified dramatic upregulation (77 miRNAs) and downregulation (17 miRNAs) of miRNAs in SH-SY5Y cells differentiated with successive exposure of RA + BDNF and demonstrated the essential role of increased levels of P53 proteins in coping with the differentiation-induced changes in protein levels. In continuation to our earlier studies, we have performed unbiased LC-MS/MS global protein profiling of naive and differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and analyzed the identified proteins in reference to miRNAs identified in our earlier studies to identify the cellular events regulated by both identified miRNAs and proteins. Analysis of LC-MS/MS data has shown a significant increase and decrease in levels of 215 and 163 proteins, respectively, in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Integrative analysis of miRNA identified in our previous studies and protein identified in the present study is carried out to discover novel miRNA-protein regulatory modules to elucidate miRNA-protein regulatory relationships of differentiating neurons. In silico network analysis of miRNAs and proteins deregulated upon SH-SY5Y differentiation identified cell cycle, synapse formation, axonogenesis, differentiation, neuron projection, and neurotransmission, as the topmost involved pathways. Further, measuring mitochondrial dynamics and cellular bioenergetics using qPCR and Seahorse XFp Flux Analyzer, respectively, showed that differentiated cells possess increased mitochondrial dynamics and OCR relative to undifferentiated cells. In summary, our studies have identified a novel set of proteins deregulated during neuronal differentiation and establish the role of miRNAs identified in earlier studies in the regulation of proteins identified by LC-MS/MS-based global profiling of differentiating neurons, which will help in future studies related to neural development and neurodegeneration.
PXD024491	35025629	Mitochondria shed their outer membrane in response to infection-induced stress. 	Mitochondria shed large SPOTs during infection-induced import stress to remodel their outer membrane	Mitochondria, TMT, Toxoplasma, label-free	The outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is essential for cellular homeostasis. Yet little is known of the mechanisms that remodel it during natural stresses. We found that large "SPOTs" (structures positive for OMM) emerge during Toxoplasma gondii infection in mammalian cells. SPOTs mediated the depletion of the OMM proteins mitofusin 1 and 2, which restrict parasite growth. The formation of SPOTs depended on the parasite effector TgMAF1 and the host mitochondrial import receptor TOM70, which is required for optimal parasite proliferation. TOM70 enabled TgMAF1 to interact with the host OMM translocase SAM50. The ablation of SAM50 or the overexpression of an OMM-targeted protein promoted OMM remodeling independently of infection. Thus, Toxoplasma hijacks the formation of SPOTs, a cellular response to OMM stress, to promote its growth.
PXD029519	35026224	During FeS cluster biogenesis, ferredoxin and frataxin use overlapping binding sites on yeast cysteine desulfurase Nfs1. 	Overlapping binding site for ferredoxin and frataxin on yeast cysteine desulfurase participating in FeS cluster biogenesis	iron-sulfur protein, protein complex	In mitochondria, cysteine desulfurase (Nfs1) plays a central role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters, cofactors critical for activity of many cellular proteins. Nfs1 functions both as a sulfur donor for cluster assembly and as a binding platform for other proteins functioning in the process. These include not only the dedicated scaffold protein (Isu1) on which FeS clusters are synthesized but also accessory FeS cluster biogenesis proteins frataxin (Yfh1) and ferredoxin (Yah1). Yfh1 has been shown to activate cysteine desulfurase enzymatic activity, whereas Yah1 supplies electrons for the persulfide reduction. While Yfh1 interaction with Nfs1 is well understood, the Yah1-Nfs1 interaction is not. Here, based on the results of biochemical experiments involving purified WT and variant proteins, we report that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yah1 and Yfh1 share an evolutionary conserved interaction site on Nfs1. Consistent with this notion, Yah1 and Yfh1 can each displace the other from Nfs1 but are inefficient competitors when a variant with an altered interaction site is used. Thus, the binding mode of Yah1 and Yfh1 interacting with Nfs1 in mitochondria of S. cerevisiae resembles the mutually exclusive binding of ferredoxin and frataxin with cysteine desulfurase reported for the bacterial FeS cluster assembly system. Our findings are consistent with the generally accepted scenario that the mitochondrial FeS cluster assembly system was inherited from bacterial ancestors of mitochondria.
PXD027553	35027052	Proteome evaluation of homolog abundance patterns in Arachis hypogaea cv. Tifrunner. 	Proteom datasets of Arachis hypogaea cv. Tifrunner under normal growth conditions	leaf, root	BACKGROUND: Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea, AABB genome), an allotetraploid from a cross between A. duranensis (AA genome) and A. ipaensis (BB genome), is an important oil and protein crop with released genome and RNA-seq sequence datasets. These datasets provide the molecular foundation for studying gene expression and evolutionary patterns. However, there are no reports on the proteomic data of A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner, which limits understanding of its gene function and protein level evolution. RESULTS: This study sequenced the A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner leaf and root proteome using the tandem mass tag technology. A total of 4803 abundant proteins were identified. The 364 differentially abundant proteins were estimated by comparing protein abundances between leaf and root proteomes. The differentially abundant proteins enriched the photosystem process. The number of biased abundant homeologs between the two sub-genomes A (87 homeologs in leaf and root) and B (69 and 68 homeologs in leaf and root, respectively) was not significantly different. However, homeologous proteins with biased abundances in different sub-genomes enriched different biological processes. In the leaf, homeologs biased to sub-genome A enriched biosynthetic and metabolic process, while homeologs biased to sub-genome B enriched iron ion homeostasis process. In the root, homeologs with biased abundance in sub-genome A enriched inorganic biosynthesis and metabolism process, while homeologs with biased abundance in sub-genome B enriched organic biosynthesis and metabolism process. Purifying selection mainly acted on paralogs and homeologs. The selective pressure values were negatively correlated with paralogous protein abundance. About 77.42% (24/31) homeologous and 80% (48/60) paralogous protein pairs had asymmetric abundance, and several protein pairs had conserved abundances in the leaf and root tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study sequenced the proteome of A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner using the leaf and root tissues. Differentially abundant proteins were identified, and revealed functions. Paralog abundance divergence and homeolog bias abundance was elucidated. These results indicate that divergent abundance caused retention of homologs in A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner.
PXD024966	35027445	Lyso-Lipid-Induced Oligodendrocyte Maturation Underlies Restoration of Optic Nerve Function. 	EAE Optic Nerve Injections with LPC 18:1 (iTRAQ)	EAE, LPC 18:1, Multiple Sclerosis, iTRAQ	Protein hyperdeimination and deficiency of lyso-phospholipids (LPC 18:1) has been associated with the pathology of demyelinating disease in both humans and mice. We uncovered interesting biology of LPC 18:1, in which LPC 18:1 induced optic nerve function restoration through oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination in mouse model systems. Our in vitro studies show LPC 18:1 protection against neuron-ectopic hyperdeimination and stimulation of oligodendrocyte maturation, while in vivo investigations recorded optic nerve function improvement following optic nerve injections of LPC 18:1, in contrast with LPC 18:0. Thus, just a change in a single bond renders a dramatic alternation in biological function. The incorporation of isobaric C13-histidine in newly synthesized myelin proteins and quantitative proteome shifts are consistent with remyelination underlying restoration in optic nerve function. These results suggest that exogenous LPC 18:1 may provide a therapeutic avenue for stemming vision loss in demyelinating diseases.
PXD024998	35027576	Similar neuronal imprint and no cross-seeded fibrils in alpha-synuclein aggregates from MSA and Parkinson's disease. 	Analysis of the sarkosyl-insoluble proteomes of Parkinson's disease and Multiple System Atrophy subject brain samples	Multiple System Atrophy, Parkinson's disease, alpha-synuclein, insoluble proteome, protein aggregates	Aggregated alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is a principal constituent of Lewy bodies (LBs) and glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) observed respectively inside neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) and oligodendrocytes in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Yet, the cellular origin, the pathophysiological role, and the mechanism of formation of these inclusions bodies (IBs) remain to be elucidated. It has recently been proposed that alpha-syn IBs eventually cause the demise of the host cell by virtue of the cumulative sequestration of partner proteins and organelles. In particular, the hypothesis of a local cross-seeding of other fibrillization-prone proteins like tau or TDP-43 has also been put forward. We submitted sarkosyl-insoluble extracts of post-mortem brain tissue from PD, MSA and control subjects to a comparative proteomic analysis to address these points. Our studies indicate that: (i) alpha-syn is by far the most enriched protein in PD and MSA extracts compared to controls; (ii) PD and MSA extracts share a striking overlap of their sarkosyl-insoluble proteomes, consisting of a vast majority of mitochondrial and neuronal synaptic proteins, and (iii) other fibrillization-prone protein candidates possibly cross-seeded by alpha-syn are neither found in PD nor MSA extracts. Thus, our results (i) support the idea that pre-assembled building blocks originating in neurons serve to the formation of GCIs in MSA, (ii) show no sign of amyloid cross-seeding in either synucleinopathy, and (iii) point to the sequestration of mitochondria and of neuronal synaptic components in both LBs and GCIs.
PXD028283	35027645	Single-cell transcriptomics of human iPSC differentiation dynamics reveal a core molecular network of Parkinson's disease. 	Â¬Single cell transcriptomics of human iPSC differentiation dynamics reveal a core network of Parkinson's disease	Parkinson's disease, iPSCs, shotgun	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons (mDA) in the midbrain. The underlying mechanisms are only partly understood and there is no treatment to reverse PD progression. Here, we investigated the disease mechanism using mDA neurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) carrying the ILE368ASN mutation within the PINK1 gene, which is strongly associated with PD. Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and gene expression analysis of a PINK1-ILE368ASN and a control cell line identified genes differentially expressed during mDA neuron differentiation. Network analysis revealed that these genes form a core network, members of which interact with all known 19 protein-coding Parkinson's disease-associated genes. This core network encompasses key PD-associated pathways, including ubiquitination, mitochondrial function, protein processing, RNA metabolism, and vesicular transport. Proteomics analysis showed a consistent alteration in proteins of dopamine metabolism, indicating a defect of dopaminergic metabolism in PINK1-ILE368ASN neurons. Our findings suggest the existence of a network onto which pathways associated with PD pathology converge, and offers an inclusive interpretation of the phenotypic heterogeneity of PD.
PXD027904	35028529	Nicotinamide riboside supplementation confers marginal metabolic benefits in obese mice without remodeling the muscle acetyl-proteome. 	Nicotinamide riboside supplementation confers modest effects on skeletal muscle metabolism without mitochondrial and acetyl-proteome remodelingNicotinamide riboside supplementation confers modest effects on skeletal muscle metabolism without mitochondrial	Mitochondria, Nicotinamide riboside supplements, acetylation	Nicotinamide riboside supplements (NRS) have been touted as a nutraceutical that promotes cardiometabolic and musculoskeletal health by enhancing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) biosynthesis, mitochondrial function, and/or the activities of NAD-dependent sirtuin deacetylase enzymes. This investigation examined the impact of NRS on whole body energy homeostasis, skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, and corresponding shifts in the acetyl-lysine proteome, in the context of diet-induced obesity using C57BL/6NJ mice. The study also included a genetically modified mouse model that imposes greater demand on sirtuin flux and associated NAD(+) consumption, specifically within muscle tissues. In general, whole body glucose control was marginally improved by NRS when administered at the midpoint of a chronic high-fat diet, but not when given as a preventative therapy upon initiation of the diet. Contrary to anticipated outcomes, the study produced little evidence that NRS increases tissue NAD(+) levels, augments mitochondrial function, and/or mitigates diet-induced hyperacetylation of the skeletal muscle proteome.
PXD003144	35028803	Enrichment of Newly Synthesized Proteins following treatment of C2C12 Myotubes with Endotoxin and Interferon-gamma. 	Measuring C2C12 Myotube Protein Expression Changes in Inflammation using Punch-P	5600 TripleTOF, LPS, inflammatio, interferon gamma, muscle, myotubes	Inflammation in muscle induces the synthesis of mediators that can impair protein synthesis and enhance proteolysis, and when sustained lead to muscle atrophy. Furthermore, muscle-derived mediators that are secreted may participate in disrupting the function of other peripheral organs. Selective identification of newly synthesized proteins can provide insight on biological processes that depend on the continued synthesis of specific proteins to maintain homeostasis as well as those proteins that are up- or down-regulated in response to inflammation. We used puromycin-associated nascent chain proteomics (PUNCH-P) to characterize new protein synthesis in C2C12 myotubes and changes resulting from their exposure to the inflammatory mediators lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon (IFN)-gamma for either a short (4 h) or prolonged (16 h) time period. We identified sequences of nascent polypeptide chains belonging to a total of 1523 proteins and report their detection from three independent samples of each condition at each time point. The identified nascent proteins correspond to approximately 15% of presently known proteins in C2C12 myotubes and are enriched in specific cellular components and pathways. A subset of these proteins was identified only in treated samples and has functional characteristics consistent with the synthesis of specific new proteins in response to LPS/IFNgamma. Thus, the identification of proteins from their nascent polypeptide chains provides a resource to analyze the role of new synthesis of proteins in both protein homeostasis and in proteome responses to stimuli in C2C12 myotubes. Our results reveal a profile of actively translating proteins for specific cellular components and biological processes in normal C2C12 myotubes and a different enrichment of proteins in response to LPS/IFNgamma. Collectively, our data disclose a highly interconnected network that integrates the regulation of cellular proteostasis and reveal a diverse immune response to inflammation in muscle which may underlie the concomitantly observed atrophy and be important in inter-organ communication.
PXD029571	35030987	Comparative secretome analysis of Staphylococcus aureus strains with different within-herd intramammary infection prevalence. 	Comparative secretome analysis of Staphylococcus aureus strains with different within-herd intramammary infection prevalence	Biological dataset, Label-free proteomics, bacterial virulence, mammary gland, mastitis	Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen causing intramammary infection and mastitis in dairy cows. S. aureus genotypes (GT) can differ significantly in their ability to diffuse and persist in the herd; while the association of virulence gene carriage with epidemiological behavior remains unclear, a role for secreted proteins has been postulated. We characterized the secretome of six S. aureus strains belonging to two genotypes with opposite within-herd prevalence, GTB (high) and GTS (low), corresponding to sequence types (ST) 8 and 398, by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry and differential analysis with Proteome Discoverer. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD029571. Out of 720 identified proteins, 98 were unique or more abundant in GTB/ST8 and 68 in GTS/ST398. GTB/ST8 released more immunoglobulin-binding proteins, complement and antimicrobial peptide inhibitors, enterotoxins, and metabolic enzymes, while GTS/ST398 released more leukocidins, hemolysins, lipases, and peptidases. Furthermore, GTB/ST8 released the von Willebrand factor protein, staphylokinase, and clumping factor B, while GTS released the staphylococcal coagulase and clumping factor A. Hence, GTB/ST8 secretomes indicated a higher propensity for immune evasion and chronicity and GTS/ST398 secretomes for cellular damage and inflammation, consistent with their epidemiological characteristics. Accordingly, GTS/ST398 secretions were significantly more cytotoxic against bovine PBMCs in vitro. Our findings confirm the crucial role of extracellular virulence factors in S. aureus pathogenesis and highlight the need to investigate their differential release adding to gene carriage for a better understanding of the relationship of S. aureus genotypes with epidemiological behavior and, possibly, disease severity.
PXD020425	35031490	Integrated Application of Multiomics Strategies Provides Insights Into the Environmental Hypoxia Response in Pelteobagrus vachelli Muscle. 	The proteomic changes in Pseudobagrus vachelli muscle and brain induced by hypoxia	Muscle  and brain proteomics of Pseudobagrus fulvidraco	Increasing pressures on aquatic ecosystems because of pollutants, nutrient enrichment, and global warming have severely depleted oxygen concentrations. This sudden and significant lack of oxygen has resulted in persistent increases in fish mortality rates. Revealing the molecular mechanism of fish hypoxia adaptation will help researchers to find markers for hypoxia induced by environmental stress. Here, we used a multiomics approach to identify several hypoxia-associated miRNAs, mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites involved in diverse biological pathways in the muscles of Pelteobagrus vachelli. Our findings revealed significant hypoxia-associated changes in muscles over 4 h of hypoxia exposure and discrete tissue-specific patterns. We have previously reported that P. vachelli livers exhibit increased anaerobic glycolysis, heme synthesis, erythropoiesis, and inhibit apoptosis when exposed to hypoxia for 4 h. However, the opposite was observed in muscles. According to our comprehensive analysis, fishes show an acute response to hypoxia, including activation of catabolic pathways to generate more energy, reduction of biosynthesis to decrease energy consumption, and shifting from aerobic to anaerobic metabolic contributions. Also, we found that hypoxia induced muscle dysfunction by impairing mitochondrial function, activating inflammasomes, and apoptosis. The hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction enhanced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and further triggered interleukin-1beta production via inflammasome activation. In turn, interleukin-1beta further impaired mitochondrial function or apoptosis by suppressing downstream mitochondrial biosynthesis-related proteins, thus resulting in a vicious cycle of inflammasome activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings contribute meaningful insights into the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia, and the methods and study design can be utilized across different fish species.
PXD024373	35031618	HIF-1 Interacts with TRIM28 and DNA-PK to release paused RNA polymerase II and activate target gene transcription in response to hypoxia. 	Screening HIF-1 Cofactors in Breast Cancer Cells by RIME	Breast Cancer, HIF-1, RIME	Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that acts as a regulator of oxygen (O2) homeostasis in metazoan species by binding to hypoxia response elements (HREs) and activating the transcription of hundreds of genes in response to reduced O2 availability. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) initiates transcription of many HIF target genes under non-hypoxic conditions but pauses after approximately 30-60 nucleotides and requires HIF-1 binding for release. Here we report that in hypoxic breast cancer cells, HIF-1 recruits TRIM28 and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) to HREs to release paused Pol II. We show that HIF-1alpha and TRIM28 assemble the catalytically-active DNA-PK heterotrimer, which phosphorylates TRIM28 at serine-824, enabling recruitment of CDK9, which phosphorylates serine-2 of the Pol II large subunit C-terminal domain as well as the negative elongation factor to release paused Pol II, thereby stimulating productive transcriptional elongation. Our studies reveal a molecular mechanism by which HIF-1 stimulates gene transcription and reveal that the anticancer effects of drugs targeting DNA-PK in breast cancer may be due in part to their inhibition of HIF-dependent transcription.
PXD027980	35032194	Agonist-induced extracellular vesicles contribute to the transfer of functional bombesin receptor-subtype 3 to recipient cells. 	Proteomics analysis of extracellular vesicles	Bombesin receptor-subtype 3, Extracellular vesicles	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important carriers for biomolecules in the microenvironment that greatly promote intercellular and extracellular communications. However, it is unclear whether bombesin receptor-subtype 3 (BRS-3), an orphan G-protein coupled receptor, can be packed into EVs and functionally transferred to recipient cells. In this study, we applied the synthetic agonist and antagonist to activate and inhibit the BRS-3 in HEK293-BRS-3 cells, whose EVs release was BRS-3 activation dependent. The presence of BRS-3 in harvested EVs was further confirmed by an enhanced green fluorescent protein tag. After recipient cells were co-cultured with these EVs, the presence of BRS-3 in the recipient cells was discovered, whose function was experimentally validated. Quantitative proteomics approach was utilized to decipher the proteome of the EVs derived from HEK293-BRS-3 cells after different stimulations. More than 900 proteins were identified, including 51 systematically dysregulated EVs proteins. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that RhoA signaling pathway was as an essential player for the secretion of EVs. Selective inhibition of RhoA signaling pathway after BRS-3 activation dramatically reversed the increased secretion of EVs. Our data, collectively, demonstrated that EVs contributed to the transfer of functional BRS-3 to the recipient cells, whose secretion was partially regulated by RhoA signaling pathway.
PXD030024	35032548	Host E3 ligase HUWE1 attenuates the proapoptotic activity of the MERS-CoV accessory protein ORF3 by promoting its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. 	Mass spectrometry data of identified proteins of MERS-CoV ORF3 interacting protein	293T, Interacting proteins, MERS-CoV, ORF3	With the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronaviruses have begun to attract great attention across the world. Of the known human coronaviruses, however, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the most lethal. Coronavirus proteins can be divided into three groups: nonstructural proteins, structural proteins, and accessory proteins. While the number of each of these proteins varies greatly among different coronaviruses, accessory proteins are most closely related to the pathogenicity of the virus. We found for the first time that the ORF3 accessory protein of MERS-CoV, which closely resembles the ORF3a proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, has the ability to induce apoptosis in cells in a dose-dependent manner. Through bioinformatics analysis and validation, we revealed that ORF3 is an unstable protein and has a shorter half-life in cells compared to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a proteins. After screening, we identified a host E3 ligase, HUWE1, that specifically induces MERS-CoV ORF3 protein ubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This results in the diminished ability of ORF3 to induce apoptosis, which might partially explain the lower spread of MERS-CoV compared to other coronaviruses. In summary, this study reveals a pathological function of MERS-CoV ORF3 protein and identifies a potential host antiviral protein, HUWE1, with an ability to antagonize MERS-CoV pathogenesis by inducing ORF3 degradation, thus enriching our knowledge of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and suggesting new targets and strategies for clinical development of drugs for MERS-CoV treatment.
PXD029258	35033534	Methyl-lysine readers PHF20 and PHF20L1 define two distinct gene expression-regulating NSL complexes. 	PHF20 and PHF20L1 in NSL complex	AP-MS, PHF20, PHF20L1, U2OS	The methyl-lysine readers plant homeodomain finger protein 20 (PHF20) and its homolog PHF20-like protein 1 (PHF20L1) are known components of the nonspecific lethal (NSL) complex that regulates gene expression through its histone acetyltransferase activity. In the current model, both PHF homologs coexist in the same NSL complex, although this was not formally tested; nor have the functions of PHF20 and PHF20L1 regarding NSL complex integrity and transcriptional regulation been investigated. Here, we perform an in-depth biochemical and functional characterization of PHF20 and PHF20L1 in the context of the NSL complex. Using mass spectrometry, genome-wide chromatin analysis, and protein-domain mapping, we identify the existence of two distinct NSL complexes that exclusively contain either PHF20 or PHF20L1. We show that the C-terminal domains of PHF20 and PHF20L1 are essential for complex formation with NSL, and the Tudor 2 domains are required for chromatin binding. The genome-wide chromatin landscape of PHF20-PHF20L1 shows that these proteins bind mostly to the same genomic regions, at promoters of highly expressed/housekeeping genes. Yet, deletion of PHF20 and PHF20L1 does not abrogate gene expression or impact the recruitment of the NSL complex to those target gene promoters, suggesting the existence of an alternative mechanism that compensates for the transcription of genes whose sustained expression is important for critical cellular functions. This work shifts the current paradigm and lays the foundation for studies on the differential roles of PHF20 and PHF20L1 in regulating NSL complex activity in physiological and diseases states.
PXD029574	35033535	The METTL5-TRMT112 N(6)-methyladenosine methyltransferase complex regulates mRNA translation via 18S rRNA methylation. 	Identification of METTL5 interaction partners	METTL5	Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) have long been known to carry chemical modifications, including 2'O-methylation, pseudouridylation, N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), and N(6,6-)dimethyladenosine. While the functions of many of these modifications are unclear, some are highly conserved and occur in regions of the ribosome critical for mRNA decoding. Both 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA carry single m(6)A sites, and while the methyltransferase ZCCHC4 has been identified as the enzyme responsible for the 28S rRNA m(6)A modification, the methyltransferase responsible for the 18S rRNA m(6)A modification has remained unclear. Here, we show that the METTL5-TRMT112 methyltransferase complex installs the m(6)A modification at position 1832 of human 18S rRNA. Our work supports findings that TRMT112 is required for METTL5 stability and reveals that human METTL5 mutations associated with microcephaly and intellectual disability disrupt this interaction. We show that loss of METTL5 in human cancer cell lines and in mice regulates gene expression at the translational level; additionally, Mettl5 knockout mice display reduced body size and evidence of metabolic defects. While recent work has focused heavily on m(6)A modifications in mRNA and their roles in mRNA processing and translation, we demonstrate here that deorphanizing putative methyltransferase enzymes can reveal previously unappreciated regulatory roles for m(6)A in noncoding RNAs.
PXD025216	35036696	Outer Membrane Vesicles Secreted by Helicobacter pylori Transmitting Gastric Pathogenic Virulence Factors. 	The proteomic of Helicobacter pylori OMVs	Helicobacter pylori, OMVs	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is known to be a major pathogen causing gastric diseases through its direct localization in gastric epithelium cells. H. pylori releases outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) throughout the growth process. The content, function, and mechanism of H. pylori OMVs in gastric epithelial cells remain unclear. In this study, we extracted and characterized H. pylori OMVs of two strains (standard strain NCTC11637 and clinical strain Hp-400) and analyzed the specific content by proteomic technology. We identified more than 400 proteins in H. pylori OMVs. In addition, we investigated the impact of H. pylori OMVs on cellular functions by detecting proteomic changes in GES1 cells. GES1 cells cocultured with increasing concentrations of H. pylori OMVs were subjected to quantitative proteomic analyses using label-free methods for relative quantitation. The results showed that a total of 4261 proteins were verified, 153 of which were significantly altered in abundance when cocultured with NCTC11637 OMVs, and a total of 4234 proteins in Hp-400 OMVs, 390 of which were significantly altered. Gene ontology analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway mapping identified significantly altered inflammatory and cancer signaling pathways, including metabolic pathways and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, we explored the proteomic changes in GES1 cells induced by H. pylori. Bioinformatics analysis showed that changes in multiple pathways coincided with OMV-mediated proteomic changes. Based on these results, H. pylori induced pathogenicity in epithelial cells at least partially by secreting OMVs that mediated dramatic and specific proteomic changes in host cells. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD025216, PXD025259, and PXD025281.
PXD029323	35036865	Peptide ancestry informative markers in uterine neoplasms from women of European, African, and Asian ancestry. 	Peptide Ancestry Informative Markers in Uterine Neoplasms from Women of European, African and Asian Ancestry	Endometrial Cancer Cell Line, Fibroid, Quantitative Proteomics, TMT-10, TMT-11, Uterine Leiomyoma	Characterization of ancestry-linked peptide variants in disease-relevant patient tissues represents a foundational step to connect patient ancestry with disease pathogenesis. Nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms encoding missense substitutions within tryptic peptides exhibiting high allele frequencies in European, African, and East Asian populations, termed peptide ancestry informative markers (pAIMs), were prioritized from 1000 genomes. In silico analysis identified that as few as 20 pAIMs can determine ancestry proportions similarly to >260K SNPs (R(2) = 0.99). Multiplexed proteomic analysis of >100 human endometrial cancer cell lines and uterine leiomyoma tissues combined resulted in the quantitation of 62 pAIMs that correlate with patient race and genotype-confirmed ancestry. Candidates include a D451E substitution in GC vitamin D-binding protein previously associated with altered vitamin D levels in African and European populations. pAIMs will support generalized proteoancestry assessment as well as efforts investigating the impact of ancestry on the human proteome and how this relates to the pathogenesis of uterine neoplasms.
PXD026512	35036867	WASH interacts with Ku to regulate DNA double-stranded break repair. 	WASH pulldown proteomics analysis	293T, IP-MS, WASH	The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homolog (WASH), an actin nucleation-promoting factor, is present in the nucleus where it regulates gene transcription and maintains nuclear organization. Here, we show that WASH interacts with core non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) factors including Ku70/Ku80 and DNA-PKcs, and Ku70/Ku80 is involved in the recruitment of WASH to the sites of DNA double-stranded break (DSB). WASH depletion leads to increased cell sensitivity and impaired DNA repair capacity in response to etoposide-induced DSBs and reduces NHEJ efficiency. Mechanistically, we show that loss of WASH inhibits the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, H2AX, and KAP1 after DSB induction and reduces chromatin relaxation and the recruitment of several downstream NHEJ factors to DSBs. Moreover, WASH role in DSB repair depends on its conserved C-terminal VCA domain and Arp2/3 activation. Our findings reveal a function and mechanistic insight for WASH in DNA DSB repair by the NHEJ pathway.
PXD030403	35037038	Thyroid hormone dependent transcriptional programming by TRbeta requires SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers. 	Thyroid Hormone Dependent Transcriptional Programming by TRb Requires SWI/SNF Chromatin Remodelers	coregulators, nuclear receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, transcription	Transcriptional regulation in response to thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine, T3) is a dynamic and cell-type specific process that maintains cellular homeostasis and identity in all tissues. However, our understanding of the mechanisms of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) actions at the molecular level are actively being refined. We used an integrated genomics approach to profile and characterize the cistrome of TRbeta, map changes in chromatin accessibility, and capture the transcriptomic changes in response to T3 in normal human thyroid cells. There are significant shifts in TRbeta genomic occupancy in response to T3, which are associated with differential chromatin accessibility, and differential recruitment of SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers. We further demonstrate selective recruitment of BAF and PBAF SWI/SNF complexes to TRbeta binding sites, revealing novel differential functions in regulating chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Our findings highlight three distinct modes of TRbeta interaction with chromatin and coordination of coregulator activity.
PXD030401	35037998	Discrimination of Tilletia controversa from the T. caries/T. laevis complex by MALDI-TOF MS analysis of teliospores. 	Discrimination of Tilletia controversa from the T. caries / T. laevis complex by MALDI-TOF MS analysis of teliospores	MALDI-TOF MS, Tilletia caries, Tilletia controversa, Tilletia laevis	The fungal genus Tilletia includes a large number of plant pathogens of Poaceae. Only a few of those cause bunt of wheat, but these species can lead to significant yield losses in crop production worldwide. Due to quarantine regulations and specific disease control using appropriate seed treatments for the different disease agents, it is of high importance to distinguish Tilletia caries and Tilletia laevis as causal agents of common bunt accurately from Tilletia controversa, the causal agent of the dwarf bunt. Several studies have shown that matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a useful tool to differentiate closely related fungal species. The aim of this study was to assess whether MALDI-TOF MS analysis is able to distinguish specimens of the three closely related pathogens T. caries, T. laevis, and T. controversa and whether it may constitute an alternative method to the morphology-based identification or germination tests. Spectral data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD030401. Spectra-based hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) of the obtained mass spectra showed two main clusters. One cluster included specimens of T. controversa, whereas the second cluster comprised T. laevis and T. caries specimens. Even though main spectral profiles (MSPs) for species identification are missing, MALDI-TOF MS has proven to be a useful method for distinguishing between T. controversa and the two causal agents of common bunt, using direct analysis of teliospores, but was unable to separate T. caries and T. laevis species. KEY POINTS: * MALDI-TOF MS was developed to classify Tilletia species causing bunt of wheat. * Best results were achieved when combining HCA and DAPC analysis. * The method resulted in an accuracy of 98.51% testing 67 Tilletia specimens.
PXD018691	35039483	Truncated PARP1 mediates ADP-ribosylation of RNA polymerase III for apoptosis. 	Truncated PARP1 promotes RNA Polymerase III during apoptosis	Turncated PARP1	Caspase-mediated cleavage of PARP1 is a surrogate marker for apoptosis. However, the biological significance of PARP1 cleavage during apoptosis is still unclear. Here, using unbiased protein affinity purification, we show that truncated PARP1 (tPARP1) recognizes the RNA polymerase III (Pol III) complex in the cytosol. tPARP1 mono-ADP-ribosylates RNA Pol III in vitro and mediates ADP-ribosylation of RNA Pol III during poly(dA-dT)-stimulated apoptosis in cells. tPARP1-mediated activation of RNA Pol III facilitates IFN-beta production and apoptosis. In contrast, suppression of PARP1 or expressing the non-cleavable form of PARP1 impairs these molecular events.

PXD012848	35039877	Proteomic analysis of inhibitor of apoptosis protein-like protein-2 on breast cancer cell proliferation. 	Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification based on quantitative proteomic analysis on inhibitor of apoptosis protein-like protein-2 knocked-down MCF-7 breast cancer cells	MCF-7, breast cancer, inhibitor of apoptosis protein-like protein-2, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification	Although inhibitor of apoptosis protein-like protein-2 (ILP-2) is considered to be a novel enhancer of breast cancer proliferation, its underlying mechanism of action remains unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the expression profile of ILP-2-related proteins in MCF-7 cells to reveal their effect on promoting breast cancer cell proliferation. The isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) method was used to analyse the expression profile of ILP-2-related proteins in MCF-7 breast cancer cells transfected with small interfering (si)RNA against ILP-2 (siRNA-5 group) and the negative control (NC) siRNA. The analysis of the iTRAQ data was carried out using western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. A total of 4,065 proteins were identified in MCF-7 cells, including 241 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs; fold change >=1.20 or <=0.83; P<0.05). Among them, 156 proteins were upregulated and 85 were downregulated in the siRNA-5 group compared with in the NC group. The aforementioned DEPs were mainly enriched in 'ECM-receptor interaction'. In addition, the top 10 biological processes related to these proteins were associated with signal transduction, cell proliferation and immune system processes. Furthermore, ILP-2 silencing upregulated N(4)-(beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl)-L-asparaginase, metallothionein-1E and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, whereas ILP-2 overexpression exerted the opposite effect. The results of the present study suggested that ILP-2 could promote breast cancer growth via regulating cell proliferation, signal transduction, immune system processes and other cellular physiological activities.
PXD028279	35040635	The Parallel Reaction Monitoring-Parallel Accumulation-Serial Fragmentation (prm-PASEF) Approach for Multiplexed Absolute Quantitation of Proteins in Human Plasma. 	The Parallel Reaction Monitoring-Parallel Accumulation Serial Fragmentation (prm-PASEF) Approach for Multiplexed Absolute Quantitation of Proteins in Human Plasma	MRM, PRM, SRM, ion mobility, timsTOF	Mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomic methods have become some of the major tools for protein biomarker discovery and validation. The recently developed parallel reaction monitoring-parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (prm-PASEF) approach on a Bruker timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer allows the addition of ion mobility as a new dimension to LC-MS-based proteomics and increases proteome coverage at a reduced analysis time. In this study, a prm-PASEF approach was used for the multiplexed absolute quantitation of proteins in human plasma using isotope-labeled peptide standards for 125 plasma proteins, over a broad (10(4)-10(6)) dynamic range. Optimization of LC and MS parameters, such as accumulation time and collision energy, resulted in improved sensitivity for more than half of the targets (73 out of 125 peptides) by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of up to 10. Overall, 41 peptides showed up to a 2-fold increase in sensitivity, 25 peptides showed up to a 5-fold increase in sensitivity, and 7 peptides showed up to a 10-fold increase in sensitivity. Implementation of the prm-PASEF method allowed absolute protein quantitation (down to 1.13 fmol) in human plasma samples. A comparison of the concentration values of plasma proteins determined by MRM on a QTRAP instrument and by prm-PASEF on a timsTOF Pro revealed an excellent correlation (R(2) = 0.97) with a slope of close to 1 (0.99), demonstrating that prm-PASEF is well suited for "absolute" quantitative proteomics.
PXD027905	35041463	A network of Galphai signaling partners is revealed by proximity labeling proteomics analysis and includes PDZ-RhoGEF. 	A Network G Protein Gai Signaling Partners is Revealed by Proximity Labeling Proteomics and Includes PDZ-RhoGEF	Cell-migration, GPCR signaling, Galphai proteins, Interactome, PDZ-RhoGEF, Proximity labeling	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that couple to the Galphai family of G proteins are key regulators of cell and tissue physiology. Our previous work has revealed new roles for Galphai in regulating the migration of neutrophils and fibrosarcoma cells downstream of activated chemoattractant receptors. Here, we used an intact cell proximity-based labeling coupled to tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis to identify proteins that selectively interacted with the GTP-bound form of Galphai1. Multiple targets were identified and validated with a BioID2-tagged, constitutively active Galphai1 mutant, suggesting a network of interactions for activated GalphaI proteins in intact cells. We showed that active Galphai1, but not Galphai2, stimulated one candidate protein, PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG), despite more than 85% sequence identity between the G proteins. We also demonstrated in primary human neutrophils that active Galphai likely regulated the polarization of phosphorylated myosin light chain, a process critical for migration, through the activation of PRG. The identification and characterization of new targets directly or indirectly regulated by Galphai will aid in the investigation of the functional roles of Galphai-coupled GPCRs in multiple biological processes.
